00:00:06.778 --> 00:00:10.878
In the 16th century, Flemish physician 
Andreas Vesalius

00:00:10.878 --> 00:00:14.628
described how a suffocating animal 
could be kept alive

00:00:14.628 --> 00:00:21.369
by inserting a tube into its trachea
and blowing air to inflate its lungs.

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.542
In 1555, this procedure didn’t warrant
much acclaim.

00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:28.902
But today, Vesalius’s treatise 
is recognized

00:00:28.902 --> 00:00:32.772
as the first description 
of mechanical ventilation—

00:00:32.772 --> 00:00:36.172
a crucial practice in modern medicine.

00:00:36.172 --> 00:00:39.142
To appreciate the value of ventilation,

00:00:39.142 --> 00:00:43.012
we need to understand how 
the respiratory system works.

00:00:43.012 --> 00:00:48.771
We breathe by contracting our diaphragms, 
which expands our chest cavities.

00:00:48.771 --> 00:00:54.088
This allows air to be drawn in, 
inflating the alveoli—

00:00:54.088 --> 00:00:58.385
millions of small sacs inside our lungs.

00:00:58.385 --> 00:01:04.258
Each of these tiny balloons is surrounded 
by a mesh of blood-filled capillaries.

00:01:04.258 --> 00:01:09.075
This blood absorbs oxygen 
from the inflated alveoli

00:01:09.075 --> 00:01:12.545
and leaves behind carbon dioxide.

00:01:12.545 --> 00:01:14.525
When the diaphragm is relaxed,

00:01:14.525 --> 00:01:20.686
the CO2 is exhaled alongside 
a mix of oxygen and other gases.

00:01:20.686 --> 00:01:23.856
When our respiratory systems 
are working correctly,

00:01:23.856 --> 00:01:26.566
this process happens automatically.

00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:31.346
But the respiratory system can be 
interrupted by a variety of conditions.

00:01:31.346 --> 00:01:36.027
Sleep apnea stops diaphragm muscles
from contracting.

00:01:36.027 --> 00:01:40.676
Asthma can lead to inflamed airways 
which obstruct oxygen.

00:01:40.676 --> 00:01:45.789
And pneumonia, often triggered 
by bacterial or viral infections,

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.649
attacks the alveoli themselves.

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.629
Invading pathogens kill lung cells,

00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:56.144
triggering an immune response 
that can cause lethal inflammation

00:01:56.144 --> 00:01:58.074
and fluid buildup.

00:01:58.074 --> 00:02:03.288
All these situations render the lungs 
unable to function normally.

00:02:03.288 --> 00:02:07.168
But mechanical ventilators 
take over the process,

00:02:07.168 --> 00:02:11.955
getting oxygen into the body 
when the respiratory system cannot.

00:02:11.955 --> 00:02:15.385
These machines can bypass 
constricted airways,

00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:22.085
and deliver highly oxygenated air 
to help damaged lungs diffuse more oxygen.

00:02:22.085 --> 00:02:25.285
There are two main ways 
ventilators can work—

00:02:25.285 --> 00:02:30.166
pumping air into the patient’s lungs 
through positive pressure ventilation,

00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:35.952
or allowing air to be passively drawn 
in through negative pressure ventilation.

00:02:35.952 --> 00:02:37.802
In the late 19th century,

00:02:37.802 --> 00:02:41.802
ventilation techniques largely 
focused on negative pressure,

00:02:41.802 --> 00:02:44.452
which closely approximates 
natural breathing

00:02:44.452 --> 00:02:48.891
and provides an even distribution 
of air in the lungs.

00:02:48.891 --> 00:02:54.196
To achieve this, doctors created 
a tight seal around the patient’s body,

00:02:54.196 --> 00:03:00.563
either by enclosing them in 
a wooden box or a specially sealed room.

00:03:00.563 --> 00:03:03.187
Air was then pumped 
out of the chamber,

00:03:03.187 --> 00:03:07.027
decreasing air pressure,
and allowing the patient’s chest cavity

00:03:07.027 --> 00:03:09.607
to expand more easily.

00:03:09.607 --> 00:03:14.702
In 1928, doctors developed 
a portable, metal device

00:03:14.702 --> 00:03:18.368
with pumps powered 
by an electric motor.

00:03:18.368 --> 00:03:21.358
This machine, known as the iron lung,

00:03:21.358 --> 00:03:26.146
became a fixture in hospitals 
through the mid-20th century.

00:03:26.146 --> 00:03:30.166
However, even the most compact 
negative pressure designs

00:03:30.166 --> 00:03:32.546
heavily restricted a patient’s movement

00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:36.336
and obstructed access for caregivers.

00:03:36.336 --> 00:03:42.337
This led hospitals in the 1960’s to shift 
towards positive pressure ventilation.

00:03:42.337 --> 00:03:46.337
For milder cases, 
this can be done non-invasively.

00:03:46.337 --> 00:03:49.727
Often, a facemask is fitted 
over the mouth and nose,

00:03:49.727 --> 00:03:54.872
and filled with pressurized air 
which moves into the patient’s airway.

00:03:54.872 --> 00:03:56.972
But more severe circumstances

00:03:56.972 --> 00:04:01.809
require a device that takes over 
the entire breathing process.

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:05.229
A tube is inserted 
into the patient’s trachea

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:07.959
to pump air directly into the lungs,

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.049
with a series of valves 
and branching pipes

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.049
forming a circuit for inhalation 
and exhalation.

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.879
In most modern ventilators,

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:18.929
an embedded computer system

00:04:18.929 --> 00:04:23.436
allows for monitoring the patient’s 
breathing and adjusting the airflow.

00:04:23.436 --> 00:04:27.220
These machines aren’t used 
as a standard treatment,

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.800
but rather, as a last resort.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.045
Enduring this influx of pressurized air 
requires heavy sedation,

00:04:35.045 --> 00:04:39.262
and repeated ventilation 
can cause long-term lung damage.

00:04:39.262 --> 00:04:41.668
But in extreme situations,

00:04:41.668 --> 00:04:45.271
ventilators can be the difference 
between life and death.

00:04:45.271 --> 00:04:48.061
And events like the COVID-19 pandemic

00:04:48.061 --> 00:04:52.041
have shown that they’re even more 
essential than we thought.

00:04:52.041 --> 00:04:55.101
Because current models 
are bulky, expensive,

00:04:55.101 --> 00:05:01.903
and require extensive training to operate,
most hospitals only have a few in supply.

00:05:01.903 --> 00:05:04.953
This may be enough 
under normal circumstances,

00:05:04.953 --> 00:05:09.197
but during emergencies, 
this limited cache is stretched thin.

00:05:09.197 --> 00:05:14.246
The world urgently needs more low-cost
and portable ventilators,

00:05:14.246 --> 00:05:18.286
as well as a faster means 
of producing and distributing

00:05:18.286 --> 00:05:20.532
this life-saving technology.
