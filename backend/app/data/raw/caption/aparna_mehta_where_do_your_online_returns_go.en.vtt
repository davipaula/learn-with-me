00:00:13.563 --> 00:00:15.500
Hi. My name is Aparna.

00:00:16.118 --> 00:00:18.463
I am a shopaholic --

00:00:18.487 --> 00:00:19.634
(Laughter)

00:00:19.658 --> 00:00:22.464
and I'm addicted to online returns.

00:00:22.488 --> 00:00:23.967
(Laughter)

00:00:25.513 --> 00:00:27.385
Well, at least I was.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.846
At one time, I had two or three
packages of clothing delivered to me

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.704
every other day.

00:00:34.728 --> 00:00:37.494
I would intentionally buy the same item

00:00:37.518 --> 00:00:40.815
in a couple different sizes
and many colors,

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:43.627
because I did not know
what I really wanted.

00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:48.823
So I overordered, I tried things on,
and then I sent what didn't work back.

00:00:50.331 --> 00:00:54.300
Once my daughter was watching me
return some of those packages back,

00:00:54.324 --> 00:00:56.625
and she said, "Mom,
I think you have a problem."

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.040
(Laughter)

00:00:58.698 --> 00:00:59.866
I didn't think so.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.488
I mean, it's free shipping
and free returns, right?

00:01:02.512 --> 00:01:03.737
(Laughter)

00:01:04.424 --> 00:01:06.416
I didn't even think twice about it,

00:01:07.214 --> 00:01:11.815
until I heard a statistic
at work that shocked me.

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:16.244
You see, I'm a global solutions
director for top-tier retail,

00:01:16.268 --> 00:01:19.539
and we were in a meeting
with one of my largest customers,

00:01:19.563 --> 00:01:22.076
discussing how to streamline costs.

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:25.735
One of their biggest concerns
was managing returns.

00:01:26.218 --> 00:01:29.462
Just this past holiday season alone,

00:01:29.486 --> 00:01:34.775
they had 7.5 million pieces
of clothing returned to them.

00:01:36.212 --> 00:01:38.301
I could not stop thinking about it.

00:01:38.325 --> 00:01:40.751
What happens to all
these returned clothes?

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.222
So I came home and researched.

00:01:44.818 --> 00:01:48.431
And I learned that every year,

00:01:48.455 --> 00:01:54.553
four billion pounds of returned clothing
ends up in the landfill.

00:01:55.864 --> 00:02:01.872
That's like every resident in the US
did a load of laundry last night

00:02:01.896 --> 00:02:03.946
and decided to throw it
in the trash today.

00:02:05.278 --> 00:02:07.442
I was horrified.

00:02:08.363 --> 00:02:10.560
I'm like, "Of all people,

00:02:10.584 --> 00:02:12.767
I should be able to help prevent this."

00:02:12.791 --> 00:02:13.929
(Laughter)

00:02:13.953 --> 00:02:18.875
My job is to find solutions
to logistical issues like these --

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:20.211
not create them.

00:02:20.937 --> 00:02:24.574
So this issue became very personal to me.

00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:27.693
I said, "You know what?
We have to solve this."

00:02:27.717 --> 00:02:32.414
And we can, with some of the existing
systems we already have in place.

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:36.512
And then I started to wonder:
How did we get here?

00:02:36.936 --> 00:02:41.653
I mean, it was only like six years ago
when a study recommended

00:02:41.677 --> 00:02:46.276
that offering free online returns
would drive customers to spend more.

00:02:46.814 --> 00:02:50.242
We started seeing companies
offering free online returns

00:02:50.266 --> 00:02:53.780
to drive more sales
and provide a better experience.

00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:56.263
What we didn't realize

00:02:56.287 --> 00:02:59.959
is that this would lead to more items
being returned as well.

00:03:01.075 --> 00:03:08.063
In the US, companies lost
$351 billion in sales

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:10.255
in 2017 alone.

00:03:11.067 --> 00:03:14.136
Retailers are scrambling
to recover their losses.

00:03:15.382 --> 00:03:18.856
They try to place that returned item
online to be sold again,

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.042
or they'll sell it to a discount partner

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:22.320
or a liquidator.

00:03:22.818 --> 00:03:26.537
Basically, if companies cannot find
a place for this item

00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:28.734
quickly and economically,

00:03:28.758 --> 00:03:30.881
its place becomes the trash.

00:03:32.413 --> 00:03:37.017
Suddenly, I felt very guilty
for being that shopper,

00:03:37.041 --> 00:03:39.240
somebody who contributes to this.

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:42.683
Who would have thought
my innocent shopping behavior

00:03:42.707 --> 00:03:44.836
would be hurting not only me,

00:03:45.693 --> 00:03:47.301
but our planet as well?

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.964
And as I thought about what to do,

00:03:50.988 --> 00:03:52.290
I kept thinking:

00:03:52.783 --> 00:03:57.731
Why does the item have to be returned
to the retailer in the first place?

00:03:58.454 --> 00:04:01.233
What if there was another way,

00:04:01.972 --> 00:04:04.529
a win-win for everyone?

00:04:05.348 --> 00:04:09.418
What if when a person
is trying to return something,

00:04:09.442 --> 00:04:12.598
it could go to the next
shopper who wants it,

00:04:12.622 --> 00:04:14.004
and not the retailer?

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.101
What if, instead of a return,

00:04:18.847 --> 00:04:23.728
they could do what I call a "green turn"?

00:04:24.783 --> 00:04:28.750
Consumers could use an app
to take pictures of the item

00:04:28.774 --> 00:04:31.930
and verify the condition
while returning it.

00:04:31.954 --> 00:04:37.069
Artificial intelligence systems could then
sort these clothes by condition --

00:04:37.093 --> 00:04:39.377
mint condition or slightly used --

00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:42.035
and direct it to the next
appropriate person.

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:45.786
Mint-condition clothes could
automatically go to the next buyer,

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.469
while slightly used clothes
could be marked down

00:04:48.493 --> 00:04:50.195
and offered online again.

00:04:50.686 --> 00:04:52.997
The retailer can decide the business rules

00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:56.832
on the number of times
a particular item can be resold.

00:04:57.616 --> 00:05:02.020
All that the consumer would need to do
is obtain a mobile code,

00:05:02.044 --> 00:05:05.644
take it to the nearest shipping place
to be packed and shipped,

00:05:05.668 --> 00:05:08.851
and off it goes from
one buyer to the next,

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:10.327
not the landfill.

00:05:11.565 --> 00:05:13.140
Now you will ask,

00:05:13.164 --> 00:05:15.822
"Would people really
go through all this trouble?"

00:05:16.359 --> 00:05:19.718
I think they would if they had incentives,

00:05:19.742 --> 00:05:22.674
like loyalty points or cash back.

00:05:22.698 --> 00:05:24.908
Let's call it "green cash."

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:28.572
There would be a whole
new opportunity to make money

00:05:28.596 --> 00:05:32.539
from this new customer base
looking to buy these returns.

00:05:33.026 --> 00:05:36.341
This system would make
a fun thing like shopping

00:05:36.365 --> 00:05:38.141
a spiritual experience

00:05:38.165 --> 00:05:40.810
that helps save our planet.

00:05:40.834 --> 00:05:43.434
(Applause)

00:05:49.144 --> 00:05:50.541
This is doable

00:05:50.565 --> 00:05:54.615
and would probably take six months
to weave some of our existing systems

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:55.946
and run a pilot.

00:05:57.208 --> 00:06:00.944
Even before any of these
logistical systems are in place,

00:06:00.968 --> 00:06:04.008
each of us shoppers can act now,

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:11.003
if every single adult in the US
made a few small changes

00:06:11.027 --> 00:06:12.443
to our shopping behavior.

00:06:13.128 --> 00:06:16.917
Take the extra time
to research and think --

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:19.553
Do I really need this item?

00:06:20.425 --> 00:06:23.534
No: Do I really want this item? --

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:26.514
before making a purchase.

00:06:26.978 --> 00:06:30.021
And if every one of us adults in the US

00:06:30.045 --> 00:06:33.630
returned five less items this year,

00:06:33.654 --> 00:06:39.762
we would keep 240 million pounds
of clothes out of the landfill.

00:06:40.443 --> 00:06:42.759
Six percent reduction, just like that.

00:06:44.125 --> 00:06:48.004
This environmental problem
that we have created

00:06:48.028 --> 00:06:49.844
is not thousands of years away;

00:06:50.416 --> 00:06:52.145
it's happening today,

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:56.787
and must stop now to prevent growing
landfills across the globe.

00:06:58.184 --> 00:07:01.355
I want to leave my daughter
and my daughter's daughter

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:04.222
a better and cleaner place
than I found it,

00:07:04.912 --> 00:07:07.980
so I have not only stopped overordering,

00:07:08.004 --> 00:07:10.031
I recycle religiously as well.

00:07:10.604 --> 00:07:13.134
And you can, too. It's not difficult.

00:07:13.739 --> 00:07:17.643
Before we fill our shopping carts
and our landfills

00:07:17.667 --> 00:07:20.298
with extra items that we don't want,

00:07:20.322 --> 00:07:23.938
let's pause next time
we are shopping online

00:07:23.962 --> 00:07:29.646
and think twice about what we all
hopefully really do want:

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.005
a beautiful Earth to call home.

00:07:32.394 --> 00:07:33.556
Thank you.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.846
(Applause)
