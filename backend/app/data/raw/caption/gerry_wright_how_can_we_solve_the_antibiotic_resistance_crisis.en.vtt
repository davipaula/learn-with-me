00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:11.865
Antibiotics: behind the scenes, 
they enable much of modern medicine.

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:14.485
We use them to cure infectious diseases,

00:00:14.485 --> 00:00:19.607
but also to safely facilitate everything 
from surgery to chemotherapy

00:00:19.607 --> 00:00:21.607
to organ transplants.

00:00:21.607 --> 00:00:23.170
Without antibiotics,

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.858
even routine medical procedures 
can lead to life-threatening infections.

00:00:27.858 --> 00:00:30.788
And we’re at risk of losing them.

00:00:30.788 --> 00:00:34.950
Antibiotics are chemicals 
that prevent the growth of bacteria.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.871
Unfortunately, some bacteria 
have become resistant

00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:42.270
to all currently available antibiotics.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.280
At the same time, 
we’ve stopped discovering new ones.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.673
Still, there’s hope that we can get ahead 
of the problem.

00:00:49.673 --> 00:00:53.160
But first, how did we 
get into this situation?

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.534
The first widely used antibiotic 
was penicillin,

00:00:56.534 --> 00:01:00.210
discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.994
In his 1945 Nobel Prize 
acceptance speech,

00:01:03.994 --> 00:01:08.707
Fleming warned that bacterial resistance 
had the potential to ruin

00:01:08.707 --> 00:01:10.987
the miracle of antibiotics.

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:13.994
He was right: in the 1940s and 50s,

00:01:13.994 --> 00:01:17.904
resistant bacteria 
already began to appear.

00:01:17.904 --> 00:01:20.234
From then until the 1980s,

00:01:20.234 --> 00:01:23.746
pharmaceutical companies 
countered the problem of resistance

00:01:23.746 --> 00:01:26.744
by discovering many new antibiotics.

00:01:26.744 --> 00:01:32.232
At first this was a highly successful— 
and highly profitable— enterprise.

00:01:32.232 --> 00:01:35.092
Over time, a couple things changed.

00:01:35.092 --> 00:01:38.582
Newly discovered antibiotics 
were often only effective

00:01:38.582 --> 00:01:41.492
for a narrow spectrum of infections,

00:01:41.492 --> 00:01:44.838
whereas the first ones 
had been broadly applicable.

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:46.812
This isn’t a problem in itself,

00:01:46.812 --> 00:01:51.072
but it does mean that fewer doses 
of these drugs could be sold—

00:01:51.072 --> 00:01:53.486
making them less profitable.

00:01:53.486 --> 00:01:57.452
In the early days, 
antibiotics were heavily overprescribed,

00:01:57.452 --> 00:02:01.262
including for viral infections 
they had no effect on.

00:02:01.262 --> 00:02:06.751
Scrutiny around prescriptions increased, 
which is good, but also lowered sales.

00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:10.381
At the same time, 
companies began to develop more drugs

00:02:10.381 --> 00:02:12.966
that are taken over a patient’s lifetime,

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.626
like blood pressure 
and cholesterol medications,

00:02:15.626 --> 00:02:20.146
and later anti-depressants 
and anti-anxiety medications.

00:02:20.146 --> 00:02:24.942
Because they are taken indefinitely, 
these drugs more profitable.

00:02:24.942 --> 00:02:30.789
By the mid-1980s, no new chemical classes 
of antibiotics were discovered.

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:35.169
But bacteria continued to acquire 
resistance and pass it along

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:39.310
by sharing genetic information 
between individual bacteria

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.726
and even across species.

00:02:41.726 --> 00:02:46.216
Now bacteria that are resistant 
to many antibiotics are common,

00:02:46.216 --> 00:02:51.954
and increasingly some strains 
are resistant to all our current drugs.

00:02:51.954 --> 00:02:54.334
So, what can we do about this?

00:02:54.334 --> 00:02:58.791
We need to control the use 
of existing antibiotics, create new ones,

00:02:58.791 --> 00:03:02.143
combat resistance to new 
and existing drugs,

00:03:02.143 --> 00:03:06.081
and find new ways to fight 
bacterial infections.

00:03:06.081 --> 00:03:10.021
The largest consumer 
of antibiotics is agriculture,

00:03:10.021 --> 00:03:13.401
which uses antibiotics not only 
to treat infections

00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:16.411
but to promote the growth of food animals.

00:03:16.411 --> 00:03:18.981
Using large volumes of antibiotics

00:03:18.981 --> 00:03:22.481
increases the bacteria’s exposure 
to the antibiotics

00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:26.851
and therefore their opportunity 
to develop resistance.

00:03:26.851 --> 00:03:32.336
Many bacteria that are common in animals, 
like salmonella, can also infect humans,

00:03:32.336 --> 00:03:36.913
and drug-resistant versions can pass 
to us through the food chain

00:03:36.913 --> 00:03:41.456
and spread through international trade 
and travel networks.

00:03:41.456 --> 00:03:44.186
In terms of finding new antibiotics,

00:03:44.186 --> 00:03:47.455
nature offers the most promising 
new compounds.

00:03:47.455 --> 00:03:52.431
Organisms like other microbes and fungi 
have evolved over millions of years

00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:54.661
to live in competitive environments—

00:03:54.661 --> 00:03:58.065
meaning they often contain 
antibiotic compounds

00:03:58.065 --> 00:04:02.285
to give them a survival advantage 
over certain bacteria.

00:04:02.285 --> 00:04:07.378
We can also package antibiotics 
with molecules that inhibit resistance.

00:04:07.378 --> 00:04:12.005
One way bacteria develop resistance 
is through proteins of their own

00:04:12.005 --> 00:04:13.745
that degrade the drug.

00:04:13.745 --> 00:04:18.275
By packaging the antibiotic with molecules
that block the degraders,

00:04:18.275 --> 00:04:21.187
the antibiotic can do its job.

00:04:21.187 --> 00:04:25.615
Phages, viruses that attack bacteria 
but don’t affect humans,

00:04:25.615 --> 00:04:29.965
are one promising new avenue 
to combat bacterial infections.

00:04:29.965 --> 00:04:33.158
Developing vaccines for common infections,
meanwhile,

00:04:33.158 --> 00:04:36.595
can help prevent disease 
in the first place.

00:04:36.595 --> 00:04:40.255
The biggest challenge to all 
these approaches is funding,

00:04:40.255 --> 00:04:43.625
which is woefully inadequate 
across the globe.

00:04:43.625 --> 00:04:48.490
Antibiotics are so unprofitable 
that many large pharmaceutical companies

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.870
have stopped trying to develop them.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.645
Meanwhile, smaller companies 
that successfully bring new antibiotics

00:04:54.645 --> 00:05:00.347
to market often still go bankrupt, 
like the American start up Achaogen.

00:05:00.347 --> 00:05:04.077
New therapeutic techniques 
like phages and vaccines

00:05:04.077 --> 00:05:08.135
face the same fundamental problem 
as traditional antibiotics:

00:05:08.135 --> 00:05:11.445
if they’re working well, 
they’re used just once,

00:05:11.445 --> 00:05:13.675
which makes it difficult to make money.

00:05:13.675 --> 00:05:17.075
And to successfully counteract resistance 
in the long term,

00:05:17.075 --> 00:05:20.595
we’ll need to use 
new antibiotics sparingly—

00:05:20.595 --> 00:05:24.495
lowering the profits 
for their creators even further.

00:05:24.495 --> 00:05:30.706
One possible solution is to shift profits 
away from the volume of antibiotics sold.

00:05:30.706 --> 00:05:33.906
For example, the United Kingdom 
is testing a model

00:05:33.906 --> 00:05:38.024
where healthcare providers 
purchase antibiotic subscriptions.

00:05:38.024 --> 00:05:42.164
While governments are looking for ways 
to incentivize antibiotic development,

00:05:42.164 --> 00:05:45.104
these programs are still 
in the early stages.

00:05:45.104 --> 00:05:48.414
Countries around the world 
will need to do much more—

00:05:48.414 --> 00:05:51.964
but with enough investment 
in antibiotic development

00:05:51.964 --> 00:05:54.604
and controlled use of our current drugs,

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:57.254
we can still get ahead of resistance.
