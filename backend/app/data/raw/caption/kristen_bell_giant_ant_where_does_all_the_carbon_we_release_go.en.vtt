00:00:01.587 --> 00:00:04.066
Where does all the carbon
we release go?

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.809
Carbon works in a natural cycle,
present in all living things:

00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:10.777
in the soil, in the oceans,
in the atmosphere

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:13.406
and in rocks deep underground.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.686
When plants and other living things die,

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.315
much of their stored carbon
makes its way back to the atmosphere

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:22.448
until new plants grow
and reabsorb the carbon.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.691
But over millions of years,

00:00:24.715 --> 00:00:28.806
some of the carbon stored in ancient trees
and sea life becomes rock

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.347
and some becomes fossil fuels:

00:00:31.371 --> 00:00:34.056
coal, oil and natural gas.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.596
Natural events like volcanic eruptions

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.356
release some of the carbon
trapped in rock.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.420
And human activities,
like burning fossil fuels,

00:00:42.444 --> 00:00:45.554
also release some
of that prehistoric carbon.

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:49.656
Today, humans release
around 60 times more carbon

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.246
than all the volcanoes
on the planet each year.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.686
That overloads Earth's carbon cycle

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.360
and builds up in the atmosphere

00:00:56.384 --> 00:00:57.575
and oceans.

00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:02.448
Planting more trees will help,
but trees alone can't get us to net zero.

00:01:02.472 --> 00:01:05.386
There's only one sure way
to stop global warming.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.788
We must stop releasing
this excess carbon into our air.
