00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:15.018
In our culture we tend to see sex

00:00:15.042 --> 00:00:19.393
as something that's more important
to men than it is to women.

00:00:19.417 --> 00:00:21.018
But that's not true.

00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:25.208
What is true is that women often feel
more shame in talking about it.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.625
Over half of women quietly suffer
from some kind of sexual dysfunction.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.417
We've been hearing
more about the orgasm gap.

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:38.476
It's kind of like the wage gap
but stickier ...

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.667
(Laughter)

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:44.643
Straight women tend to reach climax

00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:48.167
less than 60 percent
of the time they have sex.

00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:52.917
Men reach climax 90 percent
of the time they have sex.

00:00:53.833 --> 00:00:57.184
To address these issues,
women have been sold flawed medication,

00:00:57.208 --> 00:00:59.809
testosterone creams ...

00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:03.208
even untested genital injections.

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:09.042
The thing is, female sexuality
can't be fixed with a pill.

00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.309
That's because it's not broken:

00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:14.042
it's misunderstood.

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:19.143
Our culture has had a skewed
and medically incorrect picture

00:01:19.167 --> 00:01:21.143
of female sexuality

00:01:21.167 --> 00:01:23.684
going back centuries.

00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:28.434
If over half of women
have some kind of sexual problem,

00:01:28.458 --> 00:01:32.292
maybe our idea of sexuality
doesn't work for women.

00:01:33.083 --> 00:01:37.083
We need a clearer understanding
of how women actually work.

00:01:38.917 --> 00:01:40.184
I'm a journalist,

00:01:40.208 --> 00:01:41.643
and I recently wrote a book

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:46.000
about how our understanding
of female sexuality is evolving.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.250
So sexuality itself was defined
back when men dominated science.

00:01:53.208 --> 00:01:55.434
Male scientists
tended to see the female body

00:01:55.458 --> 00:01:57.601
through their own skewed lens.

00:01:57.625 --> 00:02:01.809
They could've just asked women
about their experience.

00:02:01.833 --> 00:02:07.393
Instead they probed the female body
like it was a foreign landscape.

00:02:07.417 --> 00:02:13.226
Even today we debate the existence
of female ejaculation and the G-spot

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.292
like we're talking about aliens or UFOs.

00:02:17.167 --> 00:02:19.559
"Are they really out there?"

00:02:19.583 --> 00:02:22.018
(Laughter)

00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:25.684
All this goes double for LGBTQI
women's sexuality,

00:02:25.708 --> 00:02:28.917
which has been hated
and erased in specific ways.

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:34.809
Ignorance about the female body
goes back centuries.

00:02:34.833 --> 00:02:37.518
It goes back to the beginning
of modern medicine.

00:02:37.542 --> 00:02:40.434
Cast your mind back to the 16th century,

00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:44.768
a time of scientific revolution in Europe.

00:02:44.792 --> 00:02:47.917
Men of ideas were challenging old dogmas.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.726
They were building telescopes
to gaze up at the stars.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.143
We were making progress ...

00:02:55.167 --> 00:02:56.684
sometimes.

00:02:56.708 --> 00:02:59.268
You see, the fathers of anatomy --

00:02:59.292 --> 00:03:03.518
and I say "fathers" because,
let's face it, they were all dudes --

00:03:03.542 --> 00:03:06.018
were poking about between women's legs

00:03:06.042 --> 00:03:08.917
and trying to classify what they saw.

00:03:09.833 --> 00:03:13.708
They weren't quite sure
what to do with the clitoris.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.792
It didn't appear to have
anything to do with making babies.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.601
The leading anatomist at the time declared

00:03:21.625 --> 00:03:25.434
that it was probably
some kind of abnormal growth --

00:03:25.458 --> 00:03:26.476
(Laughter)

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.708
and that any woman who had one
was probably a hermaphrodite.

00:03:31.875 --> 00:03:37.018
It got so bad that parents would sometimes
have their daughter's clitoris cut off

00:03:37.042 --> 00:03:39.309
if it was deemed too large.

00:03:39.333 --> 00:03:40.601
That's right.

00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:44.643
Something we think of today
as female genital mutilation

00:03:44.667 --> 00:03:48.833
was practiced in the West
as late as the 20th century.

00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.226
You have to wonder:

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.434
if they were that confused
about women's bodies,

00:03:54.458 --> 00:03:56.958
why didn't they just ask women
for a little help?

00:03:58.667 --> 00:04:01.750
But you must be thinking,
"All that was history.

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:04.684
It's a different world now.

00:04:04.708 --> 00:04:05.976
Women have everything.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.143
They have the birth control pill,

00:04:08.167 --> 00:04:12.434
they have sexting
and Tinder and vajazzling."

00:04:12.458 --> 00:04:14.292
(Laughter)

00:04:15.542 --> 00:04:18.125
Things must be better now.

00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:22.750
But medical ignorance
of the female body continues.

00:04:25.833 --> 00:04:27.875
How many of you recognize this?

00:04:28.875 --> 00:04:32.017
It's the full structure of the clitoris.

00:04:32.041 --> 00:04:35.476
We think of the clitoris
as this little pea-sized nub,

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.559
but actually it extends
deep into the body.

00:04:38.583 --> 00:04:40.893
Most of it lies under the skin.

00:04:40.917 --> 00:04:44.875
It contains almost as much
erectile tissue as the penis.

00:04:46.375 --> 00:04:47.667
It's beautiful, isn't it?

00:04:48.333 --> 00:04:49.934
It looks a little like a swan.

00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.893
(Laughter)

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:55.309
This sculpture is by an artist
named Sophia Wallace

00:04:55.333 --> 00:04:58.434
as part of her "Cliteracy" project.

00:04:58.458 --> 00:04:59.768
(Laughter)

00:04:59.792 --> 00:05:01.893
She believes we need more "cliteracy,"

00:05:01.917 --> 00:05:04.309
and it's true, considering
that this structure

00:05:04.333 --> 00:05:09.708
was only fully 3-D mapped
by researchers in 2009.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.268
That was after we finished mapping
the entire human genome.

00:05:15.292 --> 00:05:18.292
(Laughter)

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.643
This ignorance has real-life consequences.

00:05:23.667 --> 00:05:26.101
In a medical journal in 2005,

00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:28.726
Dr. Helen O'Connell, a urologist,

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.601
warned her colleagues that this structure
was still nowhere to be found

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:35.851
in basic medical journals --

00:05:35.875 --> 00:05:37.750
textbooks like "Gray's Anatomy."

00:05:39.042 --> 00:05:42.792
This could have serious
consequences for surgery.

00:05:43.667 --> 00:05:45.476
Take this in.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.893
Gentlemen:

00:05:46.917 --> 00:05:50.684
imagine if you were at risk
of losing your penis

00:05:50.708 --> 00:05:54.559
because doctors weren't
totally sure where it was

00:05:54.583 --> 00:05:56.375
or what it looked like.

00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.393
Unsurprisingly,

00:05:59.417 --> 00:06:03.476
many women aren't too clear
on their own genital anatomy either.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.893
You can't really blame them.

00:06:04.917 --> 00:06:09.417
The clitoris is often missing
from many sex-ed diagrams, too.

00:06:10.667 --> 00:06:16.059
Women can sense that their culture
views their bodies with confusion at best,

00:06:16.083 --> 00:06:18.625
outright disdain and disgust at worst.

00:06:19.458 --> 00:06:23.917
Many women still view their own genitals
as dirty or inadequate.

00:06:24.875 --> 00:06:27.559
They're increasingly
comparing their vulvas

00:06:27.583 --> 00:06:31.583
with the neat and tiny ones
they see in pornography.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.018
It's one reason why labiaplasty
is becoming a skyrocketing business

00:06:37.042 --> 00:06:39.625
among women and teen girls.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.393
Some people feel
that all this is a trivial issue.

00:06:46.417 --> 00:06:48.934
I was writing my book
when I was at a dinner party

00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:53.208
and someone said, "Isn't sexuality
a first-world problem?

00:06:54.542 --> 00:06:58.542
Aren't women dealing with more
important issues all over the world?"

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.226
Of course they are.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:06.476
But I think the impulse to trivialize sex
is part of our problem.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.309
We live in a culture
that seems obsessed with sex.

00:07:10.333 --> 00:07:12.750
We use it to sell everything.

00:07:13.417 --> 00:07:14.976
We tell women that looking sexy

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.542
is one of the most important
things you can do.

00:07:18.708 --> 00:07:21.809
But what we really do is we belittle sex.

00:07:21.833 --> 00:07:26.309
We reduce it to a sad shadow
of what it truly is.

00:07:26.333 --> 00:07:29.000
Sex is more than just an act.

00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.726
I spoke with Dr. Lori Brotto,

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.226
a psychologist who treats
sexual issues in women,

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.042
including survivors of trauma.

00:07:37.833 --> 00:07:43.042
She says the hundreds of women she sees
all tend to repeat the same thing.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.208
They say, "I don't feel whole."

00:07:47.292 --> 00:07:51.417
They feel they've lost a connection
with their partners and themselves.

00:07:52.417 --> 00:07:55.226
So what is sex?

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.184
We've traditionally defined the act of sex

00:07:58.208 --> 00:08:02.434
as a linear, goal-oriented process.

00:08:02.458 --> 00:08:05.143
It's something that starts with lust,

00:08:05.167 --> 00:08:08.101
continues to heavy petting

00:08:08.125 --> 00:08:10.500
and finishes with a happy ending.

00:08:11.542 --> 00:08:14.583
Except many women
don't experience it this way.

00:08:18.042 --> 00:08:22.042
It's less linear for them
and more circular.

00:08:22.875 --> 00:08:26.268
This is a new model
of women's arousal and desire

00:08:26.292 --> 00:08:29.434
developed by Dr. Rosemary Basson.

00:08:29.458 --> 00:08:30.726
It says many things,

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:35.559
including that women can begin
an encounter for many different reasons

00:08:35.583 --> 00:08:37.184
that aren't desire,

00:08:37.208 --> 00:08:39.083
like curiosity.

00:08:39.583 --> 00:08:44.933
They can finish with a climax
or multiple climaxes,

00:08:44.957 --> 00:08:48.582
or satisfaction without a climax at all.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.000
All options are normal.

00:08:52.957 --> 00:08:58.976
Some people are starting to champion
a richer definition of sexuality.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.268
Whether you identify as male,
female or neither gender,

00:09:03.292 --> 00:09:07.351
sex is about our relationship
to the senses.

00:09:07.375 --> 00:09:09.125
It's about slowing down,

00:09:09.917 --> 00:09:11.684
listening to the body,

00:09:11.708 --> 00:09:13.875
coming into the present moment.

00:09:14.667 --> 00:09:17.000
It's about our whole health
and well-being.

00:09:18.667 --> 00:09:19.934
In other words,

00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:24.934
sex at its true breadth isn't profane,

00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.208
it's sacred.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:33.434
That's one reason why women
are redefining their sexuality today.

00:09:33.458 --> 00:09:36.458
They're asking: What is sex for me?

00:09:37.792 --> 00:09:42.809
So they're experimenting with practices
that are less about the happy ending --

00:09:42.833 --> 00:09:44.875
more about feeling whole.

00:09:45.708 --> 00:09:48.893
So they're trying out
spiritual sex classes,

00:09:48.917 --> 00:09:51.101
masturbation workshops --

00:09:51.125 --> 00:09:53.643
even shooting their own porn

00:09:53.667 --> 00:09:56.875
that celebrates the diversity
of real bodies.

00:09:58.167 --> 00:10:02.559
For anyone who still feels
this is a trivial issue, consider this:

00:10:02.583 --> 00:10:06.143
understanding your body
is crucial to the huge issue

00:10:06.167 --> 00:10:08.833
of sex education and consent.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.976
By deeply, intimately knowing
what kind of touch feels right,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.768
what pressure, what speed, what context,

00:10:18.792 --> 00:10:22.101
you can better know
what kind of touch feels wrong

00:10:22.125 --> 00:10:24.167
and have the confidence to say so.

00:10:25.292 --> 00:10:29.476
This isn't ultimately about women
having more or better sex.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.917
It's not about making sure
women have as many orgasms as men.

00:10:34.875 --> 00:10:40.726
It's about accepting yourself
and your own unique experience.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.958
It's about you being
the expert on your body.

00:10:44.708 --> 00:10:50.518
It's about defining pleasure
and satisfaction on your terms.

00:10:50.542 --> 00:10:54.351
And if that means you're happiest
having no sex at all,

00:10:54.375 --> 00:10:55.667
that's perfect, too.

00:10:57.125 --> 00:11:01.309
If we define sex as part
of our whole health and well-being,

00:11:01.333 --> 00:11:05.434
then empowering women
and girls to fully own it

00:11:05.458 --> 00:11:07.917
is a crucial next step toward equality.

00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:13.018
And I think it would be
a better world not just for women

00:11:13.042 --> 00:11:14.684
but for everyone.

00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:15.976
Thank you.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.833
(Applause)
