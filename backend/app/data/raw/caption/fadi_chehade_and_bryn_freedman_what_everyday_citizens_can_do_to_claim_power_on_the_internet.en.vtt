00:00:12.461 --> 00:00:15.872
Bryn Freedman: So you said
that in the 20th century,

00:00:15.896 --> 00:00:18.717
global power was in the hands
of government.

00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:21.210
At the beginning of this digital century,

00:00:21.234 --> 00:00:22.995
it really moved to corporations

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.924
and that in the future,
it would move to individuals.

00:00:26.948 --> 00:00:28.734
And I've interviewed a lot of people,

00:00:28.758 --> 00:00:30.610
and they say you're wrong,

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:32.753
and they are betting on the companies.

00:00:32.777 --> 00:00:34.436
So why are you right,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.943
and why are individuals going to win out?

00:00:37.419 --> 00:00:39.968
Fadi ChehadÃ©: Because companies
cater to individuals,

00:00:39.992 --> 00:00:42.025
and we as the citizenry

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:46.540
need to start understanding
that we have a big role

00:00:46.564 --> 00:00:49.600
in shaping how the world
will be governed, moving forward.

00:00:49.624 --> 00:00:53.891
Yes, indeed, the tug of war right now
is between governments,

00:00:53.915 --> 00:00:56.985
who lost much of their power to companies

00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:01.267
because the internet is not built
around the nation-state system

00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:03.331
around which governments have power.

00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:05.212
The internet is transnational.

00:01:05.236 --> 00:01:08.275
It's not international,
and it's not national,

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.139
and therefore the companies
became very powerful.

00:01:12.028 --> 00:01:13.902
They shape our economy.

00:01:13.926 --> 00:01:15.918
They shape our society.

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:17.585
Governments don't know what to do.

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:19.625
Right now, they're reacting.

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.943
And I fear that if we do not,
as the citizenry --

00:01:22.967 --> 00:01:27.715
which are, in my opinion,
the most important leg of that stool --

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:29.261
don't take our role,

00:01:29.285 --> 00:01:30.478
then you are right.

00:01:30.502 --> 00:01:35.263
The detractors, or the people telling you
that businesses will prevail, are right.

00:01:35.287 --> 00:01:36.438
It will happen.

00:01:36.462 --> 00:01:40.294
BF: So are you saying that individuals
will force businesses

00:01:40.318 --> 00:01:42.826
or business will be forced
to be responsive,

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.223
or is there a fear that they won't be?

00:01:46.247 --> 00:01:47.619
FC: I think they will be.

00:01:47.643 --> 00:01:49.493
Look at two weeks ago,

00:01:49.517 --> 00:01:53.929
a small company called Skip
winning over Uber and Lyft and everyone

00:01:53.953 --> 00:01:58.881
to actually get the license
for the San Francisco scooter business.

00:01:59.232 --> 00:02:01.398
And if you read why did Skip win,

00:02:01.422 --> 00:02:04.318
because Skip listened
to the people of San Francisco,

00:02:04.342 --> 00:02:07.191
who were tired of scooters
being thrown everywhere,

00:02:07.215 --> 00:02:09.889
and actually went to the city and said,

00:02:09.913 --> 00:02:12.079
"We will deploy the service,

00:02:12.103 --> 00:02:15.159
but we will respond
to the people's requirements

00:02:15.183 --> 00:02:18.253
that we organize ourselves
around a set of rules."

00:02:18.277 --> 00:02:21.643
They self-governed their behavior,
and they won the contract

00:02:21.667 --> 00:02:23.707
over some very powerful companies.

00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:27.297
BF: So speaking of guidelines
and self-governance,

00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:31.342
you've spent an entire lifetime
creating guidelines and norms

00:02:31.366 --> 00:02:33.064
for the internet.

00:02:33.088 --> 00:02:34.827
Do you think those days are over?

00:02:34.851 --> 00:02:37.613
Who is going to guide,
who is going to control,

00:02:37.637 --> 00:02:39.788
and who is going to create those norms?

00:02:39.812 --> 00:02:45.172
FC: The rules that govern
the technology layers of the internet

00:02:45.196 --> 00:02:47.879
are now well put in place,

00:02:47.903 --> 00:02:51.355
and I was very busy for a few years
setting those rules

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.496
around the part of the internet
that makes the internet one network.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.005
The domain-name system, the IP numbers,

00:02:58.029 --> 00:02:59.745
all of that is in place.

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.103
However, as we get now
into the upper layers of the internet,

00:03:04.127 --> 00:03:06.953
the issues that affect
me and you every day --

00:03:06.977 --> 00:03:09.779
privacy, security, etc. --

00:03:09.803 --> 00:03:16.803
the system to create norms for those
unfortunately is not in place.

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:18.713
So we do have an issue.

00:03:18.737 --> 00:03:22.387
We have a system
of cooperation and governance

00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:25.245
that really needs to be created right now

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.000
so that companies, governments
and the citizenry can agree

00:03:30.024 --> 00:03:32.366
how this new digital world
is going to advance.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.572
BF: So what gives
a digital company any incentive?

00:03:35.596 --> 00:03:37.621
Let's say -- Facebook comes to mind --

00:03:37.645 --> 00:03:40.590
they would say they have
their users' best interests at heart,

00:03:40.614 --> 00:03:43.153
but I think a lot of people
would disagree with that.

00:03:43.177 --> 00:03:49.085
FC: It's been very difficult to watch
how tech companies have reacted

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.148
to the citizenry's response
to their technologies.

00:03:52.791 --> 00:03:56.475
And some of them, two or three years ago,
basically dismissed it.

00:03:56.499 --> 00:04:01.864
The word that I heard in many board rooms
is, "We're just a technology platform.

00:04:01.888 --> 00:04:04.776
It's not my issue
if my technology platform

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.611
causes families
to go kill their girls in Pakistan.

00:04:07.635 --> 00:04:09.922
It's not my issue. It's their problem.

00:04:09.946 --> 00:04:11.915
I just have a technology platform."

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:15.154
Now, I think we are now entering a stage

00:04:15.178 --> 00:04:20.489
where companies are starting to realize
this is no longer sustainable,

00:04:20.513 --> 00:04:22.679
and they're starting to see the pushback

00:04:22.703 --> 00:04:25.838
that's coming
from people, users, citizens,

00:04:25.862 --> 00:04:28.476
but also governments
that are starting to say,

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.063
"This cannot be."

00:04:30.087 --> 00:04:35.516
So I think there is a maturity
that is starting to set,

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.014
especially in that Silicon Valley area,

00:04:38.038 --> 00:04:42.561
where people are beginning to say,
"We have a role."

00:04:42.585 --> 00:04:45.141
So when I speak to these leaders, I say,

00:04:45.165 --> 00:04:49.018
"Look, you could be the CEO,
a very successful CEO of a company,

00:04:49.042 --> 00:04:51.113
but you could also be a steward."

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:52.882
And that's the key word.

00:04:52.906 --> 00:04:56.458
"You could be a steward
of the power you have

00:04:56.482 --> 00:05:00.394
to shape the lives and the economies
of billions of people.

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.551
Which one do you want to be?"

00:05:03.218 --> 00:05:05.821
And the answer is,
it's not one or the other.

00:05:06.568 --> 00:05:09.049
This is what we are missing right now.

00:05:09.073 --> 00:05:13.101
So when an adult like Brad Smith,
the president of Microsoft,

00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:14.613
said a few months ago,

00:05:14.637 --> 00:05:17.557
"We need a new set of Geneva Conventions

00:05:17.581 --> 00:05:20.270
to manage the security
of the digital space,"

00:05:20.294 --> 00:05:23.961
many of the senior leaders
in Silicon Valley

00:05:23.985 --> 00:05:27.302
actually spoke against his words.

00:05:27.326 --> 00:05:29.162
"What do you mean, Geneva Convention?

00:05:29.186 --> 00:05:32.133
We don't need any Geneva Conventions.
We self-regulate."

00:05:32.157 --> 00:05:34.265
But that mood is changing,

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.495
and I'm starting to see many leaders say,

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:38.814
"Help us out."

00:05:39.201 --> 00:05:41.254
But here lies the conundrum.

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:44.822
Who is going to help those leaders
do the right thing?

00:05:44.846 --> 00:05:47.425
BF: So who is going to help them?

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:51.585
Because I'd love
to interview you for an hour,

00:05:51.609 --> 00:05:56.838
but give me your biggest fear
and your best hope

00:05:56.862 --> 00:05:58.743
for how this is going to work out.

00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:07.720
FC: My biggest hope
is that we will become each stewards

00:06:07.744 --> 00:06:09.334
of this new digital world.

00:06:09.358 --> 00:06:10.739
That's my biggest hope,

00:06:10.763 --> 00:06:15.787
because I do think, often,
we want to put the blame on others.

00:06:15.811 --> 00:06:18.212
"Oh, it's these CEOs.
They're behaving this way."

00:06:18.236 --> 00:06:20.236
"These governments are not doing enough."

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.924
But how about us?

00:06:21.948 --> 00:06:27.020
How is each of us actually taking
the responsibility to be a steward

00:06:27.044 --> 00:06:29.273
of the digital space we live in?

00:06:29.297 --> 00:06:32.520
And one of the things I've been pushing
on university presidents

00:06:32.544 --> 00:06:36.884
is we need every engineering and science
and computer science student

00:06:36.908 --> 00:06:39.443
who is about to write
the next line of code

00:06:39.467 --> 00:06:41.776
or design the next IoT device

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.627
to actually have in them
a sense of responsibility and stewardship

00:06:46.651 --> 00:06:48.160
towards what they're building.

00:06:48.184 --> 00:06:50.580
So I suggested we create a new oath,

00:06:50.604 --> 00:06:52.263
like the Hippocratic Oath,

00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:55.215
so that every student
entering an engineering program

00:06:55.239 --> 00:06:58.840
takes a technocratic oath or a wisdom oath

00:06:58.864 --> 00:07:01.777
or some oath of commitment
to the rest of us.

00:07:01.801 --> 00:07:04.477
That's my best hope, that we all rise.

00:07:04.501 --> 00:07:09.414
Because governments and businesses
will fight over this power game,

00:07:09.438 --> 00:07:10.972
but where are we?

00:07:10.996 --> 00:07:15.448
And unless we play into that power table,

00:07:15.472 --> 00:07:18.371
I think we'll end up in a bad place.

00:07:18.395 --> 00:07:19.670
My biggest fear?

00:07:21.392 --> 00:07:24.256
My biggest fear,
to be very tactical today,

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.519
what is keeping me up at night

00:07:26.543 --> 00:07:32.257
is the current war between
the West, the liberal world,

00:07:33.304 --> 00:07:34.813
and China,

00:07:34.837 --> 00:07:37.114
in the area of artificial intelligence.

00:07:37.138 --> 00:07:39.384
There is a real war going on,

00:07:39.408 --> 00:07:44.399
and for those of us who have lived
through the nuclear nonproliferation age

00:07:44.423 --> 00:07:46.787
and saw how people agreed

00:07:46.811 --> 00:07:49.601
to take some very dangerous
things off the table,

00:07:50.787 --> 00:07:54.110
well, the Carnegie Endowment
just finished a study.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.221
They talked to every country
that made nuclear weapons

00:07:57.245 --> 00:07:59.022
and asked them,

00:07:59.046 --> 00:08:04.805
"Which digital 'weapon'
would you take off the table

00:08:04.829 --> 00:08:07.423
against somebody else's
schools or hospitals?"

00:08:07.828 --> 00:08:09.027
And the answer --

00:08:09.051 --> 00:08:12.495
from every nuclear power --
to this question was,

00:08:13.447 --> 00:08:14.597
nothing.

00:08:15.693 --> 00:08:17.486
That's what I'm worried about ...

00:08:18.161 --> 00:08:21.081
The weaponization of the digital space,

00:08:21.105 --> 00:08:22.717
and the race to get there.

00:08:22.741 --> 00:08:25.536
BF: Well, it sounds like
you've got a lot of work to do,

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.131
and so do the rest of us.

00:08:27.155 --> 00:08:29.841
Fadi, thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

00:08:29.865 --> 00:08:31.016
FC: Thank you.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.579
(Applause)
