00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.344
I believe that we can both

00:00:14.344 --> 00:00:16.108
unravel the mysteries of the universe,

00:00:16.108 --> 00:00:19.732
and save human lives at the same time

00:00:19.732 --> 00:00:22.317
through interdisciplinary research.

00:00:22.317 --> 00:00:23.901
And I'm gonna share with you today

00:00:23.901 --> 00:00:28.351
just one story, my story, that has crossed these paths.

00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:32.056
And we start the in supernova remnant Casiopea A,

00:00:32.056 --> 00:00:35.827
it's one of the youngest ones in our galaxy, about 330 years old.

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:38.321
An astronomy colleague approached me one day.

00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:41.668
And she had over 8 years of magnificent data,

00:00:41.668 --> 00:00:45.755
just trying to understand the 3D structure of this nebula,

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:49.700
the supernova remnant, but she had no way to look at it.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.021
So I looked at the data with her and said, "I think I can help you."

00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:56.070
And although -- and this is all real data

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.537
you're seeing on the screen above me --

00:00:58.537 --> 00:01:00.445
this is the Hollywood rendering version,

00:01:00.445 --> 00:01:05.245
but the rough draft I made with her, looks something more like this.

00:01:05.245 --> 00:01:07.066
And she was able to make novel discoveries

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:11.560
about how supernovas explode, and how shells explode within it,

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.310
using a piece of software developed at

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.243
Brigham and Women's Hospital, here in Boston,

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:19.356
called "3D Slicer", and it was

00:01:19.356 --> 00:01:23.071
originally developed for looking at patients' brain scans

00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:27.124
during surgical planning and doing 3D renderings of anatomy.

00:01:27.124 --> 00:01:31.417
Who knew our solution was lurking just across the river.

00:01:31.417 --> 00:01:34.869
Now, people don't believe me when I tell them

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.359
that astronomy and medical imaging,

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:40.122
these two seemingly different fields, are really similar.

00:01:40.122 --> 00:01:43.265
So we're gonna play a little game I like to call "Which is which."

00:01:43.265 --> 00:01:46.106
I play this with new doctors and astronomers I work with.

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:47.962
I'm gonna show you two images on the screen.

00:01:47.962 --> 00:01:51.567
One of them is biomedical and one of them is astronomical

00:01:51.567 --> 00:01:54.677
and you have to pick them correctly in your head.

00:01:54.677 --> 00:01:56.338
So, here is the first set.

00:01:56.338 --> 00:02:01.148
And again, one of these is a biomedical and one is astronomical.

00:02:01.148 --> 00:02:07.331
I'll give you a second to make your little vote mentally --

00:02:07.331 --> 00:02:09.262
So it turns out the one on the left

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:12.065
is some of the raw data of the supernova remnant

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:14.612
we were just looking at, and on the right we have

00:02:14.612 --> 00:02:17.548
an angiogram of a patient's heart and coronary arteries.

00:02:17.548 --> 00:02:18.818
Okay, we're gonna try another one.

00:02:18.818 --> 00:02:22.450
Now, this one is much closer to my daily bread and butter.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.151
Now, tell me which is which.

00:02:25.151 --> 00:02:27.684
And one of these is literally millimeters across,

00:02:27.684 --> 00:02:31.269
and the other is billions of miles.

00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:37.734
So, it turns out the one on the left

00:02:37.734 --> 00:02:40.336
is a confocal microscopy image of a human cornea,

00:02:40.336 --> 00:02:43.668
and, on the right, we have a radio telescope image

00:02:43.668 --> 00:02:46.609
of the star forming region NGC-1333.

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.969
Now, aside from the fact that these images look similar,

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:51.819
and doctors trying to find like a tumor on a patient's brain,

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.458
or a young star forming is similar,

00:02:53.458 --> 00:02:55.487
the way the data comes from the machine

00:02:55.487 --> 00:02:58.336
or the telescope, is remarkably similar.

00:02:58.336 --> 00:03:00.532
So, here's a MRI scanner,

00:03:00.532 --> 00:03:02.898
and if you've never seen the raw data

00:03:02.898 --> 00:03:05.051
of a patient's brain, this is what it looks like.

00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:07.765
And when the MRI scanner is acquiring the data

00:03:07.765 --> 00:03:10.840
it goes in slices, so you can see the patient's nose,

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.154
their eyes, it kinda progresses towards the middle of the head;

00:03:14.154 --> 00:03:17.960
you can start to see the cortex, and it steps through

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.945
to the back of the brain.

00:03:19.945 --> 00:03:21.971
Now, believe it or not, telescopes,

00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:26.058
and particularly radio telescopes, operate in a similar manner.

00:03:26.058 --> 00:03:28.252
If we were to look at the raw data from these telescopes,

00:03:28.252 --> 00:03:31.741
we're gonna look at a nebula called M16,

00:03:31.741 --> 00:03:35.753
and we start with this radio telescope at the front of the nebula,

00:03:35.753 --> 00:03:37.767
stepping back towards the middle of the nebula,

00:03:37.767 --> 00:03:40.140
just like the middle of the patient's brain,

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.941
and all those bright regions are where young stars are forming,

00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:45.064
all the way to the back of the nebula,

00:03:45.064 --> 00:03:47.616
just like the back of the patient's head.

00:03:47.616 --> 00:03:52.003
Now, although the doctors are able to then take this data

00:03:52.003 --> 00:03:54.162
and look at the 3D, and do surgical planning.

00:03:54.162 --> 00:03:57.414
This is like cutting-edge, just about as good as what you get

00:03:57.414 --> 00:04:00.011
with any astronomer and this is what they have to look at,

00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:06.857
to understand the 3D structure and velocity's momentum in our universe.

00:04:06.857 --> 00:04:08.333
But we can do better.

00:04:08.333 --> 00:04:11.647
So, you might recognize this nebula, more like this:

00:04:11.647 --> 00:04:15.696
the famous Hubble image of the Pillars of Creation or the Eagle nebula.

00:04:15.696 --> 00:04:18.979
And, I'm gonna fade this out onto a radio image,

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.000
it's a false color in the background,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.932
and fade away the Hubble's image you're used to.

00:04:23.932 --> 00:04:27.894
But, we don't need to just look at this in 3D, we look at it in 2D,

00:04:27.894 --> 00:04:31.964
and here I'm using a radiology tool kit called OsiriX.

00:04:31.964 --> 00:04:35.049
When I showed this to astronomer Marc Pound,

00:04:35.049 --> 00:04:37.463
whose data this is, he was amazed,

00:04:37.463 --> 00:04:40.593
because he had been trying so hard to study

00:04:40.593 --> 00:04:43.147
the impact of a young group of stars, and he had this theory

00:04:43.147 --> 00:04:46.234
that there's wind crashing and tossing the pillars over,

00:04:46.234 --> 00:04:48.566
and it took him months to prove this

00:04:48.566 --> 00:04:51.391
with conventional visualization. But, in one shot,

00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:54.732
you can see the shock wave of wind blasting through

00:04:54.732 --> 00:04:57.462
across to the left hand side of the screen.

00:04:57.462 --> 00:05:00.436
Now, I don't think myself or any of my collaborators

00:05:00.436 --> 00:05:03.283
would've anticipated how far this has gone,

00:05:03.283 --> 00:05:05.864
and by sharing the medical technology of astronomy

00:05:05.864 --> 00:05:08.510
and astronomy with medical, we've been able to find

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.450
new stars, and supernova remnants,

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.802
and revolutionize how you do heart diagnostics,

00:05:13.802 --> 00:05:18.448
and look at data for different patients and organize it in data mind net.

00:05:18.448 --> 00:05:20.334
Now, I don't have time to show you all these great projects.

00:05:20.334 --> 00:05:21.958
But I'll show you one of them.

00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.619
This is a collaboration I've been working on,

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:26.398
called the multiscale hemodynamics project,

00:05:26.398 --> 00:05:29.007
working with doctors at Brigham &amp;amp; Women's hospital.

00:05:29.007 --> 00:05:32.215
Now, what this represents is a novel way of doing

00:05:32.215 --> 00:05:35.811
heart disease diagnostics. And, instead of the conventional

00:05:35.811 --> 00:05:39.582
invasive angiography, this is just a CT scan,

00:05:39.582 --> 00:05:41.837
and what you see here are the coronary arteries.

00:05:41.837 --> 00:05:42.832
So, you have your heart

00:05:42.832 --> 00:05:45.603
and the arteries wrap around the outside,

00:05:45.603 --> 00:05:48.121
these are the arteries you worry about getting blocked,

00:05:48.121 --> 00:05:50.422
and giving you a heart attack, and killing you.

00:05:50.422 --> 00:05:53.051
So, it's really important that we look at them.

00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:55.067
Now, this is a CT scan of a patient

00:05:55.067 --> 00:05:59.678
with a blood flow simulation, that's the coloring up there;

00:05:59.678 --> 00:06:02.099
that simulation was originally developed

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:04.602
for studying the structure of DNA,

00:06:04.602 --> 00:06:08.589
and the visualization was done with a tool kit called Visit,

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:12.370
originally developed for physics simulations, interdisciplinary.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.753
Now, my assignment was to try and come up with a new way

00:06:15.753 --> 00:06:17.672
of looking at this, to make it optimal

00:06:17.672 --> 00:06:20.553
for the doctors and hospital; how can we make it

00:06:20.553 --> 00:06:22.916
the most efficient for them for a diagnosis.

00:06:22.916 --> 00:06:24.800
And I came up with this image.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.681
It is 2D, I took the whole artery and collapsed everything

00:06:28.681 --> 00:06:32.808
into a 2D plane. I got some very quizzical looks

00:06:32.808 --> 00:06:35.972
when I showed this to the doctors originally, but I was inspired to do

00:06:35.972 --> 00:06:37.968
this representation from my astronomy work,

00:06:37.968 --> 00:06:40.994
where we've been using these tree diagrams along the bottom

00:06:40.994 --> 00:06:43.997
to understand the structure of Nebulae.

00:06:43.997 --> 00:06:45.394
Well, we were inspired in that work

00:06:45.394 --> 00:06:47.417
from the bio informatics and genome community,

00:06:47.417 --> 00:06:49.740
where they use this tree diagrams to understand

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.163
their gene expression data.

00:06:51.163 --> 00:06:53.753
They were inspired by the evolutionary biologists,

00:06:53.753 --> 00:06:56.063
who use these tree diagrams to understand

00:06:56.063 --> 00:06:58.222
how species evolve, how they're related,

00:06:58.222 --> 00:07:00.950
the first of which was drawn by Sir Charles Darwin,

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.143
and here's an example from his 'Origin of the Species'.

00:07:04.143 --> 00:07:07.178
So, straight from Darwin through biology, physics,

00:07:07.178 --> 00:07:11.580
astronomy, back to medical imaging. Interdisciplinary.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.597
One may say, well, is this 2D representation better?

00:07:15.597 --> 00:07:17.897
A study of Harvard Medical School

00:07:17.897 --> 00:07:19.839
aimed to answer that one question.

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:23.803
And it turns out if you present the image on the left,

00:07:23.803 --> 00:07:27.112
to a doctor, on average they find about 39%

00:07:27.112 --> 00:07:28.801
of the high risk regions

00:07:28.801 --> 00:07:31.760
that could explode or block your heart and kill you.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.655
On the right, we can do a little better,

00:07:34.655 --> 00:07:38.599
and they're able to find 62% of these high-risk dangerous regions.

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:40.922
But we can do even better,

00:07:40.922 --> 00:07:43.564
simply by changing the colors.

00:07:43.564 --> 00:07:47.001
So, the rainbow color map is the sin most doctors and astronomers

00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:50.505
and physicists are guilty of using,

00:07:50.505 --> 00:07:55.342
and it doesn't focus on the best qualities of your visual system.

00:07:55.342 --> 00:07:58.396
Human system can see brightness variation, contrast,

00:07:58.396 --> 00:08:01.705
not really good at that whole red-green-yellow-blue thing.

00:08:01.705 --> 00:08:04.798
But now, if you look at shades of red and highlight

00:08:04.798 --> 00:08:07.504
the regions that are most diseased with dark red,

00:08:07.504 --> 00:08:11.256
now doctors can find 91% of the high-risk regions,

00:08:11.256 --> 00:08:16.427
simply by changing the colors. (Applause)

00:08:16.427 --> 00:08:18.920
And I would never known the importance of color,

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.853
if it was not for my computer science and visualization collaborators

00:08:21.853 --> 00:08:24.250
showing this to me; so, again,

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.770
interdisciplinary collaboration.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.501
Now, how do you even get a collaboration like this?

00:08:28.501 --> 00:08:30.667
In the case of astronomical medicine,

00:08:30.667 --> 00:08:33.733
it started with a Harvard Astronomy professor, Alyssa Goodman,

00:08:33.733 --> 00:08:37.056
serendipitously meeting a computer scientist

00:08:37.056 --> 00:08:39.914
and imaging specialist from Brigham and Woman’s Hospital,

00:08:39.914 --> 00:08:42.131
and their recruitment of a very adventurous,

00:08:42.131 --> 00:08:44.510
open-minded, young students.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:48.157
And from there, it has exploded and we've pulled in cardiologists,

00:08:48.157 --> 00:08:50.445
and computer scientists, and radiologists,

00:08:50.445 --> 00:08:55.205
and astronomers, physicists, chemists, computational physicists,

00:08:55.205 --> 00:08:57.117
I mean, we've brought so many people together,

00:08:57.117 --> 00:09:00.468
and it's been enlightening to share domains

00:09:00.468 --> 00:09:02.979
and information across borders.

00:09:02.979 --> 00:09:04.515
And we're still going and although

00:09:04.515 --> 00:09:06.099
most of the people up on the screen

00:09:06.099 --> 00:09:08.018
are from Harvard and Harvard Med,

00:09:08.018 --> 00:09:12.191
now we cross different institutions and continents to work together.

00:09:12.191 --> 00:09:14.519
And all I can say is, it's been wonderful,

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:16.646
we're continuing to make new discoveries.

00:09:16.646 --> 00:09:18.713
And I just urge you,

00:09:18.713 --> 00:09:21.400
attend conferences not in your own domain,

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.914
read books and journals not in your own discipline,

00:09:23.914 --> 00:09:27.047
watch TED talks and come to events like this,

00:09:27.047 --> 00:09:29.227
and say hi to the neighbor sitting next to you,

00:09:29.227 --> 00:09:31.483
'cos you really never know

00:09:31.483 --> 00:09:34.382
where your next great idea is gonna come from.

00:09:34.382 --> 00:09:36.366
Thank you.

00:09:36.366 --> 00:09:39.280
(Applause)
