00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:18.087
Bryn Freedman: You're a guy whose company
funds these AI programs and invests.

00:00:18.111 --> 00:00:23.156
So why should we trust you
to not have a bias

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.356
and tell us something really useful
for the rest of us

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.684
about the future of work?

00:00:29.046 --> 00:00:30.537
Roy Bahat: Yes, I am.

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:33.549
And when you wake up in the morning
and you read the newspaper

00:00:33.573 --> 00:00:37.022
and it says, "The robots are coming,
they may take all our jobs,"

00:00:37.046 --> 00:00:39.577
as a start-up investor
focused on the future of work,

00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:41.918
our fund was the first one to say

00:00:41.942 --> 00:00:44.252
artificial intelligence
should be a focus for us.

00:00:44.276 --> 00:00:46.529
So I woke up one morning
and read that and said,

00:00:46.553 --> 00:00:50.000
"Oh, my gosh, they're talking about me.
That's me who's doing that."

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:52.863
And then I thought: wait a minute.

00:00:52.887 --> 00:00:55.299
If things continue,

00:00:55.323 --> 00:01:00.577
then maybe not only will the start-ups
in which we invest struggle

00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:03.162
because there won't be people to have jobs

00:01:03.186 --> 00:01:06.048
to pay for the things
that they make and buy them,

00:01:06.072 --> 00:01:08.989
but our economy and society
might struggle, too.

00:01:09.013 --> 00:01:12.234
And look, I should be the guy
who sits here and tells you,

00:01:12.258 --> 00:01:15.389
"Everything is going to be fine.
It's all going to work out great.

00:01:15.413 --> 00:01:17.445
Hey, when they introduced the ATM machine,

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:19.605
years later, there's more
tellers in banks."

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:20.787
It's true.

00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:24.127
And yet, when I looked at it, I thought,
"This is going to accelerate.

00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:27.411
And if it does accelerate,
there's a chance the center doesn't hold."

00:01:27.435 --> 00:01:29.918
But I figured somebody must know
the answer to this;

00:01:29.942 --> 00:01:31.617
there are so many ideas out there.

00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:34.695
And I read all the books,
and I went to the conferences,

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:40.363
and at one point, we counted more than
100 efforts to study the future of work.

00:01:40.387 --> 00:01:43.244
And it was a frustrating experience,

00:01:43.268 --> 00:01:47.283
because I'd hear the same back-and-forth
over and over again:

00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:49.085
"The robots are coming!"

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.712
And then somebody else would say,

00:01:50.736 --> 00:01:54.300
"Oh, don't worry about that, they've
always said that and it turns out OK."

00:01:54.324 --> 00:01:55.713
Then somebody else would say,

00:01:55.737 --> 00:01:58.469
"Well, it's really about the meaning
of your job, anyway."

00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:01.276
And then everybody would shrug
and go off and have a drink.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.402
And it felt like there was this
Kabuki theater of this discussion,

00:02:04.426 --> 00:02:06.301
where nobody was talking to each other.

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:09.811
And many of the people that I knew
and worked with in the technology world

00:02:09.835 --> 00:02:11.510
were not speaking to policy makers;

00:02:11.534 --> 00:02:13.603
the policy makers
were not speaking to them.

00:02:13.627 --> 00:02:17.809
And so we partnered with a nonpartisan
think tank NGO called New America

00:02:17.833 --> 00:02:19.166
to study this issue.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.538
And we brought together a group of people,

00:02:21.562 --> 00:02:24.992
including an AI czar
at a technology company

00:02:25.016 --> 00:02:26.888
and a video game designer

00:02:26.912 --> 00:02:28.395
and a heartland conservative

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:29.663
and a Wall Street investor

00:02:29.687 --> 00:02:31.647
and a socialist magazine editor --

00:02:31.671 --> 00:02:34.639
literally, all in the same room;
it was occasionally awkward --

00:02:34.663 --> 00:02:37.244
to try to figure out
what is it that will happen here.

00:02:37.268 --> 00:02:40.088
The question we asked was simple.

00:02:40.704 --> 00:02:44.117
It was: What is the effect of technology
on work going to be?

00:02:44.141 --> 00:02:45.768
And we looked out 10 to 20 years,

00:02:45.792 --> 00:02:49.276
because we wanted to look out far enough
that there could be real change,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.269
but soon enough that we weren't talking
about teleportation or anything like that.

00:02:53.293 --> 00:02:54.671
And we recognized --

00:02:54.695 --> 00:02:57.744
and I think every year
we're reminded of this in the world --

00:02:57.768 --> 00:02:59.975
that predicting what's
going to happen is hard.

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:02.855
So instead of predicting,
there are other things you can do.

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.675
You can try to imagine
alternate possible futures,

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:06.851
which is what we did.

00:03:06.875 --> 00:03:08.633
We did a scenario-planning exercise,

00:03:08.657 --> 00:03:11.723
and we imagined cases
where no job is safe.

00:03:11.747 --> 00:03:14.850
We imagined cases where every job is safe.

00:03:14.874 --> 00:03:18.913
And we imagined every
distinct possibility we could.

00:03:18.937 --> 00:03:22.220
And the result, which really surprised us,

00:03:22.244 --> 00:03:25.942
was when you think through those futures
and you think what should we do,

00:03:25.966 --> 00:03:29.881
the answers about what we should do
actually turn out to be the same,

00:03:29.905 --> 00:03:31.401
no matter what happens.

00:03:31.425 --> 00:03:35.167
And the irony of looking out
10 to 20 years into the future is,

00:03:35.191 --> 00:03:37.600
you realize that the things
we want to act on

00:03:37.624 --> 00:03:39.585
are actually already happening right now.

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.395
The automation is right now,
the future is right now.

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:45.014
BF: So what does that mean,
and what does that tell us?

00:03:45.038 --> 00:03:47.736
If the future is now, what is it
that we should be doing,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.630
and what should we be thinking about?

00:03:49.654 --> 00:03:51.734
RB: We have to understand
the problem first.

00:03:51.758 --> 00:03:55.797
And so the data are that as the economy
becomes more productive

00:03:55.821 --> 00:03:57.966
and individual workers
become more productive,

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.252
their wages haven't risen.

00:03:59.276 --> 00:04:02.466
If you look at the proportion
of prime working-age men,

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.982
in the United States at least,

00:04:04.006 --> 00:04:07.755
who work now versus in 1960,

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:10.247
we have three times
as many men not working.

00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:11.715
And then you hear the stories.

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.178
I sat down with a group
of Walmart workers and said,

00:04:14.202 --> 00:04:17.845
"What do you think about this cashier,
this futuristic self-checkout thing?"

00:04:17.869 --> 00:04:21.074
They said, "That's nice, but have
you heard about the cash recycler?

00:04:21.098 --> 00:04:23.471
That's a machine that's being
installed right now,

00:04:23.495 --> 00:04:26.132
and is eliminating two jobs
at every Walmart right now."

00:04:26.156 --> 00:04:29.199
And so we just thought, "Geez. We don't
understand the problem."

00:04:29.223 --> 00:04:32.501
And so we looked at the voices
that were the ones that were excluded,

00:04:32.525 --> 00:04:35.125
which is all of the people
affected by this change.

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:36.736
And we decided to listen to them,

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.744
sort of "automation and its discontents."

00:04:38.768 --> 00:04:41.171
And I've spent the last
couple of years doing that.

00:04:41.195 --> 00:04:43.591
I've been to Flint, Michigan,
and Youngstown, Ohio,

00:04:43.615 --> 00:04:46.046
talking about entrepreneurs,
trying to make it work

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.018
in a very different environment
from New York or San Francisco

00:04:49.042 --> 00:04:50.527
or London or Tokyo.

00:04:50.551 --> 00:04:52.148
I've been to prisons twice

00:04:52.172 --> 00:04:55.053
to talk to inmates about
their jobs after they leave.

00:04:55.077 --> 00:04:58.824
I've sat down with truck drivers
to ask them about the self-driving truck,

00:04:58.848 --> 00:05:01.302
with people who, in addition
to their full-time job,

00:05:01.326 --> 00:05:03.110
care for an aging relative.

00:05:03.134 --> 00:05:04.698
And when you talk to people,

00:05:04.722 --> 00:05:07.673
there were two themes
that came out loud and clear.

00:05:08.285 --> 00:05:13.129
The first one was that people
are less looking for more money

00:05:13.153 --> 00:05:16.431
or get out of the fear
of the robot taking their job,

00:05:16.455 --> 00:05:18.351
and they just want something stable.

00:05:18.375 --> 00:05:19.915
They want something predictable.

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:23.614
So if you survey people and ask them
what they want out of work,

00:05:23.638 --> 00:05:27.118
for everybody who makes
less than 150,000 dollars a year,

00:05:27.142 --> 00:05:30.498
they'll take a more stable
and secure income, on average,

00:05:30.522 --> 00:05:32.387
over earning more money.

00:05:32.411 --> 00:05:34.625
And if you think about the fact that

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:38.037
not only for all of the people
across the earth who don't earn a living,

00:05:38.061 --> 00:05:39.252
but for those who do,

00:05:39.276 --> 00:05:42.236
the vast majority earn a different
amount from month to month

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.474
and have an instability,

00:05:43.498 --> 00:05:44.895
all of a sudden you realize,

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.417
"Wait a minute. We have
a real problem on our hands."

00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:51.164
And the second thing they say,
which took us a longer time to understand,

00:05:51.188 --> 00:05:53.566
is they say they want dignity.

00:05:53.894 --> 00:05:59.006
And that concept
of self-worth through work

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.641
emerged again and again and again
in our conversations.

00:06:01.665 --> 00:06:04.649
BF: So, I certainly
appreciate this answer.

00:06:04.673 --> 00:06:06.144
But you can't eat dignity,

00:06:06.168 --> 00:06:09.053
you can't clothe your children
with self-esteem.

00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:12.565
So, what is that, how do you reconcile --

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:14.430
what does dignity mean,

00:06:14.454 --> 00:06:18.117
and what is the relationship
between dignity and stability?

00:06:18.141 --> 00:06:20.625
RB: You can't eat dignity.
You need stability first.

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:21.887
And the good news is,

00:06:21.911 --> 00:06:24.666
many of the conversations
that are happening right now

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.252
are about how we solve that.

00:06:26.276 --> 00:06:30.141
You know, I'm a proponent
of studying guaranteed income,

00:06:30.165 --> 00:06:31.442
as one example,

00:06:31.466 --> 00:06:33.754
conversations about how
health care gets provided

00:06:33.778 --> 00:06:35.017
and other benefits.

00:06:35.041 --> 00:06:36.818
Those conversations are happening,

00:06:36.842 --> 00:06:39.238
and we're at a time
where we must figure that out.

00:06:39.262 --> 00:06:40.903
It is the crisis of our era.

00:06:40.927 --> 00:06:43.839
And my point of view
after talking to people

00:06:43.863 --> 00:06:45.903
is that we may do that,

00:06:45.927 --> 00:06:47.507
and it still might not be enough.

00:06:47.531 --> 00:06:50.338
Because what we need to do
from the beginning is understand

00:06:50.362 --> 00:06:52.602
what is it about work
that gives people dignity,

00:06:52.626 --> 00:06:55.966
so they can live the lives
that they want to live.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.005
And so that concept of dignity is ...

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:01.961
it's difficult to get your hands around,

00:07:01.985 --> 00:07:05.584
because when many people hear it --
especially, to be honest, rich people --

00:07:05.608 --> 00:07:06.764
they hear "meaning."

00:07:06.788 --> 00:07:08.694
They hear "My work is important to me."

00:07:08.718 --> 00:07:12.355
And again, if you survey people
and you ask them,

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:15.879
"How important is it to you
that your work be important to you?"

00:07:15.903 --> 00:07:19.204
only people who make
150,000 dollars a year or more

00:07:19.228 --> 00:07:23.451
say that it is important to them
that their work be important.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.275
BF: Meaning, meaningful?

00:07:25.744 --> 00:07:28.621
RB: Just defined as,
"Is your work important to you?"

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.666
Whatever somebody took that to mean.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.604
And yet, of course dignity is essential.

00:07:33.628 --> 00:07:35.348
We talked to truck drivers who said,

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:39.336
"I saw my cousin drive, and I got
on the open road and it was amazing.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.430
And I started making more money
than people who went to college."

00:07:42.454 --> 00:07:45.628
Then they'd get to the end
of their thought and say something like,

00:07:45.652 --> 00:07:48.297
"People need their fruits
and vegetables in the morning,

00:07:48.321 --> 00:07:50.120
and I'm the guy who gets it to them."

00:07:50.144 --> 00:07:53.684
We talked to somebody who, in addition
to his job, was caring for his aunt.

00:07:53.708 --> 00:07:55.207
He was making plenty of money.

00:07:55.231 --> 00:07:56.548
At one point we just asked,

00:07:56.572 --> 00:08:00.834
"What is it about caring for your aunt?
Can't you just pay somebody to do it?"

00:08:00.858 --> 00:08:03.351
He said, "My aunt doesn't want
somebody we pay for.

00:08:03.375 --> 00:08:04.577
My aunt wants me."

00:08:04.601 --> 00:08:08.268
So there was this concept there
of being needed.

00:08:08.292 --> 00:08:10.749
If you study the word
"dignity," it's fascinating.

00:08:10.773 --> 00:08:14.048
It's one of the oldest words
in the English language, from antiquity.

00:08:14.072 --> 00:08:15.224
And it has two meanings:

00:08:15.248 --> 00:08:16.402
one is self-worth,

00:08:16.426 --> 00:08:20.653
and the other is that something
is suitable, it's fitting,

00:08:20.677 --> 00:08:23.535
meaning that you're part
of something greater than yourself,

00:08:23.559 --> 00:08:25.382
and it connects to some broader whole.

00:08:25.406 --> 00:08:27.123
In other words, that you're needed.

00:08:27.147 --> 00:08:29.021
BF: So how do you answer this question,

00:08:29.045 --> 00:08:31.095
this concept that we don't pay teachers,

00:08:31.119 --> 00:08:33.387
and we don't pay eldercare workers,

00:08:33.411 --> 00:08:36.537
and we don't pay people
who really care for people

00:08:36.561 --> 00:08:38.847
and are needed, enough?

00:08:38.871 --> 00:08:42.053
RB: Well, the good news is,
people are finally asking the question.

00:08:42.077 --> 00:08:44.380
So as AI investors,
we often get phone calls

00:08:44.404 --> 00:08:47.134
from foundations or CEOs
and boardrooms saying,

00:08:47.158 --> 00:08:48.463
"What do we do about this?"

00:08:48.487 --> 00:08:49.796
And they used to be asking,

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.932
"What do we do about
introducing automation?"

00:08:51.956 --> 00:08:54.654
And now they're asking,
"What do we do about self-worth?"

00:08:54.678 --> 00:08:57.101
And they know that the employees
who work for them

00:08:57.125 --> 00:08:59.371
who have a spouse who cares for somebody,

00:08:59.395 --> 00:09:02.918
that dignity is essential
to their ability to just do their job.

00:09:02.942 --> 00:09:04.718
I think there's two kinds of answers:

00:09:04.742 --> 00:09:07.268
there's the money side
of just making your life work.

00:09:07.292 --> 00:09:09.617
That's stability. You need to eat.

00:09:09.641 --> 00:09:11.978
And then you think about
our culture more broadly,

00:09:12.002 --> 00:09:14.680
and you ask: Who do we make into heroes?

00:09:14.704 --> 00:09:19.164
And, you know, what I want
is to see the magazine cover

00:09:19.188 --> 00:09:21.940
that is the person
who is the heroic caregiver.

00:09:22.292 --> 00:09:25.022
Or the Netflix series
that dramatizes the person

00:09:25.046 --> 00:09:28.283
who makes all of our other lives work
so we can do the things we do.

00:09:28.307 --> 00:09:30.130
Let's make heroes out of those people.

00:09:30.154 --> 00:09:32.187
That's the Netflix show
that I would binge.

00:09:32.211 --> 00:09:34.490
And we've had chroniclers
of this before --

00:09:34.514 --> 00:09:35.728
Studs Terkel,

00:09:35.752 --> 00:09:39.458
the oral history of the working
experience in the United States.

00:09:39.482 --> 00:09:42.634
And what we need is the experience
of needing one another

00:09:42.658 --> 00:09:44.283
and being connected to each other.

00:09:44.307 --> 00:09:47.347
Maybe that's the answer
for how we all fit as a society.

00:09:47.371 --> 00:09:49.093
And the thought exercise, to me, is:

00:09:49.117 --> 00:09:51.695
if you were to go back 100 years
and have people --

00:09:51.719 --> 00:09:55.490
my grandparents, great-grandparents,
a tailor, worked in a mine --

00:09:55.514 --> 00:09:59.339
they look at what all of us do
for a living and say, "That's not work."

00:09:59.363 --> 00:10:03.132
We sit there and type and talk,
and there's no danger of getting hurt.

00:10:03.526 --> 00:10:07.017
And my guess is that if you were
to imagine 100 years from now,

00:10:07.041 --> 00:10:09.053
we'll still be doing things
for each other.

00:10:09.077 --> 00:10:10.483
We'll still need one another.

00:10:10.507 --> 00:10:12.514
And we just will think of it as work.

00:10:12.538 --> 00:10:14.212
The entire thing I'm trying to say

00:10:14.236 --> 00:10:17.109
is that dignity should not
just be about having a job.

00:10:17.133 --> 00:10:19.990
Because if you say
you need a job to have dignity,

00:10:20.014 --> 00:10:21.458
which many people say,

00:10:21.482 --> 00:10:24.299
the second you say that,
you say to all the parents

00:10:24.323 --> 00:10:26.768
and all the teachers
and all the caregivers

00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:27.966
that all of a sudden,

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.537
because they're not being paid
for what they're doing,

00:10:30.561 --> 00:10:32.854
it somehow lacks this
essential human quality.

00:10:32.878 --> 00:10:34.982
To me, that's the great
puzzle of our time:

00:10:35.006 --> 00:10:38.117
Can we figure out how to provide
that stability throughout life,

00:10:38.141 --> 00:10:40.674
and then can we figure out
how to create an inclusive,

00:10:40.698 --> 00:10:44.965
not just racially, gender,
but multigenerationally inclusive --

00:10:44.989 --> 00:10:49.868
I mean, every different
human experience included --

00:10:49.892 --> 00:10:53.095
in this way of understanding
how we can be needed by one another.

00:10:53.119 --> 00:10:54.485
BF: Thank you.
RB: Thank you.

00:10:54.509 --> 00:10:56.706
BF: Thank you very much
for your participation.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:57.880
(Applause)
