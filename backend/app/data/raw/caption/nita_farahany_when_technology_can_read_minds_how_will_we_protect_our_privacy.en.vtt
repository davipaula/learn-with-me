00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:17.810
In the months following
the 2009 presidential election in Iran,

00:00:17.834 --> 00:00:20.728
protests erupted across the country.

00:00:21.685 --> 00:00:24.581
The Iranian government
violently suppressed

00:00:24.605 --> 00:00:28.584
what came to be known
as the Iranian Green Movement,

00:00:28.608 --> 00:00:30.661
even blocking mobile signals

00:00:30.685 --> 00:00:33.399
to cut off communication
between the protesters.

00:00:34.316 --> 00:00:38.985
My parents, who emigrated
to the United States in the late 1960s,

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:40.803
spend substantial time there,

00:00:40.827 --> 00:00:43.980
where all of my large,
extended family live.

00:00:44.832 --> 00:00:47.961
When I would call my family in Tehran

00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:51.437
during some of the most violent
crackdowns of the protest,

00:00:51.461 --> 00:00:54.713
none of them dared discuss
with me what was happening.

00:00:55.196 --> 00:00:58.725
They or I knew to quickly steer
the conversation to other topics.

00:00:59.163 --> 00:01:02.543
All of us understood
what the consequences could be

00:01:02.567 --> 00:01:05.107
of a perceived dissident action.

00:01:06.095 --> 00:01:09.564
But I still wish I could have known
what they were thinking

00:01:09.588 --> 00:01:11.006
or what they were feeling.

00:01:12.217 --> 00:01:13.610
What if I could have?

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:15.300
Or more frighteningly,

00:01:15.324 --> 00:01:18.085
what if the Iranian government could have?

00:01:18.695 --> 00:01:21.939
Would they have arrested them
based on what their brains revealed?

00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:25.877
That day may be closer than you think.

00:01:26.527 --> 00:01:30.338
With our growing capabilities
in neuroscience, artificial intelligence

00:01:30.362 --> 00:01:32.065
and machine learning,

00:01:32.089 --> 00:01:36.164
we may soon know a lot more
of what's happening in the human brain.

00:01:37.083 --> 00:01:40.393
As a bioethicist, a lawyer, a philosopher

00:01:40.417 --> 00:01:42.284
and an Iranian-American,

00:01:42.308 --> 00:01:46.095
I'm deeply concerned
about what this means for our freedoms

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.290
and what kinds of protections we need.

00:01:48.993 --> 00:01:52.453
I believe we need
a right to cognitive liberty,

00:01:52.477 --> 00:01:55.369
as a human right
that needs to be protected.

00:01:55.772 --> 00:01:58.415
If not, our freedom of thought,

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.463
access and control over our own brains

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:04.328
and our mental privacy will be threatened.

00:02:05.698 --> 00:02:06.856
Consider this:

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.194
the average person thinks
thousands of thoughts each day.

00:02:10.697 --> 00:02:11.848
As a thought takes form,

00:02:11.872 --> 00:02:16.928
like a math calculation
or a number, a word,

00:02:16.952 --> 00:02:19.837
neurons are interacting in the brain,

00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:22.949
creating a miniscule electrical discharge.

00:02:23.713 --> 00:02:27.165
When you have a dominant
mental state, like relaxation,

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:31.364
hundreds and thousands of neurons
are firing in the brain,

00:02:31.388 --> 00:02:35.606
creating concurrent electrical discharges
in characteristic patterns

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.495
that can be measured
with electroencephalography, or EEG.

00:02:41.118 --> 00:02:43.278
In fact, that's what
you're seeing right now.

00:02:43.956 --> 00:02:47.920
You're seeing my brain activity
that was recorded in real time

00:02:47.944 --> 00:02:50.679
with a simple device
that was worn on my head.

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:57.322
What you're seeing is my brain activity
when I was relaxed and curious.

00:02:58.097 --> 00:02:59.852
To share this information with you,

00:02:59.876 --> 00:03:02.896
I wore one of the early
consumer-based EEG devices

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.131
like this one,

00:03:04.155 --> 00:03:08.143
which recorded the electrical
activity in my brain in real time.

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.675
It's not unlike the fitness trackers
that some of you may be wearing

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:16.285
to measure your heart rate
or the steps that you've taken,

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:17.896
or even your sleep activity.

00:03:19.154 --> 00:03:22.978
It's hardly the most sophisticated
neuroimaging technique on the market.

00:03:23.597 --> 00:03:25.975
But it's already the most portable

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:29.151
and the most likely to impact
our everyday lives.

00:03:29.915 --> 00:03:31.418
This is extraordinary.

00:03:31.442 --> 00:03:33.947
Through a simple, wearable device,

00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:37.519
we can literally see
inside the human brain

00:03:37.543 --> 00:03:44.019
and learn aspects of our mental landscape
without ever uttering a word.

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.482
While we can't reliably decode
complex thoughts just yet,

00:03:48.506 --> 00:03:51.025
we can already gauge a person's mood,

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.922
and with the help
of artificial intelligence,

00:03:53.946 --> 00:03:58.287
we can even decode
some single-digit numbers

00:03:58.311 --> 00:04:03.193
or shapes or simple words
that a person is thinking

00:04:03.217 --> 00:04:05.406
or hearing, or seeing.

00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:09.710
Despite some inherent limitations in EEG,

00:04:09.734 --> 00:04:14.454
I think it's safe to say
that with our advances in technology,

00:04:14.478 --> 00:04:18.287
more and more of what's happening
in the human brain

00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:20.621
can and will be decoded over time.

00:04:21.362 --> 00:04:24.108
Already, using one of these devices,

00:04:24.132 --> 00:04:27.387
an epileptic can know
they're going to have an epileptic seizure

00:04:27.411 --> 00:04:28.847
before it happens.

00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:33.474
A paraplegic can type on a computer
with their thoughts alone.

00:04:34.485 --> 00:04:38.668
A US-based company has developed
a technology to embed these sensors

00:04:38.692 --> 00:04:40.922
into the headrest of automobilies

00:04:40.946 --> 00:04:43.451
so they can track driver concentration,

00:04:43.475 --> 00:04:46.142
distraction and cognitive load
while driving.

00:04:46.912 --> 00:04:50.970
Nissan, insurance companies
and AAA have all taken note.

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:56.457
You could even watch this
choose-your-own-adventure movie

00:04:56.481 --> 00:05:00.721
"The Moment," which, with an EEG headset,

00:05:00.745 --> 00:05:04.671
changes the movie
based on your brain-based reactions,

00:05:04.695 --> 00:05:09.048
giving you a different ending
every time your attention wanes.

00:05:11.154 --> 00:05:13.917
This may all sound great,

00:05:13.941 --> 00:05:16.130
and as a bioethicist,

00:05:16.154 --> 00:05:19.767
I am a huge proponent of empowering people

00:05:19.791 --> 00:05:22.407
to take charge of their own
health and well-being

00:05:22.431 --> 00:05:25.349
by giving them access
to information about themselves,

00:05:25.373 --> 00:05:28.349
including this incredible
new brain-decoding technology.

00:05:29.878 --> 00:05:31.045
But I worry.

00:05:31.736 --> 00:05:36.496
I worry that we will voluntarily
or involuntarily give up

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.638
our last bastion of freedom,
our mental privacy.

00:05:41.302 --> 00:05:44.227
That we will trade our brain activity

00:05:44.251 --> 00:05:47.297
for rebates or discounts on insurance,

00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:50.994
or free access
to social-media accounts ...

00:05:52.444 --> 00:05:54.292
or even to keep our jobs.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.813
In fact, in China,

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:04.096
the train drivers on
the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail,

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.652
the busiest of its kind in the world,

00:06:06.676 --> 00:06:09.152
are required to wear EEG devices

00:06:09.176 --> 00:06:11.603
to monitor their brain activity
while driving.

00:06:12.157 --> 00:06:14.383
According to some news sources,

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:17.086
in government-run factories in China,

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:22.474
the workers are required to wear
EEG sensors to monitor their productivity

00:06:22.498 --> 00:06:24.613
and their emotional state at work.

00:06:25.267 --> 00:06:27.577
Workers are even sent home

00:06:27.601 --> 00:06:31.655
if their brains show less-than-stellar
concentration on their jobs,

00:06:31.679 --> 00:06:33.801
or emotional agitation.

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:36.934
It's not going to happen tomorrow,

00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:40.044
but we're headed to a world
of brain transparency.

00:06:40.537 --> 00:06:43.977
And I don't think people understand
that that could change everything.

00:06:44.474 --> 00:06:48.149
Everything from our definitions
of data privacy to our laws,

00:06:48.173 --> 00:06:49.973
to our ideas about freedom.

00:06:50.731 --> 00:06:53.808
In fact, in my lab at Duke University,

00:06:53.832 --> 00:06:57.007
we recently conducted a nationwide study
in the United States

00:06:57.031 --> 00:06:58.990
to see if people appreciated

00:06:59.014 --> 00:07:01.085
the sensitivity
of their brain information.

00:07:02.356 --> 00:07:05.712
We asked people to rate
their perceived sensitivity

00:07:05.736 --> 00:07:07.967
of 33 different kinds of information,

00:07:07.991 --> 00:07:10.211
from their social security numbers

00:07:10.235 --> 00:07:12.832
to the content
of their phone conversations,

00:07:12.856 --> 00:07:15.049
their relationship history,

00:07:15.073 --> 00:07:17.015
their emotions, their anxiety,

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:18.985
the mental images in their mind

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:20.547
and the thoughts in their mind.

00:07:21.481 --> 00:07:26.710
Shockingly, people rated their social
security number as far more sensitive

00:07:26.734 --> 00:07:28.937
than any other kind of information,

00:07:28.961 --> 00:07:31.396
including their brain data.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.596
I think this is because
people don't yet understand

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.683
or believe the implications
of this new brain-decoding technology.

00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:43.918
After all, if we can know
the inner workings of the human brain,

00:07:43.942 --> 00:07:46.648
our social security numbers
are the least of our worries.

00:07:46.672 --> 00:07:47.957
(Laughter)

00:07:47.981 --> 00:07:49.148
Think about it.

00:07:49.172 --> 00:07:51.568
In a world of total brain transparency,

00:07:51.592 --> 00:07:54.021
who would dare have
a politically dissident thought?

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:56.820
Or a creative one?

00:07:57.503 --> 00:08:00.979
I worry that people will self-censor

00:08:01.003 --> 00:08:04.305
in fear of being ostracized by society,

00:08:04.329 --> 00:08:08.142
or that people will lose their jobs
because of their waning attention

00:08:08.166 --> 00:08:10.316
or emotional instability,

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.890
or because they're contemplating
collective action against their employers.

00:08:14.478 --> 00:08:17.655
That coming out
will no longer be an option,

00:08:17.679 --> 00:08:22.746
because people's brains will long ago
have revealed their sexual orientation,

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.592
their political ideology

00:08:24.616 --> 00:08:26.641
or their religious preferences,

00:08:26.665 --> 00:08:29.745
well before they were ready
to consciously share that information

00:08:29.769 --> 00:08:31.022
with other people.

00:08:31.565 --> 00:08:36.477
I worry about the ability of our laws
to keep up with technological change.

00:08:36.986 --> 00:08:39.306
Take the First Amendment
of the US Constitution,

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.288
which protects freedom of speech.

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:43.239
Does it also protect freedom of thought?

00:08:43.944 --> 00:08:48.113
And if so, does that mean that we're free
to alter our thoughts however we want?

00:08:48.137 --> 00:08:52.811
Or can the government or society tell us
what we can do with our own brains?

00:08:53.591 --> 00:08:57.308
Can the NSA spy on our brains
using these new mobile devices?

00:08:58.053 --> 00:09:02.172
Can the companies that collect
the brain data through their applications

00:09:02.196 --> 00:09:04.270
sell this information to third parties?

00:09:05.174 --> 00:09:08.396
Right now, no laws prevent them
from doing so.

00:09:09.203 --> 00:09:11.228
It could be even more problematic

00:09:11.252 --> 00:09:13.771
in countries that don't share
the same freedoms

00:09:13.795 --> 00:09:15.898
enjoyed by people in the United States.

00:09:16.883 --> 00:09:20.670
What would've happened during
the Iranian Green Movement

00:09:20.694 --> 00:09:24.595
if the government had been
monitoring my family's brain activity,

00:09:24.619 --> 00:09:28.626
and had believed them
to be sympathetic to the protesters?

00:09:30.091 --> 00:09:33.138
Is it so far-fetched to imagine a society

00:09:33.162 --> 00:09:36.004
in which people are arrested
based on their thoughts

00:09:36.028 --> 00:09:37.195
of committing a crime,

00:09:37.219 --> 00:09:41.531
like in the science-fiction
dystopian society in "Minority Report."

00:09:42.286 --> 00:09:46.609
Already, in the United States, in Indiana,

00:09:46.633 --> 00:09:51.570
an 18-year-old was charged
with attempting to intimidate his school

00:09:51.594 --> 00:09:54.903
by posting a video of himself
shooting people in the hallways ...

00:09:55.881 --> 00:09:58.888
Except the people were zombies

00:09:58.912 --> 00:10:03.959
and the video was of him playing
an augmented-reality video game,

00:10:03.983 --> 00:10:08.755
all interpreted to be a mental projection
of his subjective intent.

00:10:10.456 --> 00:10:15.068
This is exactly why our brains
need special protection.

00:10:15.092 --> 00:10:18.648
If our brains are just as subject
to data tracking and aggregation

00:10:18.672 --> 00:10:21.204
as our financial records and transactions,

00:10:21.228 --> 00:10:25.513
if our brains can be hacked
and tracked like our online activities,

00:10:25.537 --> 00:10:27.898
our mobile phones and applications,

00:10:27.922 --> 00:10:32.191
then we're on the brink of a dangerous
threat to our collective humanity.

00:10:33.406 --> 00:10:34.715
Before you panic,

00:10:36.012 --> 00:10:39.156
I believe that there are solutions
to these concerns,

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.005
but we have to start by focusing
on the right things.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.501
When it comes to privacy
protections in general,

00:10:45.525 --> 00:10:47.351
I think we're fighting a losing battle

00:10:47.375 --> 00:10:50.233
by trying to restrict
the flow of information.

00:10:50.257 --> 00:10:54.314
Instead, we should be focusing
on securing rights and remedies

00:10:54.338 --> 00:10:56.613
against the misuse of our information.

00:10:57.291 --> 00:11:00.576
If people had the right to decide
how their information was shared,

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.521
and more importantly, have legal redress

00:11:03.545 --> 00:11:05.973
if their information
was misused against them,

00:11:05.997 --> 00:11:08.783
say to discriminate against them
in an employment setting

00:11:08.807 --> 00:11:11.592
or in health care or education,

00:11:11.616 --> 00:11:14.187
this would go a long way to build trust.

00:11:14.843 --> 00:11:16.561
In fact, in some instances,

00:11:16.585 --> 00:11:20.109
we want to be sharing more
of our personal information.

00:11:20.697 --> 00:11:23.744
Studying aggregated information
can tell us so much

00:11:23.768 --> 00:11:26.515
about our health and our well-being,

00:11:26.539 --> 00:11:29.852
but to be able to safely share
our information,

00:11:29.876 --> 00:11:33.099
we need special protections
for mental privacy.

00:11:33.832 --> 00:11:36.979
This is why we need
a right to cognitive liberty.

00:11:37.543 --> 00:11:41.622
This right would secure for us
our freedom of thought and rumination,

00:11:41.646 --> 00:11:44.186
our freedom of self-determination,

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:48.600
and it would insure that we have
the right to consent to or refuse

00:11:48.624 --> 00:11:51.481
access and alteration
of our brains by others.

00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:53.923
This right could be recognized

00:11:53.947 --> 00:11:56.830
as part of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights,

00:11:56.854 --> 00:11:59.242
which has established mechanisms

00:11:59.266 --> 00:12:02.122
for the enforcement
of these kinds of social rights.

00:12:03.872 --> 00:12:05.942
During the Iranian Green Movement,

00:12:05.966 --> 00:12:11.152
the protesters used the internet
and good old-fashioned word of mouth

00:12:11.176 --> 00:12:13.124
to coordinate their marches.

00:12:14.238 --> 00:12:17.007
And some of the most oppressive
restrictions in Iran

00:12:17.031 --> 00:12:18.908
were lifted as a result.

00:12:20.047 --> 00:12:24.134
But what if the Iranian government
had used brain surveillance

00:12:24.158 --> 00:12:27.219
to detect and prevent the protest?

00:12:28.847 --> 00:12:32.023
Would the world have ever heard
the protesters' cries?

00:12:33.732 --> 00:12:38.853
The time has come for us to call
for a cognitive liberty revolution.

00:12:39.559 --> 00:12:42.823
To make sure that we responsibly
advance technology

00:12:42.847 --> 00:12:45.825
that could enable us to embrace the future

00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:52.566
while fiercely protecting all of us
from any person, company or government

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:57.630
that attempts to unlawfully access
or alter our innermost lives.

00:12:58.659 --> 00:12:59.833
Thank you.

00:12:59.857 --> 00:13:03.349
(Applause)
