00:00:12.873 --> 00:00:14.295
Take a moment

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:15.835
and think about a virus.

00:00:16.913 --> 00:00:18.706
What comes to your mind?

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:19.983
An illness?

00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:21.333
A fear?

00:00:21.357 --> 00:00:23.363
Probably something really unpleasant.

00:00:23.387 --> 00:00:25.934
And yet, viruses are not all the same.

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:29.489
It's true, some of them cause
devastating disease.

00:00:29.513 --> 00:00:33.600
But others can do the exact opposite --
they can cure disease.

00:00:33.624 --> 00:00:35.656
These viruses are called "phages."

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:39.434
Now, the first time I heard
about phages was back in 2013.

00:00:39.458 --> 00:00:41.609
My father-in-law, who's a surgeon,

00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:44.053
was telling me about a woman
he was treating.

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:47.196
The woman had a knee injury,
required multiple surgeries,

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.673
and over the course of these,

00:00:48.697 --> 00:00:51.569
developed a chronic
bacterial infection in her leg.

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:52.853
Unfortunately for her,

00:00:52.877 --> 00:00:55.910
the bacteria causing the infection
also did not respond

00:00:55.934 --> 00:00:58.401
to any antibiotic that was available.

00:00:58.807 --> 00:01:02.196
So at this point, typically, the only
option left is to amputate the leg

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.632
to stop the infection
from spreading further.

00:01:05.268 --> 00:01:08.799
Now, my father-in-law was desperate
for a different kind of solution,

00:01:08.823 --> 00:01:13.325
and he applied for an experimental,
last-resort treatment using phages.

00:01:13.727 --> 00:01:15.593
And guess what? It worked.

00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:19.783
Within three weeks of applying the phages,
the chronic infection had healed up,

00:01:19.807 --> 00:01:22.474
where before, no antibiotic was working.

00:01:22.998 --> 00:01:26.913
I was fascinated by this weird conception:

00:01:27.522 --> 00:01:29.743
viruses curing an infection.

00:01:30.617 --> 00:01:34.093
To this day, I am fascinated
by the medical potential of phages.

00:01:34.117 --> 00:01:37.785
And I actually quit my job last year
to build a company in this space.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.160
Now, what is a phage?

00:01:41.465 --> 00:01:45.171
The image that you see here was taken
by an electron microscope.

00:01:45.195 --> 00:01:48.929
And that means what we see on the screen
is in reality extremely tiny.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.017
The grainy thing in the middle
with the head, the long body

00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:54.490
and a number of feet --

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:57.204
this is the image of a prototypical phage.

00:01:57.228 --> 00:01:58.450
It's kind of cute.

00:01:58.474 --> 00:02:00.029
(Laughter)

00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958
Now, take a look at your hand.

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.075
In our team, we've estimated
that you have more than 10 billion phages

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.566
on each of your hands.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.678
What are they doing there?

00:02:11.702 --> 00:02:12.950
(Laughter)

00:02:12.974 --> 00:02:15.768
Well, viruses are good at infecting cells.

00:02:15.792 --> 00:02:18.006
And phages are great
at infecting bacteria.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.458
And your hand, just like
so much of our body,

00:02:20.482 --> 00:02:22.918
is a hotbed of bacterial activity,

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:26.180
making it an ideal
hunting ground for phages.

00:02:26.204 --> 00:02:29.053
Because after all, phages hunt bacteria.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.486
It's also important to know that phages
are extremely selective hunters.

00:02:34.014 --> 00:02:37.947
Typically, a phage will only infect
a single bacterial species.

00:02:38.648 --> 00:02:41.640
So in this rendering here,
the phage that you see

00:02:41.664 --> 00:02:44.830
hunts for a bacterium
called Staphylococcus aureus,

00:02:44.854 --> 00:02:48.109
which is known as MRSA
in its drug-resistant form.

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:50.266
It causes skin or wound infections.

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.828
The way the phage hunts is with its feet.

00:02:54.364 --> 00:02:56.862
The feet are actually extremely
sensitive receptors,

00:02:56.886 --> 00:02:59.761
on the lookout for the right surface
on a bacterial cell.

00:03:00.158 --> 00:03:01.410
Once it finds it,

00:03:01.434 --> 00:03:04.363
the phage will latch on
to the bacterial cell wall

00:03:04.387 --> 00:03:05.987
and then inject its DNA.

00:03:06.371 --> 00:03:08.037
DNA sits in the head of the phage

00:03:08.061 --> 00:03:10.850
and travels into the bacteria
through the long body.

00:03:11.307 --> 00:03:13.998
At this point, the phage
reprograms the bacteria

00:03:14.022 --> 00:03:16.395
into producing lots of new phages.

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:19.351
The bacteria, in effect,
becomes a phage factory.

00:03:19.704 --> 00:03:23.664
Once around 50-100 phages have accumulated
within the bacteria cell,

00:03:23.688 --> 00:03:26.077
the phages are then able
to release a protein

00:03:26.101 --> 00:03:28.177
that disrupts the bacteria cell wall.

00:03:28.514 --> 00:03:31.680
As the bacteria bursts,
the phages move out

00:03:31.704 --> 00:03:34.459
and go on the hunt again
for a new bacteria to infect.

00:03:35.371 --> 00:03:38.466
Now, I'm sorry, this probably
sounded like a scary virus again.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.863
But it's exactly this ability of phages --

00:03:41.887 --> 00:03:44.578
to multiply within the bacteria
and then kill them --

00:03:44.602 --> 00:03:47.739
that make them so interesting
from a medical point of view.

00:03:47.763 --> 00:03:50.040
The other part that I find
extremely interesting

00:03:50.064 --> 00:03:52.318
is the scale at which this is going on.

00:03:52.342 --> 00:03:55.826
Now, just five years ago,
I really had no clue about phages.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.314
And yet, today I would tell you
they are part of a natural principle.

00:03:59.694 --> 00:04:03.702
Phages and bacteria go back
to the earliest days of evolution.

00:04:03.726 --> 00:04:07.227
They have always existed in tandem,
keeping each other in check.

00:04:07.765 --> 00:04:11.637
So this is really the story of yin
and yang, of the hunter and the prey,

00:04:11.661 --> 00:04:13.245
at a microscopic level.

00:04:14.005 --> 00:04:16.236
Some scientists have even estimated

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.990
that phages are the most
abundant organism on our planet.

00:04:20.863 --> 00:04:23.934
So even before we continue
talking about their medical potential,

00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:27.122
I think everybody should know
about phages and their role on earth:

00:04:27.146 --> 00:04:29.546
they hunt, infect and kill bacteria.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.511
Now, how come we have something
that works so well in nature,

00:04:33.535 --> 00:04:35.926
every day, everywhere around us,

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.704
and yet, in most parts of the world,

00:04:37.728 --> 00:04:39.744
we do not have a single drug on the market

00:04:39.768 --> 00:04:42.776
that uses this principle
to combat bacterial infections?

00:04:43.458 --> 00:04:47.276
The simple answer is: no one
has developed this kind of a drug yet,

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.459
at least not one that conforms
to the Western regulatory standards

00:04:50.483 --> 00:04:52.684
that set the norm
for so much of the world.

00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:56.089
To understand why,
we need to move back in time.

00:04:57.298 --> 00:04:59.496
This is a picture of FÃ©lix d'Herelle.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.966
He is one of the two scientists
credited with discovering phages.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.746
Except, when he discovered them
back in 1917, he had no clue

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.243
what he had discovered.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.008
He was interested in a disease
called bacillary dysentery,

00:05:12.032 --> 00:05:14.905
which is a bacterial infection
that causes severe diarrhea,

00:05:14.929 --> 00:05:17.373
and back then, was actually
killing a lot of people,

00:05:17.397 --> 00:05:21.141
because after all, no cure for bacterial
infections had been invented.

00:05:21.165 --> 00:05:25.075
He was looking at samples from patients
who had survived this illness.

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:27.332
And he found that something
weird was going on.

00:05:27.356 --> 00:05:29.712
Something in the sample
was killing the bacteria

00:05:29.736 --> 00:05:31.926
that were supposed to cause the disease.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.990
To find out what was going on,
he did an ingenious experiment.

00:05:35.395 --> 00:05:37.515
He took the sample, filtered it

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:40.794
until he was sure that only something
very small could have remained,

00:05:40.818 --> 00:05:45.063
and then took a tiny drop and added it
to freshly cultivated bacteria.

00:05:45.087 --> 00:05:47.263
And he observed
that within a number of hours,

00:05:47.287 --> 00:05:49.252
the bacteria had been killed.

00:05:49.276 --> 00:05:53.053
He then repeated this,
again filtering, taking a tiny drop,

00:05:53.077 --> 00:05:55.651
adding it to the next batch
of fresh bacteria.

00:05:55.675 --> 00:05:58.182
He did this in sequence 50 times,

00:05:58.206 --> 00:06:00.071
always observing the same effect.

00:06:00.095 --> 00:06:02.817
And at this point,
he made two conclusions.

00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:06.278
First of all, the obvious one:
yes, something was killing the bacteria,

00:06:06.302 --> 00:06:07.798
and it was in that liquid.

00:06:07.822 --> 00:06:10.607
The other one: it had to be
biologic in nature,

00:06:10.631 --> 00:06:14.306
because a tiny drop was sufficient
to have a huge impact.

00:06:14.853 --> 00:06:18.077
He called the agent he had found
an "invisible microbe"

00:06:18.101 --> 00:06:19.906
and gave it the name "bacteriophage,"

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.363
which, literally translated,
means "bacteria eater."

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.792
And by the way, this is one
of the most fundamental discoveries

00:06:25.816 --> 00:06:27.125
of modern microbiology.

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:31.363
So many modern techniques go back
to our understanding of how phages work --

00:06:31.387 --> 00:06:33.681
in genomic editing,
but also in other fields.

00:06:33.705 --> 00:06:36.664
And just today, the Nobel Prize
in chemistry was announced

00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:40.569
for two scientists who work with phages
and develop drugs based on that.

00:06:41.631 --> 00:06:43.758
Now, back in the 1920s and 1930s,

00:06:43.782 --> 00:06:46.695
people also immediately saw
the medical potential of phages.

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:48.378
After all, albeit invisible,

00:06:48.402 --> 00:06:50.925
you had something
that reliably was killing bacteria.

00:06:51.489 --> 00:06:54.950
Companies that still exist today,
such as Abbott, Squibb or Lilly,

00:06:54.974 --> 00:06:56.574
sold phage preparations.

00:06:57.204 --> 00:07:00.260
But the reality is, if you're starting
with an invisible microbe,

00:07:00.284 --> 00:07:02.691
it's very difficult to get
to a reliable drug.

00:07:03.117 --> 00:07:05.109
Just imagine going to the FDA today

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:07.439
and telling them all about
that invisible virus

00:07:07.463 --> 00:07:09.056
you want to give to patients.

00:07:09.752 --> 00:07:12.672
So when chemical antibiotics
emerged in the 1940s,

00:07:12.696 --> 00:07:14.787
they completely changed the game.

00:07:14.811 --> 00:07:16.819
And this guy played a major role.

00:07:16.843 --> 00:07:18.137
This is Alexander Fleming.

00:07:18.161 --> 00:07:19.970
He won the Nobel Prize in medicine

00:07:19.994 --> 00:07:22.129
for his work contributing
to the development

00:07:22.153 --> 00:07:24.120
of the first antibiotic, penicillin.

00:07:24.871 --> 00:07:28.998
And antibiotics really work
very differently than phages.

00:07:29.022 --> 00:07:31.799
For the most part, they inhibit
the growth of the bacteria,

00:07:31.823 --> 00:07:34.895
and they don't care so much
which kind of bacteria are present.

00:07:35.196 --> 00:07:37.126
The ones that we call broad-spectrum

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.742
will even work against
a whole bunch of bacteria out there.

00:07:40.766 --> 00:07:43.260
Compare that to phages,
which work extremely narrowly

00:07:43.284 --> 00:07:44.727
against one bacterial species,

00:07:44.751 --> 00:07:46.806
and you can see the obvious advantage.

00:07:47.575 --> 00:07:50.426
Now, back then, this must have felt
like a dream come true.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:53.649
You had a patient
with a suspected bacterial infection,

00:07:53.673 --> 00:07:55.268
you gave him the antibiotic,

00:07:55.292 --> 00:07:58.451
and without really needing to know
anything else about the bacteria

00:07:58.475 --> 00:07:59.649
causing the disease,

00:07:59.673 --> 00:08:01.188
many of the patients recovered.

00:08:01.212 --> 00:08:03.569
And so as we developed
more and more antibiotics,

00:08:03.593 --> 00:08:07.278
they, rightly so, became the first-line
therapy for bacterial infections.

00:08:07.831 --> 00:08:12.069
And by the way, they have contributed
tremendously to our life expectancy.

00:08:12.093 --> 00:08:14.799
We are only able to do
complex medical interventions

00:08:14.823 --> 00:08:16.466
and medical surgeries today

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:17.863
because we have antibiotics,

00:08:17.887 --> 00:08:20.393
and we don't risk the patient
dying the very next day

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:24.264
from the bacterial infection that he might
contract during the operation.

00:08:24.288 --> 00:08:28.178
So we started to forget about phages,
especially in Western medicine.

00:08:28.638 --> 00:08:32.372
And to a certain extent, even when
I was growing up, the notion was:

00:08:32.396 --> 00:08:36.228
we have solved bacterial infections;
we have antibiotics.

00:08:37.185 --> 00:08:39.908
Of course, today,
we know that this is wrong.

00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:42.950
Today, most of you
will have heard about superbugs.

00:08:42.974 --> 00:08:45.111
Those are bacteria
that have become resistant

00:08:45.135 --> 00:08:49.649
to many, if not all, of the antibiotics
that we have developed

00:08:49.673 --> 00:08:51.273
to treat this infection.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.094
How did we get here?

00:08:53.118 --> 00:08:56.092
Well, we weren't as smart
as we thought we were.

00:08:56.578 --> 00:08:59.521
As we started using
antibiotics everywhere --

00:08:59.545 --> 00:09:02.934
in hospitals, to treat and prevent;
at home, for simple colds;

00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.220
on farms, to keep animals healthy --

00:09:05.244 --> 00:09:06.644
the bacteria evolved.

00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:11.358
In the onslaught of antibiotics
that were all around them,

00:09:11.382 --> 00:09:14.401
those bacteria survived
that were best able to adapt.

00:09:15.017 --> 00:09:17.867
Today, we call these
"multidrug-resistant bacteria."

00:09:18.283 --> 00:09:20.418
And let me put a scary number out there.

00:09:20.442 --> 00:09:22.895
In a recent study commissioned
by the UK government,

00:09:22.919 --> 00:09:25.315
it was estimated that by 2050,

00:09:25.339 --> 00:09:29.457
ten million people could die every year
from multidrug-resistant infections.

00:09:29.871 --> 00:09:33.014
Compare that to eight million deaths
from cancer per year today,

00:09:33.038 --> 00:09:35.192
and you can see
that this is a scary number.

00:09:35.792 --> 00:09:38.587
But the good news is,
phages have stuck around.

00:09:39.014 --> 00:09:42.220
And let me tell you, they are not
impressed by multidrug resistance.

00:09:42.244 --> 00:09:43.395
(Laughter)

00:09:43.419 --> 00:09:49.172
They are just as happily killing
and hunting bacteria all around us.

00:09:50.028 --> 00:09:53.329
And they've also stayed selective,
which today is really a good thing.

00:09:53.353 --> 00:09:56.837
Today, we are able to reliably identify
a bacterial pathogen

00:09:56.861 --> 00:09:59.355
that's causing an infection
in many settings.

00:09:59.379 --> 00:10:02.477
And their selectivity will help us
avoid some of the side effects

00:10:02.501 --> 00:10:06.045
that are commonly associated
with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

00:10:06.609 --> 00:10:10.442
But maybe the best news of all is:
they are no longer an invisible microbe.

00:10:10.466 --> 00:10:11.791
We can look at them.

00:10:11.815 --> 00:10:13.260
And we did so together before.

00:10:13.284 --> 00:10:15.132
We can sequence their DNA.

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:16.752
We understand how they replicate.

00:10:16.776 --> 00:10:18.664
And we understand the limitations.

00:10:18.688 --> 00:10:20.055
We are in a great place

00:10:20.079 --> 00:10:24.093
to now develop strong and reliable
phage-based pharmaceuticals.

00:10:24.117 --> 00:10:26.299
And that's what's happening
around the globe.

00:10:26.323 --> 00:10:29.078
More than 10 biotech companies,
including our own company,

00:10:29.102 --> 00:10:32.687
are developing human-phage applications
to treat bacterial infections.

00:10:32.711 --> 00:10:36.918
A number of clinical trials
are getting underway in Europe and the US.

00:10:37.751 --> 00:10:40.061
So I'm convinced
that we're standing on the verge

00:10:40.085 --> 00:10:42.045
of a renaissance of phage therapy.

00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:46.297
And to me, the correct way to depict
the phage is something like this.

00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:49.347
(Laughter)

00:10:49.371 --> 00:10:52.847
To me, phages are the superheroes
that we have been waiting for

00:10:52.871 --> 00:10:55.960
in our fight against
multidrug-resistant infections.

00:10:56.617 --> 00:10:59.125
So the next time you think about a virus,

00:10:59.149 --> 00:11:00.749
keep this image in mind.

00:11:01.236 --> 00:11:04.220
After all, a phage might
one day save your life.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.000
Thank you.

00:11:06.024 --> 00:11:11.992
(Applause)
