00:00:25.777 --> 00:00:29.559
Images like this, from the Auschwitz
concentration camp,

00:00:29.583 --> 00:00:33.706
have been seared into our consciousness
during the 20th century

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.620
and have given us
a new understanding of who we are,

00:00:39.644 --> 00:00:42.843
where we've come from
and the times we live in.

00:00:42.867 --> 00:00:46.464
During the 20th century,
we witnessed the atrocities

00:00:46.488 --> 00:00:51.959
of Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot,
Rwanda and other genocides,

00:00:51.983 --> 00:00:55.460
and even though the 21st century
is only seven years old,

00:00:55.484 --> 00:00:59.285
we have already witnessed
an ongoing genocide in Darfur

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.507
and the daily horrors of Iraq.

00:01:02.087 --> 00:01:05.671
This has led to a common
understanding of our situation,

00:01:05.695 --> 00:01:08.808
namely, that modernity
has brought us terrible violence,

00:01:08.832 --> 00:01:12.100
and perhaps that native peoples
lived in a state of harmony

00:01:12.124 --> 00:01:15.562
that we have departed from, to our peril.

00:01:15.586 --> 00:01:19.506
Here is an example
from an op-ed on Thanksgiving,

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.682
in the "Boston Globe"
a couple of years ago,

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:25.085
where the writer wrote,
"The Indian life was a difficult one,

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:26.976
but there were no employment problems,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.023
community harmony was strong,
substance abuse unknown,

00:01:30.047 --> 00:01:31.697
crime nearly nonexistent.

00:01:31.721 --> 00:01:35.547
What warfare there was between tribes
was largely ritualistic

00:01:35.571 --> 00:01:38.932
and seldom resulted in indiscriminate
or wholesale slaughter."

00:01:38.956 --> 00:01:41.451
Now you're all familiar
with this treacle.

00:01:41.475 --> 00:01:43.780
We teach it to our children.

00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:46.927
We hear it on television
and in storybooks.

00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:51.724
Now, the original title of this session
was, "Everything You Know is Wrong,"

00:01:51.748 --> 00:01:53.343
and I'm going to present evidence

00:01:53.367 --> 00:01:56.346
that this particular part
of our common understanding is wrong,

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.452
that, in fact, our ancestors
were far more violent than we are,

00:02:00.476 --> 00:02:04.239
that violence has been in decline
for long stretches of time,

00:02:04.263 --> 00:02:07.317
and that today, we are probably
living in the most peaceful time

00:02:07.341 --> 00:02:09.157
in our species's existence.

00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:11.801
Now in the decade of Darfur and Iraq,

00:02:11.825 --> 00:02:16.790
a statement like that might seem somewhere
between hallucinatory and obscene,

00:02:16.814 --> 00:02:22.910
but I'm going to try to convince you
that that is the correct picture.

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:26.002
The decline of violence
is a fractal phenomenon.

00:02:26.026 --> 00:02:29.672
You can see it over millennia,
over centuries, over decades

00:02:29.696 --> 00:02:31.183
and over years,

00:02:31.207 --> 00:02:33.535
although there seems
to have been a tipping point

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:36.908
at the onset of the Age of Reason
in the 16th century.

00:02:36.932 --> 00:02:40.539
One sees it all over the world,
although not homogeneously.

00:02:40.563 --> 00:02:42.881
It's especially evident in the West,

00:02:42.905 --> 00:02:46.817
beginning with England and Holland
around the time of the Enlightenment.

00:02:46.841 --> 00:02:50.809
Let me take you on a journey
of several powers of 10 --

00:02:50.833 --> 00:02:53.127
from the millennium scale
to the year scale --

00:02:53.151 --> 00:02:55.282
to try to persuade you of this.

00:02:55.306 --> 00:02:58.930
Until 10,000 years ago,
all humans lived as hunter-gatherers,

00:02:58.954 --> 00:03:01.582
without permanent
settlements or government.

00:03:01.606 --> 00:03:06.945
And this is the state that's commonly
thought to be one of primordial harmony.

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:10.507
But the archaeologist Lawrence Keeley,

00:03:10.531 --> 00:03:15.870
looking at casualty rates
among contemporary hunter-gatherers,

00:03:15.894 --> 00:03:19.082
which is our best source of evidence
about this way of life,

00:03:19.106 --> 00:03:21.600
has shown a rather different conclusion.

00:03:21.624 --> 00:03:25.301
Here is a graph that he put together,

00:03:25.325 --> 00:03:28.418
showing the percentage
of male deaths due to warfare

00:03:28.442 --> 00:03:32.785
in a number of foraging
or hunting and gathering societies.

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:39.197
The red bars correspond
to the likelihood that a man will die

00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:40.716
at the hands of another man,

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.652
as opposed to passing away
of natural causes,

00:03:43.676 --> 00:03:47.917
in a variety of foraging societies
in the New Guinea highlands

00:03:47.941 --> 00:03:49.865
and the Amazon rain forest.

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.510
And they range from a rate of almost
a 60 percent chance that a man will die

00:03:53.534 --> 00:03:54.898
at the hands of another man

00:03:54.922 --> 00:03:59.177
to, in the case of the Gebusi,
only a 15 percent chance.

00:03:59.201 --> 00:04:02.269
The tiny little blue bar
in the lower left-hand corner

00:04:02.293 --> 00:04:05.856
plots the corresponding statistic
from the United States and Europe

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.194
in the 20th century,

00:04:07.218 --> 00:04:10.893
and it includes all the deaths
of both World Wars.

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:16.080
If the death rate in tribal warfare
had prevailed during the 20th century,

00:04:16.104 --> 00:04:19.976
there would have been two billion deaths
rather than 100 million.

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:22.629
Also on the millennium scale,

00:04:22.653 --> 00:04:26.051
we can look at the way of life
of early civilizations,

00:04:26.075 --> 00:04:29.142
such as the ones described in the Bible.

00:04:29.166 --> 00:04:32.976
And in this supposed source
of our moral values,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.010
one can read descriptions
of what was expected in warfare,

00:04:37.034 --> 00:04:39.762
such as the following, from Numbers 31:

00:04:39.786 --> 00:04:43.068
"And they warred against the Midianites
as the Lord commanded Moses,

00:04:43.092 --> 00:04:45.270
and they slew all the males.

00:04:45.294 --> 00:04:48.586
And Moses said unto them,
'Have you saved all the women alive?

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.644
Now, therefore, kill every male
among the little ones

00:04:51.668 --> 00:04:54.523
and kill every woman that hath known
man by lying with him,

00:04:54.547 --> 00:04:58.010
but all the women children that have not
known a man by lying with him,

00:04:58.034 --> 00:04:59.527
keep alive for yourselves.'"

00:04:59.551 --> 00:05:04.281
In other words: kill the men,
kill the children.

00:05:04.305 --> 00:05:08.072
If you see any virgins, then you can keep
them alive so that you can rape them.

00:05:08.096 --> 00:05:12.675
And you can find four or five passages
in the Bible of this ilk.

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:18.379
Also in the Bible, one sees that the death
penalty was the accepted punishment

00:05:18.403 --> 00:05:20.365
for crimes such as homosexuality,

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:24.591
adultery, blasphemy, idolatry,
talking back to your parents --

00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:25.668
(Laughter)

00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:27.822
and picking up sticks on the Sabbath.

00:05:28.576 --> 00:05:32.611
Well, let's click the zoom lens down
one order of magnitude

00:05:32.635 --> 00:05:34.577
and look at the century scale.

00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:38.492
Now, although we don't have
statistics for warfare

00:05:38.516 --> 00:05:40.722
throughout the Middle Ages
to modern times,

00:05:40.746 --> 00:05:42.651
we know just from conventional history

00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:45.475
that the evidence
was under our nose all along

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:49.950
that there has been a reduction
in socially sanctioned forms of violence.

00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:54.440
For example, any social history
will reveal that mutilation and torture

00:05:54.464 --> 00:05:56.609
were routine forms of criminal punishment.

00:05:56.633 --> 00:05:59.290
The kind of infraction today
that would give you a fine,

00:05:59.314 --> 00:06:02.873
in those days, would result
in your tongue being cut out,

00:06:02.897 --> 00:06:05.253
your ears being cut off,
you being blinded,

00:06:05.277 --> 00:06:07.562
a hand being chopped off and so on.

00:06:07.586 --> 00:06:11.841
There were numerous ingenious forms
of sadistic capital punishment:

00:06:11.865 --> 00:06:14.976
burning at the stake, disemboweling,
breaking on the wheel,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.785
being pulled apart by horses and so on.

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:22.330
The death penalty was a sanction
for a long list of nonviolent crimes:

00:06:22.354 --> 00:06:25.606
criticizing the king,
stealing a loaf of bread.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.451
Slavery, of course,
was the preferred labor-saving device,

00:06:29.475 --> 00:06:32.518
and cruelty was a popular
form of entertainment.

00:06:32.542 --> 00:06:35.976
Perhaps the most vivid example
was the practice of cat burning,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.611
in which a cat was hoisted on a stage
and lowered in a sling into a fire,

00:06:40.635 --> 00:06:45.769
and the spectators shrieked in laughter
as the cat, howling in pain,

00:06:45.793 --> 00:06:47.360
was burned to death.

00:06:48.138 --> 00:06:49.971
What about one-on-one murder?

00:06:49.995 --> 00:06:51.859
Well, there, there are good statistics,

00:06:51.883 --> 00:06:57.518
because many municipalities
recorded the cause of death.

00:06:57.542 --> 00:07:01.563
The criminologist Manuel Eisner

00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:04.603
scoured all of the historical
records across Europe

00:07:04.627 --> 00:07:10.123
for homicide rates in any village,
hamlet, town, county that he could find,

00:07:10.147 --> 00:07:12.548
and then he supplemented them
with national data

00:07:12.572 --> 00:07:14.961
when nations started keeping statistics.

00:07:14.985 --> 00:07:18.976
He plotted on a logarithmic scale,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.975
going from 100 deaths
per 100,000 people per year,

00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:30.418
which was approximately the rate
of homicide in the Middle Ages,

00:07:30.442 --> 00:07:33.043
and the figure plummets down

00:07:33.067 --> 00:07:37.939
to less than one homicide
per 100,000 people per year

00:07:37.963 --> 00:07:41.094
in seven or eight European countries.

00:07:41.118 --> 00:07:43.689
Then, there is a slight
uptick in the 1960s.

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:47.549
The people who said that rock and roll
would lead to the decline of moral values

00:07:47.573 --> 00:07:49.976
actually had a grain of truth to that.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.762
But there was a decline from at least
two orders of magnitude in homicide

00:07:54.786 --> 00:07:56.690
from the Middle Ages to the present,

00:07:56.714 --> 00:08:00.929
and the elbow occurred
in the early 16th century.

00:08:01.746 --> 00:08:04.262
Let's click down now to the decade scale.

00:08:04.286 --> 00:08:08.367
According to nongovernmental organizations
that keep such statistics,

00:08:08.391 --> 00:08:11.234
since 1945, in Europe and the Americas,

00:08:11.258 --> 00:08:14.976
there has been a steep
decline in interstate wars,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.763
in deadly ethnic riots or pogroms

00:08:17.787 --> 00:08:21.284
and in military coups,
even in South America.

00:08:21.308 --> 00:08:26.542
Worldwide, there's been a steep decline
in deaths in interstate wars.

00:08:26.566 --> 00:08:31.186
The yellow bars here show
the number of deaths per war per year

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.634
from 1950 to the present.

00:08:33.658 --> 00:08:36.361
And, as you can see,
the death rate goes down

00:08:36.385 --> 00:08:40.809
from 65,000 deaths
per conflict per year in the 1950s

00:08:40.833 --> 00:08:45.088
to less than 2,000 deaths
per conflict per year in this decade,

00:08:45.112 --> 00:08:46.549
as horrific as it is.

00:08:46.573 --> 00:08:49.976
Even in the year scale,
one can see a decline of violence.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.657
Since the end of the Cold War,
there have been fewer civil wars,

00:08:53.681 --> 00:08:59.527
fewer genocides -- indeed, a 90 percent
reduction since post-World War II highs --

00:08:59.551 --> 00:09:05.113
and even a reversal of the 1960s uptick
in homicide and violent crime.

00:09:05.137 --> 00:09:08.770
This is from the FBI
uniform crime statistics.

00:09:08.794 --> 00:09:12.880
You can see that there's a fairly low
rate of violence in the '50s and the '60s,

00:09:12.904 --> 00:09:16.318
then it soared upward for several decades

00:09:16.342 --> 00:09:20.018
and began a precipitous decline,
starting in the 1990s,

00:09:20.042 --> 00:09:24.976
so that it went back to the level
that was last enjoyed in 1960.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.305
President Clinton,
if you're here: thank you.

00:09:27.329 --> 00:09:29.035
(Laughter)

00:09:29.059 --> 00:09:30.210
So the question is:

00:09:30.234 --> 00:09:34.429
Why are so many people so wrong
about something so important?

00:09:34.453 --> 00:09:36.279
I think there are a number of reasons.

00:09:36.303 --> 00:09:38.216
One of them is we have better reporting.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.930
The Associated Press
is a better chronicler of wars

00:09:41.954 --> 00:09:43.395
over the surface of the earth

00:09:43.419 --> 00:09:45.327
than 16th-century monks were.

00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:46.387
(Laughter)

00:09:46.411 --> 00:09:47.819
There's a cognitive illusion.

00:09:47.843 --> 00:09:49.921
We cognitive psychologists know

00:09:49.945 --> 00:09:55.249
that the easier it is to recall
specific instances of something,

00:09:55.273 --> 00:09:57.976
the higher the probability
that you assign to it.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.163
Things that we read about
in the paper with gory footage

00:10:02.187 --> 00:10:06.780
burn into memory more than reports
of a lot more people dying

00:10:06.804 --> 00:10:08.544
in their beds of old age.

00:10:09.886 --> 00:10:13.161
There are dynamics in the opinion
and advocacy markets;

00:10:13.185 --> 00:10:18.180
no one ever attracted advocates and donors

00:10:18.204 --> 00:10:21.177
by saying, "Things just seem to be
getting better and better."

00:10:21.201 --> 00:10:22.287
(Laughter)

00:10:22.311 --> 00:10:24.907
There's guilt about our treatment
of native peoples

00:10:24.931 --> 00:10:26.581
in modern intellectual life,

00:10:26.605 --> 00:10:29.702
and an unwillingness to acknowledge
there could be anything good

00:10:29.726 --> 00:10:31.042
about Western culture.

00:10:31.066 --> 00:10:36.636
And, of course, our change in standards
can outpace the change in behavior.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.851
One of the reasons violence went down

00:10:38.875 --> 00:10:42.727
is that people got sick of the carnage
and cruelty in their time.

00:10:42.751 --> 00:10:44.851
That's a process
that seems to be continuing,

00:10:44.875 --> 00:10:49.130
but if it outstrips behavior
by the standards of the day,

00:10:49.154 --> 00:10:52.277
things always look more barbaric
than they would have been

00:10:52.301 --> 00:10:53.844
by historic standards.

00:10:53.868 --> 00:10:56.570
So today, we get exercised --
and rightly so --

00:10:56.594 --> 00:11:03.149
if a handful of murderers get executed
by lethal injection in Texas

00:11:03.173 --> 00:11:05.987
after a 15-year appeal process.

00:11:06.011 --> 00:11:08.972
We don't consider
that a couple of hundred years ago,

00:11:08.996 --> 00:11:13.303
they may have been burned at the stake
for criticizing the king after a trial

00:11:13.327 --> 00:11:15.066
that lasted 10 minutes,

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:18.365
and indeed, that that would have been
repeated over and over again.

00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:20.825
Today, we look at capital punishment

00:11:20.849 --> 00:11:24.364
as evidence of how low
our behavior can sink,

00:11:24.388 --> 00:11:27.001
rather than how high
our standards have risen.

00:11:27.777 --> 00:11:30.231
Well, why has violence declined?

00:11:30.255 --> 00:11:35.015
No one really knows,
but I have read four explanations,

00:11:35.039 --> 00:11:38.508
all of which, I think,
have some grain of plausibility.

00:11:38.532 --> 00:11:41.376
The first is: maybe
Thomas Hobbes got it right.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.557
He was the one who said

00:11:42.581 --> 00:11:46.478
that life in a state of nature
was "solitary, poor, nasty,

00:11:46.502 --> 00:11:47.989
brutish and short."

00:11:48.013 --> 00:11:49.038
(Laughter)

00:11:49.062 --> 00:11:51.356
Not because, he argued,

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.282
humans have some
primordial thirst for blood

00:11:54.306 --> 00:11:57.762
or aggressive instinct
or territorial imperative,

00:11:57.786 --> 00:12:00.089
but because of the logic of anarchy.

00:12:00.113 --> 00:12:01.270
In a state of anarchy,

00:12:01.294 --> 00:12:05.153
there's a constant temptation
to invade your neighbors preemptively,

00:12:05.177 --> 00:12:06.639
before they invade you.

00:12:06.663 --> 00:12:09.161
More recently, Thomas Schelling
gives the analogy

00:12:09.185 --> 00:12:11.765
of a homeowner who hears
a rustling in the basement.

00:12:11.789 --> 00:12:14.787
Being a good American,
he has a pistol in the nightstand,

00:12:14.811 --> 00:12:16.921
pulls out his gun, walks down the stairs.

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:20.063
And what does he see but a burglar
with a gun in his hand?

00:12:20.087 --> 00:12:21.724
Now, each one of them is thinking,

00:12:21.748 --> 00:12:25.096
"I don't really want to kill
that guy, but he's about to kill me.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.254
Maybe I had better shoot him
before he shoots me,

00:12:29.278 --> 00:12:31.770
especially since,
even if he doesn't want to kill me,

00:12:31.794 --> 00:12:35.514
he's probably worrying right now
that I might kill him before he kills me."

00:12:35.538 --> 00:12:36.696
And so on.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:41.952
Hunter-gatherer peoples explicitly
go through this train of thought

00:12:41.976 --> 00:12:45.854
and will often raid their neighbors
out of fear of being raided first.

00:12:46.631 --> 00:12:50.678
Now, one way of dealing
with this problem is by deterrence.

00:12:50.702 --> 00:12:54.976
You don't strike first, but you have
a publicly announced policy

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.433
that you will retaliate savagely
if you are invaded.

00:12:58.457 --> 00:13:03.573
The only thing is that it's liable
to having its bluff called,

00:13:03.597 --> 00:13:06.916
and therefore can only work
if it's credible.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:11.354
To make it credible, you must avenge
all insults and settle all scores,

00:13:11.378 --> 00:13:14.542
which leads to the cycles
of bloody vendetta.

00:13:14.566 --> 00:13:17.759
Life becomes an episode of "The Sopranos."

00:13:17.783 --> 00:13:20.557
Hobbes's solution, "Leviathan,"

00:13:20.581 --> 00:13:24.359
was that if authority
for the legitimate use of violence

00:13:24.383 --> 00:13:29.059
was vested in a single democratic
agency -- a leviathan --

00:13:29.083 --> 00:13:32.541
then such a state can reduce
the temptation of attack,

00:13:32.565 --> 00:13:34.976
because any kind of aggression
will be punished,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.824
leaving its profitability zero.

00:13:38.848 --> 00:13:42.071
That would remove the temptation
to invade preemptively

00:13:42.095 --> 00:13:44.500
out of fear of them attacking you first.

00:13:44.524 --> 00:13:48.019
It removes the need
for a hair trigger for retaliation

00:13:48.043 --> 00:13:50.350
to make your deterrent threat credible,

00:13:50.374 --> 00:13:53.191
and therefore, it would lead
to a state of peace.

00:13:53.215 --> 00:13:57.111
Eisner -- the man who plotted
the homicide rates

00:13:57.135 --> 00:14:00.396
that you failed to see
in the earlier slide --

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:04.249
argued that the timing
of the decline of homicide in Europe

00:14:04.273 --> 00:14:08.361
coincided with the rise
of centralized states.

00:14:08.385 --> 00:14:11.242
So that's a bit of a support
for the leviathan theory.

00:14:11.266 --> 00:14:15.344
Also supporting it is the fact
that we today see eruptions of violence

00:14:15.368 --> 00:14:19.589
in zones of anarchy,
in failed states, collapsed empires,

00:14:19.613 --> 00:14:23.820
frontier regions, mafias,
street gangs and so on.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:27.808
The second explanation
is that in many times and places,

00:14:27.832 --> 00:14:31.811
there is a widespread
sentiment that life is cheap.

00:14:31.835 --> 00:14:37.317
In earlier times, when suffering and early
death were common in one's own life,

00:14:37.341 --> 00:14:41.157
one has fewer compunctions
about inflicting them on others.

00:14:41.181 --> 00:14:45.688
And as technology and economic efficiency
make life longer and more pleasant,

00:14:45.712 --> 00:14:47.976
one puts a higher value
on life in general.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.531
This was an argument
from the political scientist James Payne.

00:14:52.244 --> 00:14:56.732
A third explanation invokes
the concept of a nonzero-sum game,

00:14:56.756 --> 00:15:01.376
and was worked out in the book "Nonzero"
by the journalist Robert Wright.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.032
Wright points out that,
in certain circumstances,

00:15:04.056 --> 00:15:08.722
cooperation or nonviolence can benefit
both parties in an interaction,

00:15:08.746 --> 00:15:14.044
such as gains in trade
when two parties trade their surpluses

00:15:14.068 --> 00:15:15.770
and both come out ahead,

00:15:15.794 --> 00:15:18.291
or when two parties lay down their arms

00:15:18.315 --> 00:15:20.378
and split the so-called peace dividend

00:15:20.402 --> 00:15:23.825
that results in them not having
to fight the whole time.

00:15:23.849 --> 00:15:26.613
Wright argues that technology
has increased the number

00:15:26.637 --> 00:15:30.849
of positive-sum games
that humans tend to be embroiled in,

00:15:30.873 --> 00:15:34.430
by allowing the trade of goods,
services and ideas

00:15:34.454 --> 00:15:37.868
over longer distances
and among larger groups of people.

00:15:37.892 --> 00:15:41.665
The result is that other people
become more valuable alive than dead,

00:15:41.689 --> 00:15:45.209
and violence declines for selfish reasons.

00:15:45.233 --> 00:15:46.600
As Wright put it,

00:15:46.624 --> 00:15:50.505
"Among the many reasons that I think
that we should not bomb the Japanese

00:15:50.529 --> 00:15:52.140
is that they built my minivan."

00:15:52.164 --> 00:15:53.822
(Laughter)

00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:58.411
The fourth explanation is captured
in the title of a book

00:15:58.435 --> 00:16:01.976
called "The Expanding Circle,"
by the philosopher Peter Singer,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.215
who argues that evolution bequeathed
humans with a sense of empathy,

00:16:07.239 --> 00:16:13.008
an ability to treat other people's
interests as comparable to one's own.

00:16:13.032 --> 00:16:14.591
Unfortunately, by default,

00:16:14.615 --> 00:16:18.130
we apply it only to a very narrow
circle of friends and family.

00:16:18.154 --> 00:16:21.233
People outside that circle
are treated as subhuman

00:16:21.257 --> 00:16:23.807
and can be exploited with impunity.

00:16:23.831 --> 00:16:27.173
But, over history,
the circle has expanded.

00:16:27.197 --> 00:16:29.512
One can see, in historical record,

00:16:29.536 --> 00:16:33.897
it expanding from the village,
to the clan, to the tribe, to the nation,

00:16:33.921 --> 00:16:37.390
to other races, to both sexes
and, in Singer's own arguments,

00:16:37.414 --> 00:16:40.756
something that we should extend
to other sentient species.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.118
So the question is:

00:16:43.142 --> 00:16:45.976
If this has happened,
what has powered that expansion?

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.970
And there are a number of possibilities,

00:16:47.994 --> 00:16:50.866
such as increasing circles of reciprocity

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:53.664
in the sense that Robert
Wright argues for.

00:16:53.688 --> 00:16:55.528
The logic of the Golden Rule --

00:16:55.552 --> 00:16:59.133
the more you think about
and interact with other people,

00:16:59.157 --> 00:17:06.127
the more you realize that it is untenable
to privilege your interests over theirs,

00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:08.363
at least not if you want
them to listen to you.

00:17:08.387 --> 00:17:12.412
You can't say that my interests
are special compared to yours

00:17:12.436 --> 00:17:13.699
any more than you can say

00:17:13.723 --> 00:17:17.761
the particular spot that I'm standing on
is a unique part of the universe

00:17:17.785 --> 00:17:21.405
because I happen to be standing
on it that very minute.

00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:25.330
It may also be powered
by cosmopolitanism, by histories

00:17:25.354 --> 00:17:30.340
and journalism and memoirs and realistic
fiction and travel and literacy,

00:17:30.364 --> 00:17:34.196
which allows you to project yourself
into the lives of other people

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.161
that formerly you may have
treated as subhuman,

00:17:37.185 --> 00:17:42.093
and also to realize the accidental
contingency of your own station in life,

00:17:42.117 --> 00:17:44.827
the sense that
"There but for fortune go I."

00:17:45.785 --> 00:17:47.486
Whatever its causes,

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:51.207
the decline of violence, I think,
has profound implications.

00:17:51.231 --> 00:17:54.475
It should force us to ask not just,
"Why is there war?"

00:17:54.499 --> 00:17:57.096
but also, "Why is there peace?"

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.052
Not just, "What are we doing wrong?"

00:17:59.076 --> 00:18:01.752
but also, "What have we been doing right?"

00:18:01.776 --> 00:18:03.855
Because we have been doing
something right,

00:18:03.879 --> 00:18:06.274
and it sure would be good
to find out what it is.

00:18:06.298 --> 00:18:07.499
Thank you very much.

00:18:07.523 --> 00:18:14.438
(Applause)

00:18:17.067 --> 00:18:20.000
Chris Anderson: I loved that talk.

00:18:20.024 --> 00:18:22.414
I think a lot of people
here in the room would say

00:18:22.438 --> 00:18:25.523
that that expansion
you were talking about,

00:18:25.547 --> 00:18:27.005
that Peter Singer talks about,

00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:30.683
is also driven just by technology,
by greater visibility of the other

00:18:30.707 --> 00:18:33.460
and the sense that the world
is therefore getting smaller.

00:18:33.484 --> 00:18:35.925
I mean, is that also a grain of truth?

00:18:35.949 --> 00:18:37.316
Steven Pinker: Very much.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.730
It would fit both in Wright's theory,

00:18:39.754 --> 00:18:43.996
that it allows us to enjoy
the benefits of cooperation

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:46.005
over larger and larger circles.

00:18:46.029 --> 00:18:51.292
But also, I think it helps us imagine
what it's like to be someone else.

00:18:51.316 --> 00:18:53.670
I think when you read
of these horrific tortures

00:18:53.694 --> 00:18:55.441
that were common in the Middle Ages,

00:18:55.465 --> 00:18:57.784
you think, "How could
they possibly have done it,

00:18:57.808 --> 00:19:00.181
how could they not have
empathized with the person

00:19:00.205 --> 00:19:01.567
that they're disemboweling?"

00:19:01.591 --> 00:19:06.115
But clearly, as far as they're concerned,
this is just an alien being

00:19:06.139 --> 00:19:08.294
that does not have feelings
akin to their own.

00:19:08.318 --> 00:19:10.208
Anything, I think, that makes it easier

00:19:10.232 --> 00:19:12.652
to imagine trading places
with someone else

00:19:12.676 --> 00:19:15.436
means that it increases
your moral consideration

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.666
to that other person.

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:19.939
CA: I'd love every news media
owner to hear that talk

00:19:19.963 --> 00:19:21.674
at some point, it's so important.

00:19:21.698 --> 00:19:23.150
CA: Thank you.
SP: My pleasure.
