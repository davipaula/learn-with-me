00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:35.044
When I was a little kid,
I loved to ask questions, I loved puzzles.

00:00:35.044 --> 00:00:38.114
I would begin sentence after sentence
with "I have a question."

00:00:38.265 --> 00:00:42.733
It aggravated my parents to no end
as you might imagine.

00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.280
But I had this curiosity:

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.873
I wanted to know things;
I wanted to know everything.

00:00:46.873 --> 00:00:49.950
And I always knew
I wanted to be a CIA officer.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.558
I used to write my diary in code,

00:00:52.558 --> 00:00:53.899
I would spy on -

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:54.899
(Laughter)

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.219
spy on on my sisters,

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.655
and I dreamed of one day
being a CIA officer.

00:01:01.655 --> 00:01:05.225
As a kid, I had a dear friend named Dusty,
who lived just around the corner,

00:01:05.225 --> 00:01:07.530
and we used to play together all the time.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.985
And Dusty had a grandmother named Yolanda.

00:01:09.985 --> 00:01:13.367
And when we were playing together,
Yolanda would come out and would say,

00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:15.285
"Dusty, ten cuidado.

00:01:15.285 --> 00:01:16.844
Dusty, tienes hambre?

00:01:16.844 --> 00:01:19.344
Dusty, te quiero mi hijo."

00:01:19.344 --> 00:01:20.480
And I would say,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.510
"What does that mean? What is she saying?"

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.487
And I would ask question after question,

00:01:24.487 --> 00:01:27.946
trying to understand
what it is that she was saying.

00:01:27.946 --> 00:01:31.473
Because I understood there
was a conversation happening around me,

00:01:31.473 --> 00:01:34.281
but there were holes
in the conversation I didn't understand

00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:36.203
because I didn't know the words.

00:01:36.347 --> 00:01:40.419
But as I became closer friends with Dusty
and spent more time with Yolanda,

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:43.597
I began to understand more
about them and their dynamic.

00:01:43.597 --> 00:01:46.678
So even when I didn't understand
the words "ten cuidado,"

00:01:46.678 --> 00:01:49.210
I knew Yolanda's face,
I knew what that meant.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.409
I knew we were probably doing something
we shouldn't be doing.

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.626
(Laughter)

00:01:53.626 --> 00:01:54.629
But what it taught me

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:57.864
was that accompanying
all of the questions I was asking,

00:01:57.864 --> 00:02:02.369
you had to build relationships
to be able to understand the context.

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:05.805
And so years later,
I did become a CIA officer,

00:02:05.805 --> 00:02:07.709
and I was very excited to realize

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:10.930
you could build an entire career
just asking questions.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:11.955
(Laughter)

00:02:11.955 --> 00:02:14.843
So it was really
the perfect career path for me.

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:16.137
(Laughter)

00:02:16.137 --> 00:02:18.445
And as a CIA case officer,

00:02:18.445 --> 00:02:21.234
I worked undercover 
my entire time with the agency,

00:02:21.234 --> 00:02:22.230
I worked overseas,

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.228
I worked everything

00:02:23.228 --> 00:02:25.986
from nuclear proliferation cases
to counterterrorism cases.

00:02:25.986 --> 00:02:28.289
It was exciting, and it was amazing.

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:29.584
And people always ask me,

00:02:29.584 --> 00:02:32.059
"Do you have any good CIA stories?"

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:33.970
and my answer is, "Yes, I do.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.761
But I can't tell you any of them."

00:02:36.761 --> 00:02:38.288
(Laughter)

00:02:38.738 --> 00:02:41.298
But I do have this one story
that was coming to mind,

00:02:41.298 --> 00:02:43.347
which is I used to meet this man.

00:02:43.347 --> 00:02:44.737
He was from another country,

00:02:44.737 --> 00:02:48.209
and he was committing espionage
on behalf of the United States government.

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.649
He was risking his life to provide us
with really valuable information

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:54.426
about a particular topic.

00:02:54.426 --> 00:02:57.981
Because when we, the United States,
were looking at this landscape,

00:02:57.981 --> 00:03:00.458
the relationship between
our country and his country,

00:03:00.458 --> 00:03:03.312
there were all these holes,
there were missing puzzle pieces,

00:03:03.312 --> 00:03:05.472
and we needed people to fill them in.

00:03:05.472 --> 00:03:07.675
And this man decided it was so important

00:03:07.675 --> 00:03:11.383
for the sake of furthering
better relationships between our countries

00:03:11.383 --> 00:03:15.223
and, frankly, avoiding
further challenging relationships,

00:03:15.223 --> 00:03:18.607
that if he could help fill in
some of those puzzle pieces,

00:03:18.607 --> 00:03:20.498
that could be really beneficial.

00:03:20.498 --> 00:03:22.174
So I used to meet him,

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.567
and when I would conduct
a debriefing like this,

00:03:24.567 --> 00:03:26.096
he would ask a lot of questions.

00:03:26.096 --> 00:03:28.393
So again, the professional question-asker,

00:03:28.393 --> 00:03:31.825
I would spend time
in advance of one of these meetings

00:03:31.825 --> 00:03:33.971
planning a laundry list of questions.

00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:35.447
I would talk with our analysts.

00:03:35.447 --> 00:03:39.157
I would talk with our reports officers
to make sure I understood the landscape,

00:03:39.157 --> 00:03:42.856
I knew what holes existed,
and I knew what questions to go and ask.

00:03:43.447 --> 00:03:46.204
Then I would get ready
for my surveillance detection route,

00:03:46.204 --> 00:03:48.302
which is when you
spend time on the street

00:03:48.302 --> 00:03:50.641
making sure that no one
is surveilling you,

00:03:50.641 --> 00:03:53.712
so that when you go into a meeting,
it's a secure location -

00:03:53.712 --> 00:03:55.841
you're not putting that person in danger.

00:03:56.511 --> 00:04:00.122
And usually the last thing I would do
before I left for one of these meetings

00:04:00.122 --> 00:04:02.388
would be look up online what had happened

00:04:02.388 --> 00:04:06.615
in the most recent episode
of the USA Network show "Covert Affairs."

00:04:06.615 --> 00:04:08.019
(Laughter)

00:04:08.161 --> 00:04:10.133
Because this gentleman,

00:04:10.133 --> 00:04:11.372
who was a foreign national

00:04:11.372 --> 00:04:14.064
providing information
to the United States government,

00:04:14.064 --> 00:04:15.756
to a real CIA officer,

00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:19.839
loved the show "Covert Affairs,"
starring Piper Perabo.

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:20.839
(Laughter)

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:24.088
I have no idea how he managed
to watch it in his home country,

00:04:24.088 --> 00:04:27.615
but that was the commonality
on which we built our relationship.

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:30.636
That was the foundation
of trust and friendship -

00:04:30.636 --> 00:04:32.370
I kid you not -

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.970
that predicated my ability to ask this man
so many important questions.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.017
For every person like him,
there's another story:

00:04:40.017 --> 00:04:42.303
Sometimes it was asking
about friends and family,

00:04:42.303 --> 00:04:44.067
sometimes it was asking about kids,

00:04:44.067 --> 00:04:48.156
sometimes it was connecting
over a sports team or a particular hobby.

00:04:48.156 --> 00:04:49.179
But for him,

00:04:49.179 --> 00:04:53.518
the irony that he loved "Covert Affairs"
was one that always made me laugh.

00:04:54.378 --> 00:04:58.726
And in 2014, my husband and I decided
we wanted to move back to Virginia,

00:04:58.726 --> 00:04:59.780
where we're both from,

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.096
so we could raise kids
closer to our families,

00:05:02.096 --> 00:05:03.213
get back home.

00:05:03.213 --> 00:05:05.787
I was working in the private sector
for a couple years,

00:05:05.787 --> 00:05:07.362
and then I decided, you know,

00:05:07.362 --> 00:05:11.598
what's harder than being a CIA officer
working undercover overseas?

00:05:11.598 --> 00:05:12.997
I know: running for Congress.

00:05:12.997 --> 00:05:14.443
(Laughter)

00:05:14.443 --> 00:05:16.706
That seems like a really good idea.

00:05:16.706 --> 00:05:18.616
Not only am I going to run for Congress,

00:05:18.616 --> 00:05:19.670
but I'm going to do it

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.862
in a district that hasn't elected
a Democrat in 50 years,

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:25.546
a district that's never elected a woman,

00:05:25.546 --> 00:05:27.980
a district where Trump won in 2016,

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.094
and a district where
there is so much division,

00:05:31.094 --> 00:05:33.423
like in so many places across the country.

00:05:33.423 --> 00:05:36.703
This strikes me as an excellent idea;
I'm definitely going to do this.

00:05:36.703 --> 00:05:37.937
(Laughter)

00:05:37.937 --> 00:05:39.911
Spoiler alert: I won, so -

00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:41.381
(Laughter)

00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:44.385
(Applause)

00:05:47.456 --> 00:05:51.391
But I ran because when I was looking
at what was happening in Washington

00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:53.245
and what was happening in my district,

00:05:53.245 --> 00:05:56.731
I felt that there were not enough
members of Congress doing two things:

00:05:56.731 --> 00:06:00.272
One, asking questions,
asking a lot of questions.

00:06:00.272 --> 00:06:01.988
What is it that our community needs?

00:06:01.988 --> 00:06:03.922
What is it that our country needs?

00:06:03.922 --> 00:06:07.389
What is this problem that is impacting
this community or that community

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:10.109
or our educational system or our climate

00:06:10.109 --> 00:06:12.950
or our job opportunities
in a particular region?

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.048
They weren't asking
questions of the experts:

00:06:15.048 --> 00:06:16.722
How is it that we can address this?

00:06:16.722 --> 00:06:18.956
How is it that we can build good policy?

00:06:18.956 --> 00:06:21.483
And for somebody
who had spent her prior career

00:06:21.483 --> 00:06:23.442
working to answer all of these questions

00:06:23.442 --> 00:06:26.499
so that policymakers
could make good decisions for me,

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:28.783
I needed to see
more questions being asked.

00:06:28.783 --> 00:06:30.218
And probably most importantly,

00:06:30.218 --> 00:06:32.693
I needed to see members of Congress

00:06:32.693 --> 00:06:35.355
who are asking questions
to their constituents back home,

00:06:35.355 --> 00:06:39.309
working hard to understand
what real issues impact their lives.

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:41.165
The second thing I didn't see happening

00:06:41.165 --> 00:06:43.731
was I didn't see people
building those relationships,

00:06:43.731 --> 00:06:46.225
getting out in the community
and talking to people.

00:06:46.225 --> 00:06:48.816
So across our campaign,
we met people everywhere -

00:06:48.816 --> 00:06:53.709
in barns, Aikido dojos, basements,

00:06:54.249 --> 00:06:56.282
fire houses, living rooms, dining rooms,

00:06:56.282 --> 00:06:57.285
everywhere -

00:06:57.396 --> 00:06:59.136
so that I could see people's lives

00:06:59.136 --> 00:07:01.323
and I could be present
in people's communities

00:07:01.323 --> 00:07:04.121
and I would be able to ask the questions:

00:07:04.121 --> 00:07:05.522
What's going on in your life?

00:07:05.522 --> 00:07:06.624
What concerns you most?

00:07:06.624 --> 00:07:10.254
What opportunities do you want
for your children that might be missing?

00:07:10.254 --> 00:07:13.373
What else do you think
Congress should be doing and focused on?

00:07:14.293 --> 00:07:19.147
And it was an incredible experience
traveling across the 7th District.

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:20.149
For those of you

00:07:20.149 --> 00:07:24.359
who did not spend as much time
driving across all 10 counties as I did,

00:07:24.359 --> 00:07:28.155
we stretch from Culpepper Virginia
to the suburbs of Richmond Virginia

00:07:28.155 --> 00:07:29.160
to Nottoway County.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.677
We are a long, skinny district,

00:07:30.677 --> 00:07:34.055
and we have a diverse
and vibrant population.

00:07:34.055 --> 00:07:35.380
And so after I won,

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.383
(Exhales)

00:07:36.383 --> 00:07:37.622
I thought, OK, this is it.

00:07:37.622 --> 00:07:40.525
Now I'm going to Congress;
we get to solve all these problems.

00:07:40.525 --> 00:07:42.903
And guess what happens
when you arrive in Congress?

00:07:43.772 --> 00:07:45.060
It's a crazy place.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.058
(Laughter)

00:07:46.058 --> 00:07:49.981
It's a wonderfully vibrant
but so crazy place.

00:07:49.981 --> 00:07:52.892
Because you have all these people
from all these districts

00:07:52.892 --> 00:07:55.096
working for all these different things.

00:07:55.096 --> 00:07:59.537
And in this particular year,
we have 63 new Democratic members.

00:07:59.537 --> 00:08:01.764
And you get to Congress, and you realize -

00:08:01.764 --> 00:08:03.099
yeah, you can clap for that.

00:08:03.099 --> 00:08:06.095
(Applause)

00:08:08.145 --> 00:08:09.517
And the new freshman class,

00:08:09.517 --> 00:08:13.422
we are from all over the country,
different ages, different backgrounds,

00:08:13.422 --> 00:08:16.887
different professional experiences,
personal experiences, everything.

00:08:16.887 --> 00:08:20.746
And everybody's got this urgency
to deliver something back home

00:08:20.746 --> 00:08:24.376
to help the people
back home in their districts.

00:08:24.487 --> 00:08:25.561
And when you look at -

00:08:25.561 --> 00:08:29.753
oh my goodness, what is the landscape
of what's happening in Congress,

00:08:29.753 --> 00:08:32.753
and what is the landscape
of what it is that we should be doing,

00:08:32.753 --> 00:08:34.642
you see there's all these holes.

00:08:34.642 --> 00:08:37.183
And you've got Republicans
arguing with Democrats,

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:39.418
you've got Republicans
arguing with Republicans,

00:08:39.418 --> 00:08:41.466
you've got Democrats
arguing with Democrats.

00:08:41.466 --> 00:08:43.666
How do you come together
to build relationships

00:08:43.666 --> 00:08:48.020
where you can fill in these holes
that exist across our country?

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.893
How in this time
where we are so divided

00:08:50.893 --> 00:08:52.565
can we strengthen the relationships

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:55.103
that will allow us
to deliver for our constituents

00:08:55.103 --> 00:08:59.677
and work to make this country
better and stronger into the future?

00:08:59.942 --> 00:09:01.350
And it starts with -

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.845
bear with me -

00:09:02.845 --> 00:09:05.860
asking questions
and building relationships.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.559
Because how is it that we can
move forward and create policy

00:09:09.559 --> 00:09:11.371
without talking to each other and say,

00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:12.751
OK, what are your priorities?

00:09:12.751 --> 00:09:15.157
Who can I work with?
How can I work with someone?

00:09:15.157 --> 00:09:17.617
How is it that we can,
in a divided government,

00:09:17.617 --> 00:09:20.180
pass a great bill
in the House of Representatives,

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:23.816
then get it passed in the Senate,
and then signed into law?

00:09:24.306 --> 00:09:26.562
These are the questions
we have to be asking.

00:09:26.562 --> 00:09:28.083
We have to be talking to experts

00:09:28.083 --> 00:09:30.174
to make sure that
as we're formulating ideas,

00:09:30.174 --> 00:09:32.269
they're built on facts
and data and evidence,

00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:34.119
and they're addressing real problems.

00:09:34.119 --> 00:09:36.212
Without evidence and data -

00:09:36.212 --> 00:09:37.209
yes.

00:09:37.209 --> 00:09:40.209
(Applause)

00:09:40.669 --> 00:09:43.113
And they're focused
on solving real problems.

00:09:43.113 --> 00:09:44.879
We're looking 10 years down the road:

00:09:44.879 --> 00:09:46.324
What could come from this?

00:09:46.324 --> 00:09:50.168
What could be some unintended
consequences or intended consequences,

00:09:50.168 --> 00:09:51.830
and how can we address them?

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.210
But in a time where we do
have so much division,

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:56.302
and we hear people back home
say things like,

00:09:56.302 --> 00:09:59.234
"It's so nice to be in such a group
of like-minded people,"

00:09:59.234 --> 00:10:00.287
I would challenge you:

00:10:00.287 --> 00:10:02.378
When you're in a group
of like-minded people,

00:10:02.378 --> 00:10:04.439
you can't solve problems, right?

00:10:04.439 --> 00:10:06.771
Because the problems exist
because of these holes,

00:10:06.771 --> 00:10:10.905
because of these broken pieces
in our community that we have to fill in,

00:10:10.905 --> 00:10:14.154
the differences in the gaps
that we have to start to close.

00:10:14.434 --> 00:10:16.343
And so how do you do this in Congress?

00:10:16.343 --> 00:10:18.011
Well, I have come up with a plan -

00:10:18.011 --> 00:10:19.337
it's very simple.

00:10:19.917 --> 00:10:21.159
On the floor of the House,

00:10:21.159 --> 00:10:24.069
you have your Democratic side
and your Republican side.

00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:27.372
And so I like to enter
on the Republican side.

00:10:27.782 --> 00:10:32.136
People are lingering
in the hallways or in the aisles;

00:10:32.136 --> 00:10:34.897
nobody's actually sitting -
not any critical mass at least.

00:10:34.897 --> 00:10:36.356
So you scooch by people:

00:10:36.356 --> 00:10:37.355
"Hi, how are you?

00:10:37.355 --> 00:10:39.502
Where are you from?
What's that district like?

00:10:39.502 --> 00:10:41.172
Do you have kids? What's going on?"

00:10:41.172 --> 00:10:43.841
When they're from a rural community,
my first question is

00:10:43.841 --> 00:10:46.454
"How is your broadband
internet infrastructure?"

00:10:46.454 --> 00:10:48.381
(Laughter)

00:10:48.515 --> 00:10:50.014
Because let me tell you:

00:10:50.014 --> 00:10:52.756
If there is a bipartisan issue,
that should be it.

00:10:52.756 --> 00:10:53.759
(Laughter)

00:10:53.759 --> 00:10:58.082
And if I can find common ground
around broadband internet infrastructure,

00:10:58.082 --> 00:11:01.003
that is the first piece
in just filling one gap,

00:11:01.069 --> 00:11:04.381
that is the first piece
in bringing some people together.

00:11:04.381 --> 00:11:05.380
And then we pivot:

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.050
"Hey, how about prescription drugs?

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:10.720
Hey, how about that road down the street?
It looks like it needs some repair."

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.165
And it's that way that we start
finding common ground.

00:11:14.165 --> 00:11:16.543
And it's by building relationships

00:11:16.543 --> 00:11:17.962
that we can start to repair

00:11:17.962 --> 00:11:21.710
so much of what's been broken down
in our communities.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:26.759
And so in ending today,
I would ask all of you a question -

00:11:27.259 --> 00:11:29.450
thematically, you should have
seen this coming.

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:30.450
(Laughter)

00:11:30.639 --> 00:11:32.649
My question to you is this:

00:11:32.899 --> 00:11:35.586
When you look at your community

00:11:35.586 --> 00:11:37.825
and you look at the landscape
in your community,

00:11:37.825 --> 00:11:42.252
can you identify holes and missing pieces
that might need to get filled in?

00:11:43.182 --> 00:11:47.000
And what questions do you need
to ask yourself and those around you

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:51.722
to further understand
what could address those holes,

00:11:51.722 --> 00:11:53.389
what could fill those gaps,

00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:56.860
what could make them
just a little bit less?

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:00.383
And then what people do you need to meet,

00:12:00.383 --> 00:12:03.684
what relationships
do you need to strengthen

00:12:03.684 --> 00:12:08.421
in order to be able to fill in those gaps,

00:12:09.631 --> 00:12:11.872
make those holes just a bit smaller,

00:12:11.872 --> 00:12:15.007
and make our communities
just a bit more complete?

00:12:15.112 --> 00:12:16.423
Thank you very much.

00:12:16.423 --> 00:12:19.388
(Applause)
