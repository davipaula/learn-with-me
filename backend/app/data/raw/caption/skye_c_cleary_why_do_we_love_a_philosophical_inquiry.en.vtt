00:00:07.141 --> 00:00:08.905
Ah, romantic love -

00:00:08.905 --> 00:00:10.839
beautiful and intoxicating,

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:13.259
heartbreaking and soul-crushing,

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.357
often all at the same time.

00:00:15.357 --> 00:00:18.919
Why do we choose to put ourselves
through its emotional wringer?

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:21.201
Does love make our lives meaningful,

00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:24.444
or is it an escape from our loneliness
and suffering?

00:00:24.444 --> 00:00:26.705
Is love a disguise for our sexual desire,

00:00:26.705 --> 00:00:30.409
or a trick of biology
to make us procreate?

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:32.337
Is it all we need?

00:00:32.337 --> 00:00:34.558
Do we need it at all?

00:00:34.558 --> 00:00:36.365
If romantic love has a purpose,

00:00:36.365 --> 00:00:39.965
neither science nor psychology
has discovered it yet.

00:00:39.965 --> 00:00:41.453
But over the course of history,

00:00:41.453 --> 00:00:46.866
some of our most respected philosophers
have put forward some intriguing theories.

00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:49.728
Love makes us whole, again.

00:00:49.728 --> 00:00:51.523
The ancient Greek philosopher Plato

00:00:51.523 --> 00:00:55.654
explored the idea that we love
in order to become complete.

00:00:55.654 --> 00:00:58.298
In his "Symposium",
he wrote about a dinner party,

00:00:58.298 --> 00:01:01.050
at which Aristophanes, a comic playwright,

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.298
regales the guests 
with the following story:

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:10.735
humans were once creatures with four arms,
four legs, and two faces.

00:01:10.735 --> 00:01:12.803
One day, they angered the gods,

00:01:12.803 --> 00:01:16.377
and Zeus sliced them all in two.

00:01:16.377 --> 00:01:21.368
Since then, every person has been missing
half of him or herself.

00:01:21.368 --> 00:01:26.253
Love is the longing to find a soulmate
who'll make us feel whole again,

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:31.918
or, at least, that's what Plato believed
a drunken comedian would say at a party.

00:01:31.918 --> 00:01:34.970
Love tricks us into having babies.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.199
Much, much later, German philosopher
Arthur Schopenhauer

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:41.155
maintained that love 
based in sexual desire

00:01:41.155 --> 00:01:43.734
was a voluptuous illusion.

00:01:43.734 --> 00:01:47.113
He suggested that we love because
our desires lead us to believe

00:01:47.113 --> 00:01:52.165
that another person will make us happy,
but we are sorely mistaken.

00:01:52.165 --> 00:01:54.330
Nature is tricking us into procreating,

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.698
and the loving fusion we seek
is consummated in our children.

00:01:58.698 --> 00:02:00.662
When our sexual desires are satisfied,

00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:04.102
we are thrown back 
into our tormented existences,

00:02:04.102 --> 00:02:06.933
and we succeed only in maintaining
the species

00:02:06.933 --> 00:02:11.215
and perpetuating the cycle 
of human drudgery.

00:02:11.215 --> 00:02:13.504
Sounds like somebody needs a hug.

00:02:13.504 --> 00:02:16.559
Love is escape from our loneliness.

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:20.397
According to the Nobel Prize-winning
British philosopher Bertrand Russell,

00:02:20.397 --> 00:02:24.614
we love in order to quench
our physical and psychological desires.

00:02:24.614 --> 00:02:27.180
Humans are designed to procreate,

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.984
but without the ecstasy 
of passionate love,

00:02:29.984 --> 00:02:32.369
sex is unsatisfying.

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:36.464
Our fear of the cold, cruel world
tempts us to build hard shells

00:02:36.464 --> 00:02:38.967
to protect and isolate ourselves.

00:02:38.967 --> 00:02:44.697
Love's delight, intimacy, and warmth
helps us overcome our fear of the world,

00:02:44.697 --> 00:02:46.309
escape our lonely shells,

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:49.235
and engage more abundantly in life.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:54.155
Love enriches our whole being,
making it the best thing in life.

00:02:54.155 --> 00:02:56.664
Love is a misleading affliction.

00:02:56.664 --> 00:02:57.908
Siddhārtha Gautama,

00:02:57.908 --> 00:03:00.487
who became known as the Buddha,
or the Enlightened One,

00:03:00.487 --> 00:03:04.001
probably would have had some interesting
arguments with Russell.

00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:08.992
Buddha proposed that we love because
we are trying to satisfy our base desires.

00:03:08.992 --> 00:03:12.635
Yet, our passionate cravings are defects,

00:03:12.635 --> 00:03:17.346
and attachments, even romantic love,
are a great source of suffering.

00:03:17.346 --> 00:03:20.137
Luckily, Buddha discovered 
the eight-fold path,

00:03:20.137 --> 00:03:23.479
a sort of program for 
extinguishing the fires of desire

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:25.642
so that we can reach Nirvana,

00:03:25.642 --> 00:03:30.560
an enlightened state of peace, clarity,
wisdom, and compassion.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.199
The novelist Cao Xueqin illustrated
this Buddhist sentiment

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:39.182
that romantic love is folly in 
one of China's greatest classical novels,

00:03:39.182 --> 00:03:41.900
"Dream of the Red Chamber."

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.370
In a subplot, Jia Rui 
falls in love with Xi-feng

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.680
who tricks and humiliates him.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.293
Conflicting emotions of love and hate
tear him apart,

00:03:51.293 --> 00:03:55.159
so a Taoist gives him a magic mirror
that can cure him

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:57.765
as long as he doesn't 
look at the front of it.

00:03:57.765 --> 00:04:00.370
But of course, 
he looks at the front of it.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.278
He sees Xi-feng.

00:04:02.278 --> 00:04:03.878
His soul enters the mirror

00:04:03.878 --> 00:04:08.715
and he is dragged away 
in iron chains to die.

00:04:08.715 --> 00:04:12.372
Not all Buddhists think this way
about romantic and erotic love,

00:04:12.372 --> 00:04:13.985
but the moral of this story

00:04:13.985 --> 00:04:17.045
is that such attachments
spell tragedy,

00:04:17.045 --> 00:04:20.901
and should, along with magic mirrors,
be avoided.

00:04:20.901 --> 00:04:24.092
Love lets us reach beyond ourselves.

00:04:24.092 --> 00:04:26.899
Let's end on a slightly 
more positive note.

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:29.048
The French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir

00:04:29.048 --> 00:04:32.934
proposed that love is the desire
to integrate with another

00:04:32.934 --> 00:04:35.652
and that it infuses our lives
with meaning.

00:04:35.652 --> 00:04:38.515
However, she was less 
concerned with why we love

00:04:38.515 --> 00:04:42.463
and more interested 
in how we can love better.

00:04:42.463 --> 00:04:45.780
She saw that the problem
with traditional romantic love

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.552
is it can be so captivating,

00:04:47.552 --> 00:04:51.294
that we are tempted to make it
our only reason for being.

00:04:51.294 --> 00:04:54.800
Yet, dependence on another 
to justify our existence

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.684
easily leads to boredom and power games.

00:04:58.684 --> 00:05:02.518
To avoid this trap, Beauvoir advised
loving authentically,

00:05:02.518 --> 00:05:04.937
which is more like a great friendship.

00:05:04.937 --> 00:05:07.933
Lovers support each other 
in discovering themselves,

00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:09.767
reaching beyond themselves,

00:05:09.767 --> 00:05:13.463
and enriching their lives
and the world together.

00:05:13.463 --> 00:05:16.558
Though we might never know
why we fall in love,

00:05:16.558 --> 00:05:20.548
we can be certain that it will be
an emotional rollercoaster ride.

00:05:20.548 --> 00:05:22.259
It's scary and exhilarating.

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:23.257
It makes us suffer

00:05:23.257 --> 00:05:25.145
and makes us soar.

00:05:25.145 --> 00:05:26.667
Maybe we lose ourselves.

00:05:26.667 --> 00:05:28.238
Maybe we find ourselves.

00:05:28.238 --> 00:05:29.724
It might be heartbreaking,

00:05:29.724 --> 00:05:32.557
or it might just be 
the best thing in life.

00:05:32.557 --> 00:05:34.511
Will you dare to find out?
