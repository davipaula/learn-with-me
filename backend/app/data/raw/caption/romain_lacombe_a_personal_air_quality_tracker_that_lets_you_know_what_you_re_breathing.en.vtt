00:00:12.917 --> 00:00:15.559
So for the past 12 years,

00:00:15.583 --> 00:00:17.184
I've been obsessed with this idea

00:00:17.208 --> 00:00:20.183
that climate change
is an information issue

00:00:20.208 --> 00:00:22.434
that computers will help us fight.

00:00:22.458 --> 00:00:25.101
I went from data science
to climate policy research,

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:26.518
from tech to public service,

00:00:26.542 --> 00:00:28.476
in pursuit of better data

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.601
to avoid the wasted energy,
resources, opportunities

00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:33.625
that lead to runaway carbon emissions.

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:37.583
Until one day, running in the streets
with a friend, it hit me:

00:00:38.792 --> 00:00:41.851
the same cars, factories, power plants

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:44.976
whose emissions are wrecking
our climate over time

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.851
also release harmful, local pollutants

00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:50.268
that threaten our health
right here and right now.

00:00:50.292 --> 00:00:54.518
All this time I'd focused
on the long-term environmental risk

00:00:54.542 --> 00:00:56.434
when I should have been up in arms

00:00:56.458 --> 00:01:00.309
about the immediate health impact
of pollutants in the air.

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:02.851
Air pollution is a burning
public health crisis.

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:05.476
It kills seven million people every year,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.143
it costs five trillion dollars
to the world economy

00:01:10.167 --> 00:01:14.101
and, worst, it robs us
of our most precious gift,

00:01:14.125 --> 00:01:15.893
the years in our lives:

00:01:15.917 --> 00:01:19.601
six months of life expectancy
in my hometown of Paris

00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:23.351
and up to three, four, five years
in parts of India and China.

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:28.833
And in the US, more people die
from car exhaust than from car accidents.

00:01:30.083 --> 00:01:32.625
So how do we protect
ourselves from pollution?

00:01:33.375 --> 00:01:36.601
The reason it's difficult
is an information gap.

00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:39.893
We simply lack the data
to understand our exposure.

00:01:39.917 --> 00:01:43.851
And that's because the way
we monitor air quality today

00:01:43.875 --> 00:01:47.851
is designed not to help people breathe
but to help governments govern.

00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:52.059
Most major cities operate networks
of air-quality monitoring stations

00:01:52.083 --> 00:01:53.351
like this one in London,

00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:56.643
to decide when to cut traffic
or when to shut down factories.

00:01:56.667 --> 00:01:59.684
And these machines
are like the computers from the '60s

00:01:59.708 --> 00:02:01.018
that filled entire rooms.

00:02:01.042 --> 00:02:05.226
They're incredibly precise
but incredibly large,

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.934
heavy, costly --

00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.726
so much that you can only deploy
just a few of them,

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.226
and they cannot move.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.684
So to governments,
air pollution looks like this.

00:02:13.708 --> 00:02:15.184
But for the rest of us,

00:02:15.208 --> 00:02:17.809
air quality looks like this.

00:02:17.833 --> 00:02:19.143
It changes all the time:

00:02:19.167 --> 00:02:21.143
hour by hour, street by street,

00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:23.851
up to eight times
within a single city block.

00:02:23.875 --> 00:02:26.226
And even more from indoor to outdoor.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.851
So unless you happen to be walking
right next to one of those stations,

00:02:29.875 --> 00:02:31.934
they just cannot tell you
what you breathe.

00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.226
So what would environmental
protection look like

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.833
if it was designed
for the age of the smartphone?

00:02:37.458 --> 00:02:38.976
So for the past three years,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.559
my team and I have been
building a technology

00:02:42.583 --> 00:02:44.309
that helps you know what you breathe

00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:45.792
and fits in your hand.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.726
Flow is a personal air-quality tracker
that you can wear with you

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.559
on a backpack, a bike, a stroller.

00:02:53.583 --> 00:02:55.601
It's packed with miniature sensors

00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:58.684
that monitor the most important
pollutants in the air around you,

00:02:58.708 --> 00:03:00.393
like nitrogen oxides,

00:03:00.417 --> 00:03:01.768
the exhaust gas from cars,

00:03:01.792 --> 00:03:04.601
or particulate matter
that gets into your bloodstream

00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:06.559
and creates strokes and heart issues.

00:03:06.583 --> 00:03:09.101
Or volatile organic compounds,

00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:11.434
the thousands of chemicals
in everyday products

00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:13.059
that we end up breathing.

00:03:13.083 --> 00:03:15.143
And that makes this data actionable

00:03:15.167 --> 00:03:17.351
and helps you understand
what you're breathing

00:03:17.375 --> 00:03:21.184
by telling you where and when
you've been exposed to poor air quality,

00:03:21.208 --> 00:03:23.768
and that way you can make
informed decisions

00:03:23.792 --> 00:03:25.393
to take action against pollution.

00:03:25.417 --> 00:03:27.518
You can change the products
you use at home,

00:03:27.542 --> 00:03:29.893
you can find the best route
to cycle to work,

00:03:29.917 --> 00:03:32.768
you can run when pollution is not peaking

00:03:32.792 --> 00:03:35.559
and you can find the best park
to bring your children out.

00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:39.518
Over time you build better habits
to decrease your exposure to pollution,

00:03:39.542 --> 00:03:42.934
and by tracking air quality around them,

00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.809
cyclists, commuters, parents

00:03:44.833 --> 00:03:48.101
will also contribute
to mapping air quality in their city.

00:03:48.125 --> 00:03:49.934
So we're building more than a device,

00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.476
but a community.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.768
And last summer,

00:03:52.792 --> 00:03:58.268
we sent early prototypes of our technology
to 100 volunteers in London,

00:03:58.292 --> 00:04:01.268
and together they mapped air quality

00:04:01.292 --> 00:04:04.018
across 1,000 miles of sidewalk

00:04:04.042 --> 00:04:06.309
and 20 percent of all of central London.

00:04:06.333 --> 00:04:09.018
So our goal now is to scale
this work around the world,

00:04:09.042 --> 00:04:12.643
to crowdsource data so we can map
air quality on every street,

00:04:12.667 --> 00:04:14.809
to build an unprecedented database

00:04:14.833 --> 00:04:17.226
so scientists can research pollution,

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.434
and to empower citizens,
civic leaders, policy makers

00:04:21.458 --> 00:04:24.000
to support clean-air policies for change.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.851
Because this can and must change.

00:04:28.875 --> 00:04:31.142
Remember cigarettes in bars?

00:04:31.166 --> 00:04:35.601
It took decades of lung cancer research
and second-hand smoking studies,

00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:39.309
but eventually, we reached a tipping point
and we passed smoking-ban laws.

00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:43.143
We must reach the same tipping point
for air quality and I believe we will.

00:04:43.167 --> 00:04:44.934
In the past couple years alone,

00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.601
governments have fined
carmakers record amounts

00:04:47.625 --> 00:04:49.351
for cheating on emission standards.

00:04:49.375 --> 00:04:52.893
Cities have passed congestion charges
or built bike lanes --

00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:55.601
like Paris that turned this highway,

00:04:55.625 --> 00:04:57.934
right next to my home,
in the middle of the city,

00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.726
into a waterfront park.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.434
And now mayors around the world
are thinking of banning diesel outright

00:05:03.458 --> 00:05:06.500
by 2025, 2030, 2035.

00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:10.833
But how much faster could we go,
how many lives could we save?

00:05:12.042 --> 00:05:15.226
Technology alone
will not solve climate change,

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.184
nor will it make air pollution
disappear overnight.

00:05:18.208 --> 00:05:22.518
But it can make the quality
of our air much more transparent,

00:05:22.542 --> 00:05:23.976
and if we can empower people

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.143
to take action
to improve their own health,

00:05:26.167 --> 00:05:29.750
then together we can act
to bring an end to our pollution.

00:05:30.375 --> 00:05:31.643
Thank you very much.

00:05:31.667 --> 00:05:33.750
(Applause)
