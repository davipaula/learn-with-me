00:00:13.358 --> 00:00:15.587
Have you ever felt lonely?

00:00:16.842 --> 00:00:19.557
The urge of wanting
to connect with people,

00:00:19.581 --> 00:00:22.662
but you seem to have no one
you really would want to contact?

00:00:23.877 --> 00:00:26.689
Or, it's a Friday night
and you want to be with others,

00:00:26.713 --> 00:00:32.266
but you have no energy to go out,
so instead you sit at home all evening,

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.796
watch Netflix

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.977
and feel more alone than ever?

00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:38.624
You feel like a monster

00:00:38.648 --> 00:00:41.145
between humans that know how to function.

00:00:42.193 --> 00:00:46.252
This is what loneliness felt like to me.

00:00:47.856 --> 00:00:49.241
So I'm an artist,

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:53.843
and I process my emotional world
by sharing my feelings through my art.

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:57.776
If you share your feelings with someone,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.355
and they understand
and share those feelings too,

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.866
you create an emotional
and deep connection.

00:01:05.456 --> 00:01:09.687
This is why you can be surrounded
by hundreds of people,

00:01:09.711 --> 00:01:12.567
jump from one candidate to the next,

00:01:12.591 --> 00:01:14.895
but still feel lonely.

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:19.507
It's because these deeper connections
haven't been made.

00:01:21.258 --> 00:01:24.070
I was an always-happy child.

00:01:24.094 --> 00:01:26.751
I think we nearly have
no single photo of me

00:01:26.775 --> 00:01:29.752
where I don't smile broadly
or laugh or joke around.

00:01:29.776 --> 00:01:32.246
And this went on until ...

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.193
well, it's still the case.

00:01:34.217 --> 00:01:38.477
But I had many friend groups

00:01:38.501 --> 00:01:42.102
up until, as a young adult,
I moved to another city

00:01:42.126 --> 00:01:44.947
for my first job as a comic artist.

00:01:45.857 --> 00:01:50.670
And like so many young,
thriving people all over the planet,

00:01:50.694 --> 00:01:54.698
I concentrated all my energy
into my work life.

00:01:55.816 --> 00:02:01.486
But, if you spend, like, 90 percent
of your daily capacity

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.608
trying to succeed at work,

00:02:03.632 --> 00:02:05.228
of course there is nothing left

00:02:05.252 --> 00:02:08.189
to take care of all the other
important aspects in your life,

00:02:08.213 --> 00:02:10.228
like your human relationships.

00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:16.353
Nourishing friendships
as an adult is work.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.071
You need to be consistent with connecting.

00:02:21.095 --> 00:02:23.668
You need to be open,
you need to be honest.

00:02:23.692 --> 00:02:25.811
And this is all I struggled with,

00:02:25.835 --> 00:02:28.848
because I tend to camouflage
my real feelings

00:02:28.872 --> 00:02:31.096
by trying to appear always happy

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.488
and trying to make
everyone else happy, too,

00:02:33.512 --> 00:02:35.803
by trying to fix their problems.

00:02:36.843 --> 00:02:40.207
And I know a lot of us are guilty of this,

00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:44.082
because it's an easy way to not
think about your own issues.

00:02:44.106 --> 00:02:45.384
Isn't it?

00:02:45.408 --> 00:02:46.888
Hmm? Hmm? Hmm?

00:02:46.912 --> 00:02:49.174
(Laughter)

00:02:49.198 --> 00:02:50.348
OK.

00:02:51.428 --> 00:02:54.213
The turning point came

00:02:54.237 --> 00:02:59.343
when I fell into an emotionally
abusive relationship

00:02:59.367 --> 00:03:00.891
just a few years ago.

00:03:01.492 --> 00:03:03.713
He isolated me

00:03:03.737 --> 00:03:07.370
and left me feeling more alone than ever.

00:03:08.565 --> 00:03:10.347
It was the lowest point in my life,

00:03:10.371 --> 00:03:13.451
but it was also my wake-up call,

00:03:13.475 --> 00:03:15.463
because it was the first time

00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:18.552
that I really felt loneliness.

00:03:20.354 --> 00:03:23.136
Many artists put
their feelings into their art.

00:03:23.747 --> 00:03:28.246
There are endless books,
movies, paintings, music,

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.130
all filled with the real
emotion of an artist.

00:03:31.154 --> 00:03:33.966
So, as an artist myself, I did the same.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.228
I shared my feelings.

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:41.606
I wanted to help people
cope with loneliness.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.253
I wanted, yeah, to make them
understand it,

00:03:44.277 --> 00:03:48.241
to really experience it through my art

00:03:48.265 --> 00:03:51.758
in the form of an interactive story,

00:03:51.782 --> 00:03:53.111
a video game.

00:03:54.825 --> 00:03:57.062
So, in our game --

00:03:57.086 --> 00:04:00.431
we called it "Sea of Solitude" --

00:04:00.455 --> 00:04:02.956
you are a person named Kay,

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.358
who is suffering from
such strong loneliness

00:04:06.382 --> 00:04:08.696
that her inner feelings --

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.958
the anger,

00:04:09.982 --> 00:04:13.771
the feeling of hopelessness,
worthlessness --

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:15.774
turn to the outside,

00:04:15.798 --> 00:04:17.334
and she becomes a monster.

00:04:17.869 --> 00:04:20.086
The game -- well, Kay --

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.093
is actually a representation of me

00:04:23.117 --> 00:04:27.222
and the path I went through
to overcome my struggles.

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:30.421
The game plays, actually, in Kay's mind,

00:04:30.445 --> 00:04:35.268
so you walk through a world
that is flooded by her tears,

00:04:35.292 --> 00:04:39.494
and the weather is changing by her mood,

00:04:39.518 --> 00:04:41.461
how her mood is changing.

00:04:42.301 --> 00:04:47.620
And, well, the only thing Kay wears,

00:04:47.644 --> 00:04:49.497
the only thing,

00:04:49.521 --> 00:04:51.130
is her backpack.

00:04:52.272 --> 00:04:56.973
It's the baggage we all carry
throughout our life.

00:04:56.997 --> 00:05:00.252
And Kay doesn't know how to cope
with her emotions in the right way,

00:05:00.276 --> 00:05:03.024
so her backpack becomes bigger and bigger

00:05:03.048 --> 00:05:04.492
until it bursts,

00:05:04.516 --> 00:05:08.794
and she finally is forced
to overcome her own struggles.

00:05:10.135 --> 00:05:15.221
In our story, we present many different
manifestations of loneliness.

00:05:16.443 --> 00:05:20.428
Loneliness through
social exclusion is very common.

00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:24.983
In our game, the brother of Kay
got bullied in his school,

00:05:25.007 --> 00:05:27.655
and he just wants to hide and fly away.

00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:31.923
And we portray him as a huge bird monster
surrounded by thick fog.

00:05:33.317 --> 00:05:35.816
The player has to actually
walk through his school

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.592
and experience, really feel the harm,

00:05:39.616 --> 00:05:41.437
that the brother had been through,

00:05:42.488 --> 00:05:45.442
because for a long time,
nobody really listens to him.

00:05:46.081 --> 00:05:51.513
But the very moment
friends and family start to listen,

00:05:51.537 --> 00:05:56.350
the first step towards overcoming
this form of loneliness had been made.

00:05:56.374 --> 00:06:00.343
We also show loneliness in relationships,

00:06:00.367 --> 00:06:05.139
like when parents just stay together
for the sake of their kids

00:06:05.163 --> 00:06:08.022
but end up hurting the entire family.

00:06:09.182 --> 00:06:15.279
We put the player literally in between
the two parents while they are fighting,

00:06:15.303 --> 00:06:17.154
and you get hurt in the middle.

00:06:17.545 --> 00:06:22.146
They don't even see that their daughter,
Kay, is right there

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.891
until she breaks down.

00:06:25.016 --> 00:06:30.047
We also show loneliness
through mental health issues,

00:06:30.071 --> 00:06:34.150
with the boyfriend of Kay,
who suffers from depression

00:06:34.174 --> 00:06:36.692
and shows that sometimes

00:06:36.716 --> 00:06:41.926
it is most important to focus
on your own well-being first.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.233
The boyfriend also tends
to camouflage his feelings,

00:06:47.257 --> 00:06:51.352
so he appears like a lone,
shiny white wolf.

00:06:51.376 --> 00:06:55.828
But the moment he starts
to interact with his girlfriend, Kay,

00:06:55.852 --> 00:06:57.439
the mask falls off,

00:06:57.463 --> 00:07:00.829
and we see the black dog beneath it:

00:07:00.853 --> 00:07:02.152
depression.

00:07:03.355 --> 00:07:06.623
Sometimes we put on a smile

00:07:06.647 --> 00:07:10.304
instead of dealing
with the issues at hand,

00:07:10.328 --> 00:07:13.006
and that can ultimately make it worse,

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.138
affect the people around us

00:07:15.162 --> 00:07:17.220
and damage our relationships.

00:07:19.561 --> 00:07:20.827
So Kay herself

00:07:20.851 --> 00:07:25.281
we portray as ripped apart
into her basic emotions.

00:07:26.457 --> 00:07:27.732
Some help you,

00:07:27.756 --> 00:07:29.880
some are trying to stop you.

00:07:30.994 --> 00:07:34.165
Self-Doubt is a huge creature,

00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:37.408
always telling Kay how worthless she is

00:07:37.432 --> 00:07:39.690
and that she should just give up.

00:07:40.167 --> 00:07:41.646
Like in real life,

00:07:42.531 --> 00:07:44.869
Self-Doubt is blocking the path,

00:07:44.893 --> 00:07:47.128
and it seems impossible to overcome it.

00:07:48.271 --> 00:07:52.705
Destroying the omnipresence
of Self-Doubt is a slow process.

00:07:52.729 --> 00:07:56.501
But in the game,
you can slowly, like, shrink her,

00:07:56.525 --> 00:07:58.981
so she turns from self-doubt

00:07:59.005 --> 00:08:00.791
to actually healthy doubt,

00:08:00.815 --> 00:08:03.045
and you can finally trust her advice.

00:08:04.544 --> 00:08:07.251
We also show Self-Destruction.

00:08:07.769 --> 00:08:09.391
It's a huge monster

00:08:09.415 --> 00:08:12.722
always lurking nearby
under the water's surface.

00:08:13.627 --> 00:08:16.635
Self-Destruction is actually
the main antagonist of the game,

00:08:16.659 --> 00:08:20.673
and she is always trying to drown you
in the ocean of tears.

00:08:21.432 --> 00:08:23.857
But, when she actually drowns you,

00:08:23.881 --> 00:08:25.878
you wake up just a few moments [before],

00:08:25.902 --> 00:08:28.732
and you have a chance to progress again.

00:08:29.432 --> 00:08:31.913
We wanted to show

00:08:31.937 --> 00:08:35.737
that we all go through hardships
in our life, we all do.

00:08:35.761 --> 00:08:41.458
But if you at least, like, stand up
and try to move forward,

00:08:41.482 --> 00:08:46.079
you are very likely to make it
through your struggle,

00:08:46.103 --> 00:08:47.599
step by step.

00:08:49.742 --> 00:08:55.897
Joy is something that Kay
cannot really embrace or touch.

00:08:55.921 --> 00:08:58.675
It's always something in the distance.

00:08:58.699 --> 00:09:01.198
We portrayed Joy
as a child version of Kay,

00:09:01.222 --> 00:09:02.590
with a yellow raincoat,

00:09:02.614 --> 00:09:05.834
so she is invulnerable
to the ocean of tears.

00:09:05.858 --> 00:09:09.101
But Joy can also turn into obsession

00:09:09.125 --> 00:09:11.188
and start to be actually harmful for Kay,

00:09:11.212 --> 00:09:14.284
like when she starts obsessing
over her boyfriend.

00:09:14.974 --> 00:09:20.656
Joy will not turn back to normal
until Kay realizes

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:25.502
that her happiness
should not depend on anybody else

00:09:25.526 --> 00:09:27.700
but herself.

00:09:29.977 --> 00:09:32.904
So our monsters appear huge and scary,

00:09:32.928 --> 00:09:36.203
but if you overcome your reluctance
and approach them,

00:09:36.227 --> 00:09:40.278
you soon see that they
are no monsters at all,

00:09:40.302 --> 00:09:45.603
but just fragile beings that are simply
overwhelmed by what life throws at them.

00:09:48.325 --> 00:09:51.062
All of those emotions,

00:09:51.086 --> 00:09:54.511
be it self-doubt or even self-destruction,

00:09:54.535 --> 00:09:56.838
don't completely vanish in our game.

00:09:58.292 --> 00:10:04.190
The key message is to not only
chase for joy or happiness

00:10:04.214 --> 00:10:07.164
but to embrace all your emotions

00:10:07.188 --> 00:10:09.365
and bring them into balance,

00:10:11.138 --> 00:10:14.934
being OK with sometimes not being OK.

00:10:17.468 --> 00:10:21.099
Everyone has their own
loneliness story to tell.

00:10:21.123 --> 00:10:24.794
This realization changed
everything for me.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.053
Being much more open with my emotions

00:10:28.077 --> 00:10:31.842
and concentrating much more
on my private life,

00:10:31.866 --> 00:10:34.270
my friends, my family.

00:10:35.274 --> 00:10:36.641
When we released the game,

00:10:36.665 --> 00:10:39.985
literally thousands of fans wrote us,

00:10:40.009 --> 00:10:42.606
all sharing their stories with us

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:47.439
and telling us they felt
not so alone anymore

00:10:47.463 --> 00:10:49.796
just because they played our game.

00:10:50.497 --> 00:10:53.419
Many people wrote us that they felt hope

00:10:53.443 --> 00:10:57.102
for a better future for themselves
for the first time in decades.

00:10:57.955 --> 00:11:00.625
Many wrote us that they seek therapy now,

00:11:01.584 --> 00:11:06.054
just because they played our game

00:11:06.078 --> 00:11:09.060
and felt hopeful to overcome
their own struggles.

00:11:11.155 --> 00:11:12.629
Our game is not a therapy.

00:11:12.653 --> 00:11:14.273
It's not meant to be a therapy.

00:11:14.297 --> 00:11:17.217
It's just my friends and me
sharing our stories

00:11:17.241 --> 00:11:19.932
through our art, video games.

00:11:19.956 --> 00:11:24.687
But we are so deeply thankful
for every single message

00:11:24.711 --> 00:11:26.447
that people feel better,

00:11:26.471 --> 00:11:29.999
just because we shared
our story with them.

00:11:31.456 --> 00:11:32.915
So ...

00:11:32.939 --> 00:11:39.932
I didn't completely overcome
my urge to help others.

00:11:39.956 --> 00:11:42.129
But I don't want to overcome it anymore.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.113
I love it.

00:11:44.137 --> 00:11:48.748
I just needed to bring it
to a healthy size,

00:11:48.772 --> 00:11:51.843
so it doesn't stand in the way
of deeper relationships anymore,

00:11:51.867 --> 00:11:54.402
but even help me to connect with people.

00:11:56.264 --> 00:11:59.743
So, if you have an inner monster

00:11:59.767 --> 00:12:03.456
that is born out of negative emotions,

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.915
it is not only the goal
to kill that monster

00:12:06.939 --> 00:12:10.775
but to understand that we humans
are complex beings.

00:12:11.918 --> 00:12:18.173
Look at what part of your life
is so big that others fall short.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.354
Look at what emotions you barely feel

00:12:22.378 --> 00:12:23.928
or maybe feel too much

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:26.541
and move towards lowering those peaks.

00:12:27.191 --> 00:12:29.772
Most of all, it's about understanding

00:12:29.796 --> 00:12:33.500
that all the wide range
of emotions and struggles

00:12:33.524 --> 00:12:35.939
makes us what we are:

00:12:35.963 --> 00:12:37.183
humans.

00:12:38.162 --> 00:12:39.324
Thank you.

00:12:39.348 --> 00:12:41.142
