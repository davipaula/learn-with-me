00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:15.875
[This talk contains mature content
Viewer discretion is advised]

00:00:16.825 --> 00:00:21.309
My specialty, as a sex educator,
is I bring the science.

00:00:22.076 --> 00:00:26.117
But my first and most important job
is that I stay neutral

00:00:26.141 --> 00:00:28.506
when I talk about anything sex-related,

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.752
no embarrassment, no titillation,
no judgment, no shame,

00:00:32.776 --> 00:00:34.109
no matter where I am.

00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:37.529
No matter what question you ask me.

00:00:38.347 --> 00:00:40.696
At the end of a conference
in a hotel lobby once,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.935
I'm literally on my way out the door
and a colleague chases me down.

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:46.164
"Emily, I just have
a really quick question.

00:00:47.061 --> 00:00:48.418
A friend of mine --

00:00:48.442 --> 00:00:49.593
(Laughter)

00:00:49.617 --> 00:00:53.100
wants to know if it's possible
to get addicted to her vibrator."

00:00:54.085 --> 00:00:57.323
The answer is no,
but it is possible to get spoiled.

00:00:58.284 --> 00:01:01.545
A different conference,
this one in an outdoor tropical paradise,

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:04.631
I'm at the breakfast buffet,
and a couple approaches me.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.449
"Hi, Emily, we're sorry to interrupt you

00:01:07.473 --> 00:01:12.267
but we just wanted to ask a quick question
about premature ejaculation."

00:01:13.092 --> 00:01:16.093
"Sure, let me tell you
about the stop/start technique."

00:01:17.025 --> 00:01:18.176
That is my life.

00:01:18.526 --> 00:01:22.176
I stay neutral when
other people might "squick."

00:01:22.534 --> 00:01:26.100
Squick is an emotion
that combines surprise

00:01:26.124 --> 00:01:29.082
with embarrassment plus some disgust

00:01:29.106 --> 00:01:31.926
and like, not knowing
what to do with your hands.

00:01:33.688 --> 00:01:35.302
So, it's a product.

00:01:35.326 --> 00:01:36.680
The reason you experience it

00:01:36.704 --> 00:01:39.291
is because you spent
the first two decades of your life

00:01:39.315 --> 00:01:43.490
learning that sex is a dangerous
and disgusting source of everlasting shame

00:01:43.514 --> 00:01:46.958
and if you're not really good at it,
no one will ever love you.

00:01:46.982 --> 00:01:48.672
(Laughter)

00:01:48.696 --> 00:01:51.458
So you might squick,
hearing me talk about sex

00:01:51.482 --> 00:01:54.625
while you're sitting in a room
full of strangers -- that is normal.

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:55.990
I invite you to breathe.

00:01:56.014 --> 00:01:57.569
Feelings are tunnels.

00:01:57.593 --> 00:02:00.792
We make our way through the darkness
to get to the light at the end.

00:02:00.816 --> 00:02:02.164
And I promise it's worth it.

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:04.887
Because I want to share with you
today a piece of science

00:02:04.911 --> 00:02:07.252
that has changed
how I think about everything,

00:02:07.276 --> 00:02:11.022
from the behavior of neurotransmitters
in our emotional brain,

00:02:11.046 --> 00:02:14.512
to the dynamics of our
interpersonal relationships.

00:02:14.966 --> 00:02:16.601
To our judicial system.

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:19.141
And it starts with our brain.

00:02:19.165 --> 00:02:22.149
There's an area of your brain
you've probably heard referred to

00:02:22.173 --> 00:02:23.562
as the "reward center."

00:02:23.586 --> 00:02:25.324
I think calling it the reward center

00:02:25.348 --> 00:02:27.783
is a little bit like calling
your face your nose.

00:02:27.807 --> 00:02:30.276
That is one prominent feature,

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.156
but it ignores some other parts
and will leave you really confused

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.743
if you're trying to understand
how faces work.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.560
It's actually three intertwined
but separable systems.

00:02:40.584 --> 00:02:42.395
The first system is liking.

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:43.571
Which is like reward,

00:02:43.595 --> 00:02:46.205
so this is the opioid hotspots
in your emotional brain.

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:48.705
It assesses hedonic impact --

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:50.269
"Does this stimulus feel good?

00:02:50.293 --> 00:02:51.454
How good?

00:02:51.478 --> 00:02:53.037
Does this stimulus feel bad?

00:02:53.061 --> 00:02:54.235
How bad?"

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:57.006
If you drop sugar water
on the tongue of a newborn infant,

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.030
the opioid-liking system
sets off fireworks.

00:03:00.682 --> 00:03:02.420
And then there's the wanting system.

00:03:02.444 --> 00:03:06.238
Wanting is mediated
by this vast dopaminergic network

00:03:06.262 --> 00:03:08.318
in and beyond the emotional brain.

00:03:08.342 --> 00:03:12.615
It motivates us to move toward
or away from a stimulus.

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:15.975
Wanting is more like your toddler,
following you around,

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:17.546
asking for another cookie.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.770
So wanting and liking are related.

00:03:20.221 --> 00:03:21.625
They are not identical.

00:03:21.974 --> 00:03:24.149
And the third system is learning.

00:03:24.173 --> 00:03:25.704
Learning is Pavlov's dogs.

00:03:25.728 --> 00:03:27.062
You remember Pavlov?

00:03:27.086 --> 00:03:29.204
He makes dogs salivate
in response to a bell.

00:03:29.228 --> 00:03:31.891
It's easy, you give a dog food,
salivates automatically,

00:03:31.915 --> 00:03:33.090
and you ring a bell.

00:03:33.114 --> 00:03:34.274
Food, salivate, bell.

00:03:34.298 --> 00:03:35.871
Food, bell, salivate.

00:03:35.895 --> 00:03:37.307
Bell, salivate.

00:03:38.656 --> 00:03:42.764
Does that salivation mean
that the dog wants to eat the bell?

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:47.513
Does it mean that the dog
finds the bell delicious?

00:03:48.322 --> 00:03:49.474
No.

00:03:49.498 --> 00:03:53.621
What Pavlov did
was make the bell food-related.

00:03:54.522 --> 00:03:58.006
When we see this separateness
of wanting, liking and learning,

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.665
this is where we find
an explanatory framework

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.657
for understanding what researchers call
arousal nonconcordance.

00:04:04.681 --> 00:04:06.244
Nonconcordance, very simply,

00:04:06.268 --> 00:04:08.910
is when there is a lack
of predictive relationship

00:04:08.934 --> 00:04:11.895
between your physiological
response, like salivation,

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:15.225
and your subjective experience
of pleasure and desire.

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:20.720
That happens in every emotional
and motivational system that we have,

00:04:20.744 --> 00:04:21.894
including sex.

00:04:22.378 --> 00:04:23.864
Research over the last 30 years

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:26.604
has found that genital
blood flow can increase

00:04:26.628 --> 00:04:29.450
in response to sex-related stimuli

00:04:29.474 --> 00:04:32.505
even if those sex-related stimuli
are not also associated

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:35.649
with the subjective experience
of wanting and liking.

00:04:35.673 --> 00:04:37.768
In fact, the predictive relationship

00:04:37.792 --> 00:04:40.149
between genital response
and subjective experience

00:04:40.173 --> 00:04:43.743
is between 10 and 50 percent.

00:04:43.767 --> 00:04:46.729
Which is an enormous range.

00:04:46.753 --> 00:04:50.159
You just can't predict necessarily

00:04:50.183 --> 00:04:53.219
how a person feels
about that sex-related stimulus

00:04:53.243 --> 00:04:55.418
just by looking
at their genital blood flow.

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:59.338
When I explained this to my husband,
he gave me the best possible example.

00:04:59.362 --> 00:05:00.544
He was like,

00:05:00.568 --> 00:05:04.609
"So, that could explain this one time,
when I was in high school, I ...

00:05:04.633 --> 00:05:07.664
I got an erection in response
to the phrase 'doughnut hole.'"

00:05:07.688 --> 00:05:09.180
(Laughter)

00:05:09.204 --> 00:05:11.204
Did he want to have sex with the doughnut?

00:05:11.744 --> 00:05:12.902
No.

00:05:12.926 --> 00:05:15.895
He was a teenage boy
flooded with testosterone,

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.728
which makes everything
a little bit sex-related.

00:05:18.752 --> 00:05:20.339
And it can go in both directions.

00:05:20.363 --> 00:05:23.982
A person with a penis may struggle
to get an erection one evening,

00:05:24.006 --> 00:05:26.641
and then wake up the very next
morning with an erection,

00:05:26.665 --> 00:05:28.731
when it's nothing but a hassle.

00:05:29.284 --> 00:05:31.887
I got a phone call from
a 30-something friend, a woman,

00:05:31.911 --> 00:05:35.325
she said, "So, my partner and I
were in the middle of doing some things

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:37.247
and I was like, 'I want you right now.'

00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:41.318
And he said, 'No, you're still dry,
you're just being nice.'

00:05:42.108 --> 00:05:43.609
And I was so ready.

00:05:43.633 --> 00:05:46.649
So what's the matter, is it hormonal,
should I talk to a doctor,

00:05:46.673 --> 00:05:47.853
what's going on?"

00:05:47.877 --> 00:05:49.052
Answer?

00:05:49.076 --> 00:05:50.513
It's arousal nonconcordance.

00:05:50.537 --> 00:05:53.945
If you're experiencing unwanted pain,
talk to a medical provider.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.307
Otherwise -- arousal nonconcordance.

00:05:56.331 --> 00:05:59.315
Your genital behavior
just doesn't necessarily predict

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:02.590
your subjective experience
of liking and wanting.

00:06:02.614 --> 00:06:04.138
Another friend, back in college,

00:06:04.162 --> 00:06:07.702
told me about her first experiences
of power play in a sexual relationship.

00:06:07.726 --> 00:06:09.662
She told me that her partner tied her up

00:06:09.686 --> 00:06:13.331
with her arms over her head like this,
she's standing up and he positions her

00:06:13.355 --> 00:06:16.760
so she's straddling a bar, presses up
against her clitoris, like this.

00:06:16.784 --> 00:06:19.490
So there's my friend, standing there,
and the guy leaves.

00:06:19.514 --> 00:06:20.720
It's a power play.

00:06:20.744 --> 00:06:21.895
Leaves her alone.

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.212
So there's my friend, and she goes,

00:06:24.236 --> 00:06:25.434
"I'm bored."

00:06:25.458 --> 00:06:26.673
(Laughter)

00:06:26.697 --> 00:06:29.759
And the guy comes back
and she says, "I am bored."

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:32.586
And he looks at her
and he looks at the bar

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.013
and he says, "Then why are you wet?"

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:37.279
Why was she wet?

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.431
Is it sex-related to have pressure
directly against your clitoris?

00:06:42.455 --> 00:06:43.613
Yeah.

00:06:43.637 --> 00:06:46.843
Does that tell him whether
she wants or likes what's happening?

00:06:47.835 --> 00:06:49.168
Nope.

00:06:49.192 --> 00:06:52.745
What does tell him whether
she wants or likes what's happening?

00:06:54.216 --> 00:06:55.375
She does!

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:59.141
She recognized and articulated
what she wanted and liked.

00:06:59.471 --> 00:07:02.423
All he had to do was listen to her words.

00:07:02.447 --> 00:07:05.804
My friend on the phone --
what's the solution?

00:07:05.828 --> 00:07:09.137
You tell your partner,
"Listen to your words."

00:07:09.498 --> 00:07:10.831
Also, buy some lube.

00:07:11.561 --> 00:07:13.490
(Laughter)

00:07:13.514 --> 00:07:14.950
(Applause)

00:07:14.974 --> 00:07:16.845
Applause for lube, absolutely.

00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:18.299
(Applause)

00:07:18.323 --> 00:07:19.723
Everyone, everywhere.

00:07:20.855 --> 00:07:23.903
But I want to tell you a darker
listen-to-her-words story.

00:07:23.927 --> 00:07:26.450
This one comes from a note
that a student sent me

00:07:26.474 --> 00:07:28.974
after I gave a lecture
about arousal nonconcordance.

00:07:28.998 --> 00:07:32.403
She was with a partner,
a new partner, glad to be doing things,

00:07:32.427 --> 00:07:33.578
and they reached a point

00:07:33.602 --> 00:07:36.048
where that was as far
as she was interested in going

00:07:36.072 --> 00:07:37.223
and so she said no.

00:07:37.247 --> 00:07:41.332
And the partner said, "No, you're wet,
you're so ready, don't be shy."

00:07:42.434 --> 00:07:43.584
Shy?

00:07:43.927 --> 00:07:47.395
As if it hadn't taken all the courage
and confidence she had

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:49.577
to say no to someone she liked.

00:07:49.926 --> 00:07:52.160
Whose feelings she did not want to hurt.

00:07:52.942 --> 00:07:54.409
But she said it again.

00:07:55.355 --> 00:07:56.505
She said no.

00:07:57.728 --> 00:07:59.528
Did he listen to her words?

00:08:01.768 --> 00:08:05.855
In the age of Me Too
and Time's Up, people ask me,

00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:08.331
"How do I even know
what my partner wants and likes?

00:08:08.355 --> 00:08:10.823
Is all consent to be verbal
and contractual now?"

00:08:10.847 --> 00:08:12.841
There are times when consent is ambiguous

00:08:12.865 --> 00:08:16.977
and we need a large-scale
cultural conversation about that.

00:08:17.001 --> 00:08:20.990
But can we make sure we're noticing
how clear consent is

00:08:21.014 --> 00:08:23.101
if we eliminate this myth?

00:08:23.125 --> 00:08:25.315
In every example I've described so far,

00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:29.172
one partner recognized and articulated
what they wanted and liked:

00:08:29.196 --> 00:08:31.006
"I want you right now."

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:32.180
"No."

00:08:32.657 --> 00:08:34.794
And their partner told them
they were wrong.

00:08:35.612 --> 00:08:37.017
It's gaslighting.

00:08:37.041 --> 00:08:39.136
Profound and degrading.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.379
You say you feel one way,

00:08:40.403 --> 00:08:43.601
but your body proves
that you feel something else.

00:08:43.625 --> 00:08:46.196
And we only do this around sexuality,

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.696
because arousal nonconcordance

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.586
happens with every emotional
and motivational system we have.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:54.895
If my mouth waters
when I bite into a wormy apple,

00:08:54.919 --> 00:08:56.649
does anybody say to me,

00:08:56.673 --> 00:08:59.260
"You said no, but your body said yes?"

00:08:59.284 --> 00:09:00.966
(Laughter)

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.378
And it's not only our partners
who get it wrong.

00:09:03.823 --> 00:09:06.676
The National Judicial Education Program
published a document

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:11.172
called "Judges Tell: What I Wish
I Had Known Before I Presided

00:09:11.196 --> 00:09:13.771
in a Case of an Adult Victim
of Sexual Assault."

00:09:14.434 --> 00:09:15.720
Number 13:

00:09:15.744 --> 00:09:20.053
On occasion, the victim, female or male,
may experience a physical response,

00:09:20.077 --> 00:09:24.291
but this is not a sexual response
in the sense of desire or mutuality."

00:09:24.315 --> 00:09:26.625
This brings me one step closer
into the darkness,

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:29.252
and then I promise
we will find our way into the light.

00:09:29.276 --> 00:09:32.284
I'm thinking of a recent court case
involving multiple instances

00:09:32.308 --> 00:09:34.125
of non-consensual sexual contact.

00:09:34.149 --> 00:09:35.871
Imagine you're on the jury

00:09:35.895 --> 00:09:38.695
and you learn that the victim had orgasms.

00:09:39.403 --> 00:09:41.773
Does it change how your gut
responds to the case?

00:09:42.735 --> 00:09:44.751
Let me remind you,
orgasm is physiological;

00:09:44.775 --> 00:09:47.219
it is a spontaneous,
involuntary release of tension,

00:09:47.243 --> 00:09:50.116
generated in response
to sex-related stimuli.

00:09:51.434 --> 00:09:55.529
But the perpetrator’s lawyer made sure
the jury knew about those orgasms

00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:59.064
because he thought the orgasms
could be construed as consent.

00:10:00.674 --> 00:10:04.340
I will also add that this was a child
being abused by an adult in the family.

00:10:04.674 --> 00:10:06.274
I invite you to breathe.

00:10:06.682 --> 00:10:09.459
That kind of story can give a person
all kind of feelings,

00:10:09.483 --> 00:10:13.062
from rage to shame to confused arousal

00:10:13.086 --> 00:10:14.990
because it is sex-related,

00:10:15.014 --> 00:10:17.267
even though it is appalling.

00:10:19.069 --> 00:10:21.760
But even though I know it's difficult

00:10:21.784 --> 00:10:24.371
to sit with those feelings
in a room full of strangers,

00:10:24.395 --> 00:10:27.664
if we can find our way through
all of the messy feelings,

00:10:27.688 --> 00:10:32.220
I believe we will find our way
to the light of compassion

00:10:32.244 --> 00:10:34.244
for that child,

00:10:34.268 --> 00:10:36.832
whose relationship
with her body was damaged

00:10:36.856 --> 00:10:39.354
by an adult whose job it was
to protect it.

00:10:40.561 --> 00:10:44.656
And we'll find hope
that there was a trustworthy adult

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.410
who could say, "Genital response

00:10:46.434 --> 00:10:50.133
just means it was a sex-related stimulus;
doesn't mean it was wanted or liked,

00:10:50.157 --> 00:10:52.228
certainly doesn't mean
it was consented to.

00:10:53.124 --> 00:10:58.254
(Applause)

00:10:58.278 --> 00:11:03.276
That compassion and that hope
are why I travel all over,

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.410
talking about this
to anyone who will listen.

00:11:05.434 --> 00:11:09.402
I can see it helping people,
even as I say the words.

00:11:11.354 --> 00:11:14.385
I invite you to say the words.

00:11:15.544 --> 00:11:18.472
You don't have to say "clitoris"
in front of 1000 strangers.

00:11:18.783 --> 00:11:22.282
But do have one brave conversation.

00:11:22.306 --> 00:11:25.497
Tell this to someone you know
who has experienced sexual violence --

00:11:25.521 --> 00:11:26.855
you definitely know someone.

00:11:26.879 --> 00:11:29.053
In the US it's one in three women.

00:11:29.077 --> 00:11:30.966
One in six men.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.656
Almost half of transgender folks.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.022
Say "Genital response means
it's a sex-related stimulus.

00:11:37.046 --> 00:11:39.045
It doesn't mean it was wanted or liked."

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:42.309
Say it to a judge you know
or a lawyer you know,

00:11:42.333 --> 00:11:46.232
or a cop or anyone who might sit
on a jury in a sexual assault case.

00:11:46.256 --> 00:11:48.844
Say "Some people think
that your body doesn't respond

00:11:48.868 --> 00:11:51.482
if you don't want
or like what's happening,

00:11:51.506 --> 00:11:52.903
if only that were true.

00:11:52.927 --> 00:11:55.561
Instead, arousal nonconcordance.

00:11:55.585 --> 00:11:58.863
Say this to the confused
teenager in your life

00:11:58.887 --> 00:12:02.925
who is just trying to figure out
what, even, what?

00:12:03.244 --> 00:12:08.871
Say, if you bite this moldy fruit
and your mouth waters,

00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:10.268
nobody would say to you,

00:12:10.292 --> 00:12:13.537
"Well, you just don't want to admit
how much you like it."

00:12:13.561 --> 00:12:16.624
Same goes for down below,
arousal nonconcordance.

00:12:17.387 --> 00:12:18.920
Say it to your partner.

00:12:19.244 --> 00:12:22.086
My genitals do not tell you
what I want or like.

00:12:22.823 --> 00:12:23.973
I do.

00:12:24.813 --> 00:12:30.247
(Applause)

00:12:30.271 --> 00:12:31.763
The roots of this myth are deep

00:12:31.787 --> 00:12:35.064
and they are entangled with some
very dark forces in our culture.

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:38.633
But with every brave conversation we have,

00:12:38.657 --> 00:12:41.395
we make the world
that little bit better, a little simpler

00:12:41.419 --> 00:12:43.152
for the confused teenager.

00:12:43.458 --> 00:12:46.902
A little easier for your friend
on the phone, worried that she's broken.

00:12:48.363 --> 00:12:51.235
A little easier and safer

00:12:51.259 --> 00:12:53.902
for the survivors, one in three women.

00:12:53.926 --> 00:12:55.076
One in six men.

00:12:55.648 --> 00:12:57.581
Half of trans folks.

00:12:58.633 --> 00:12:59.783
Me too.

00:13:00.514 --> 00:13:02.978
So for every brave conversation you have,

00:13:04.601 --> 00:13:05.752
thank you.

00:13:05.776 --> 00:13:12.720
(Applause)

00:13:13.268 --> 00:13:14.418
Thank you.

00:13:15.379 --> 00:13:16.561
Thanks.

00:13:16.585 --> 00:13:19.760
(Applause)

00:13:20.232 --> 00:13:22.065
Helen Walters: Emily, come up here.

00:13:22.089 --> 00:13:23.335
Thank you so much.

00:13:23.645 --> 00:13:25.473
I know that you do this all the time,

00:13:25.497 --> 00:13:28.823
and yet, still, I'm so grateful to you
for having the courage

00:13:28.847 --> 00:13:30.863
to come and talk about that on this stage.

00:13:30.887 --> 00:13:33.331
It really took a lot
and we're very grateful to you.

00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:34.533
So thank you.

00:13:34.557 --> 00:13:36.474
Emily Nagoski: I am grateful to be here.

00:13:36.498 --> 00:13:38.101
HW: So in your regular day job,

00:13:38.125 --> 00:13:40.221
I imagine, as you put
at the top of the talk,

00:13:40.245 --> 00:13:41.839
you get asked a lot of questions.

00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:45.474
But what's the one question
that you get asked all the time

00:13:45.498 --> 00:13:50.006
that you can share with everyone here
so you don't have to answer it 1000 times

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.569
throughout the rest of the week?

00:13:51.895 --> 00:13:53.791
EN: The question I get asked most often

00:13:53.815 --> 00:13:57.220
is actually the question underneath
pretty much all the other questions,

00:13:57.244 --> 00:13:59.283
so, can you get addicted to your vibrator,

00:13:59.307 --> 00:14:01.387
please help me
with my erectile dysfunction?

00:14:01.411 --> 00:14:04.513
Underneath every question is actually
the question, "Am I normal?"

00:14:04.839 --> 00:14:07.220
To which my answer in my mind is,

00:14:07.244 --> 00:14:11.436
what even is normal and why is that
what you want your sexuality to be?

00:14:11.942 --> 00:14:14.283
Why do we only want to be normal
around sexuality?

00:14:14.307 --> 00:14:16.156
Don't we want to be extraordinary?

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.990
Like, do you just want normal sex
or do you want awesome sex in your life?

00:14:20.014 --> 00:14:22.474
I think, though, there's a lot of fear

00:14:22.498 --> 00:14:24.665
around being too different sexually.

00:14:24.689 --> 00:14:26.228
When people are asking me,

00:14:26.252 --> 00:14:28.173
"Is this thing I'm experiencing normal,"

00:14:28.197 --> 00:14:31.594
what they're actually
asking me is, "Do I belong?"

00:14:31.998 --> 00:14:33.919
Do I belong in this relationship,

00:14:33.943 --> 00:14:36.418
do I belong in this community of people,

00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:39.154
do I belong on earth as a sexual person?

00:14:39.178 --> 00:14:43.140
To which the answer is always
a resounding yes.

00:14:43.164 --> 00:14:47.187
The only barrier there is,
the only limit there is, there are two:

00:14:47.211 --> 00:14:50.346
one, if you're experiencing
unwanted sexual pain,

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:51.672
talk to a medical provider.

00:14:51.696 --> 00:14:56.045
And two: As along as everybody involved
is free and glad to be there,

00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:57.991
and free to leave whenever they want to,

00:14:58.015 --> 00:15:00.704
you're allowed to do
anything that you want to.

00:15:00.728 --> 00:15:03.553
There is no script,
there is no box you have to fit into,

00:15:03.577 --> 00:15:07.127
you're allowed, as long as there is
consent and no unwanted pain,

00:15:07.151 --> 00:15:09.761
you're totally free to do
whatever you want.

00:15:09.785 --> 00:15:11.378
HW: Amazing. Thank you so much.

00:15:11.402 --> 00:15:12.574
EN: Thank you.

00:15:12.598 --> 00:15:14.262
HW: Thank you, you're incredible.

00:15:14.286 --> 00:15:15.436
(Applause)
