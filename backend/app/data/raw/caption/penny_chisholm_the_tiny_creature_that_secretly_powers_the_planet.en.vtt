00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.600
I'd like to introduce you
to a tiny microorganism

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.616
that you've probably never heard of:

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.616
its name is Prochlorococcus,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.840
and it's really an amazing little being.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.576
For one thing, its ancestors

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.416
changed the earth in ways
that made it possible for us to evolve,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.496
and hidden in its genetic code

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.296
is a blueprint

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.600
that may inspire ways to reduce
our dependency on fossil fuel.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.336
But the most amazing thing

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.976
is that there are
three billion billion billion

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.816
of these tiny cells on the planet,

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.160
and we didn't know they existed
until 35 years ago.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.736
So to tell you their story,

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.000
I need to first take you way back,

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.420
four billion years ago, when the earth
might have looked something like this.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.336
There was no life on the planet,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.640
there was no oxygen in the atmosphere.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.976
So what happened to change that planet
into the one we enjoy today,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.816
teeming with life,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.480
teeming with plants and animals?

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.760
Well, in a word, photosynthesis.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.176
About two and a half billion years ago,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.136
some of these ancient ancestors
of Prochlorococcus evolved

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.496
so that they could use solar energy

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.816
and absorb it

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.856
and split water into its component parts
of oxygen and hydrogen.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.296
And they used the chemical energy produced

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.216
to draw CO2, carbon dioxide,
out of the atmosphere

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.056
and use it to build sugars
and proteins and amino acids,

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.480
all the things that life is made of.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.656
And as they evolved and grew more and more

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.736
over millions and millions of years,

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.840
that oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.976
Until about 500 million years ago,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.696
there was enough in the atmosphere
that larger organisms could evolve.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.656
There was an explosion of life-forms,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.240
and, ultimately, we appeared on the scene.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.320
While that was going on,

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.656
some of those ancient
photosynthesizers died

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.360
and were compressed and buried,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.256
and became fossil fuel

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.416
with sunlight buried
in their carbon bonds.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.120
They're basically buried sunlight
in the form of coal and oil.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.656
Today's photosynthesizers,

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.336
their engines are descended
from those ancient microbes,

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.600
and they feed basically
all of life on earth.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.776
Your heart is beating
using the solar energy

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.016
that some plant processed for you,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.456
and the stuff your body is made out of

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.096
is made out of CO2

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.560
that some plant processed for you.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.760
Basically, we're all made
out of sunlight and carbon dioxide.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.696
Fundamentally, we're just hot air.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.040
(Laughter)

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.256
So as terrestrial beings,

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.336
we're very familiar
with the plants on land:

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.976
the trees, the grasses,
the pastures, the crops.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.816
But the oceans are filled
with billions of tons of animals.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.200
Do you ever wonder what's feeding them?

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.776
Well there's an invisible pasture

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.576
of microscopic photosynthesizers
called phytoplankton

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.240
that fill the upper
200 meters of the ocean,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.416
and they feed the entire
open ocean ecosystem.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.856
Some of the animals
live among them and eat them,

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.416
and others swim up
to feed on them at night,

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.416
while others sit in the deep
and wait for them to die and settle down

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.964
and then they chow down on them.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.416
So these tiny phytoplankton,

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.576
collectively, weigh less than
one percent of all the plants on land,

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.896
but annually they photosynthesize
as much as all of the plants on land,

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.336
including the Amazon rainforest

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.560
that we consider the lungs of the planet.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.256
Every year, they fix
50 billion tons of carbon

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.536
in the form of carbon dioxide
into their bodies

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.240
that feeds the ocean ecosystem.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.696
How does this tiny amount of biomass

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.776
produce as much as all the plants on land?

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.336
Well, they don't have trunks and stems

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.296
and flowers and fruits
and all that to maintain.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.136
All they have to do is grow and divide
and grow and divide.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.760
They're really lean
little photosynthesis machines.

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:34.720
They really crank.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.296
So there are thousands
of different species of phytoplankton,

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.496
come in all different shapes and sizes,

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.776
all roughly less than the width
of a human hair.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.376
Here, I'm showing you
some of the more beautiful ones,

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.880
the textbook versions.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.880
I call them the charismatic
species of phytoplankton.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.120
And here is Prochlorococcus.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.656
I know,

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.616
it just looks like a bunch
of schmutz on a microscope slide.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.216
(Laughter)

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.056
But they're in there,

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.840
and I'm going to reveal them
to you in a minute.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.120
But first I want to tell you
how they were discovered.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.216
About 38 years ago,

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.016
we were playing around with a technology
in my lab called flow cytometry

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.520
that was developed for biomedical research
for studying cells like cancer cells,

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.376
but it turns out we were using it
for this off-label purpose

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.360
which was to study phytoplankton,
and it was beautifully suited to do that.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.256
And here's how it works:

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.520
so you inject a sample
in this tiny little capillary tube,

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.336
and the cells go single file by a laser,

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.416
and as they do, they scatter light
according to their size

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.096
and they emit light according
to whatever pigments they might have,

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.736
whether they're natural
or whether you stain them.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.120
And the chlorophyl of phytoplankton,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.496
which is green,

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.256
emits red light
when you shine blue light on it.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.496
And so we used this instrument
for several years

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.336
to study our phytoplankton cultures,

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.976
species like those charismatic
ones that I showed you,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.200
just studying their basic cell biology.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.096
But all that time, we thought,
well wouldn't it be really cool

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.936
if we could take an instrument
like this out on a ship

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.656
and just squirt seawater through it

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.416
and see what all those diversity
of phytoplankton would look like.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.536
So I managed to get my hands

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.776
on what we call a big rig
in flow cytometry,

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.240
a large, powerful laser

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.976
with a money-back guarantee
from the company

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.936
that if it didn't work on a ship,
they would take it back.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.976
And so a young scientist
that I was working with at the time,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.576
Rob Olson, was able
to take this thing apart,

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.456
put it on a ship, put it back together
and take it off to sea.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.816
And it worked like a charm.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.976
We didn't think it would,
because we thought the ship's vibrations

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.376
would get in the way
of the focusing of the laser,

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.056
but it really worked like a charm.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.576
And so we mapped the phytoplankton
distributions across the ocean.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.216
For the first time, you could look at them
one cell at a time in real time

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.056
and see what was going on --
that was very exciting.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.096
But one day, Rob noticed
some faint signals

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.616
coming out of the instrument

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.336
that we dismissed as electronic noise

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.656
for probably a year

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.016
before we realized that it wasn't
really behaving like noise.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.200
It had some regular patterns to it.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.880
To make a long story short,

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.176
it was tiny, tiny little cells,

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.576
less than one-one hundredth
the width of a human hair

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.416
that contain chlorophyl.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.800
That was Prochlorococcus.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.800
So remember this slide that I showed you?

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.296
If you shine blue light
on that same sample,

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.520
this is what you see:

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.136
two tiny little red light-emitting cells.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.280
Those are Prochlorococcus.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.800
They are the smallest and most abundant
photosynthetic cell on the planet.

00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:10.976
At first, we didn't know what they were,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.776
so we called the "little greens."

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.776
It was a very affectionate name for them.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.416
Ultimately, we knew enough about them
to give them the name Prochlorococcus,

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.656
which means "primitive green berry."

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.120
And it was about that time

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.256
that I became so smitten
by these little cells

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.400
that I redirected my entire lab
to study them and nothing else,

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.776
and my loyalty to them
has really paid off.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.360
They've given me a tremendous amount,
including bringing me here.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:45.240
(Applause)

00:08:45.799 --> 00:08:48.775
So over the years,
we and others, many others,

00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:52.176
have studied Prochlorococcus
across the oceans

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:56.776
and found that they're very abundant
over wide, wide ranges

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.440
in the open ocean ecosystem.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.776
They're particularly abundant
in what are called the open ocean gyres.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.536
These are sometimes referred to
as the deserts of the oceans,

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.576
but they're not deserts at all.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.136
Their deep blue water is teeming

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.560
with a hundred million
Prochlorococcus cells per liter.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.976
If you crowd them together
like we do in our cultures,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.536
you can see their beautiful
green chlorophyl.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.176
One of those test tubes
has a billion Prochlorococcus in it,

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.656
and as I told you earlier,

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.856
there are three billion billion billion
of them on the planet.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.096
That's three octillion,

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.800
if you care to convert.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.176
(Laughter)

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.096
And collectively, they weigh
more than the human population

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.080
and they photosynthesize
as much as all of the crops on land.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.520
They're incredibly important
in the global ocean.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.616
So over the years,
as we were studying them

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.816
and found how abundant they were,

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.776
we thought, hmm, this is really strange.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.640
How can a single species be so abundant
across so many different habitats?

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.656
And as we isolated more into culture,

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.816
we learned that they
are different ecotypes.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.736
There are some that are adapted
to the high-light intensities

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.016
in the surface water,

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.616
and there are some that are adapted
to the low light in the deep ocean.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.216
In fact, those cells that live
in the bottom of the sunlit zone

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:23.016
are the most efficient
photosynthesizers of any known cell.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.376
And then we learned
that there are some strains

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.816
that grow optimally along the equator,

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.576
where there are higher temperatures,

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.976
and some that do better
at the cooler temperatures

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.256
as you go north and south.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.976
So as we studied these more and more
and kept finding more and more diversity,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.440
we thought, oh my God,
how diverse are these things?

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.296
And about that time, it became
possible to sequence their genomes

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.920
and really look under the hood
and look at their genetic makeup.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:53.696
And we've been able to sequence
the genomes of cultures that we have,

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.096
but also recently, using flow cytometry,

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.976
we can isolate
individual cells from the wild

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.176
and sequence their individual genomes,

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.080
and now we've sequenced
hundreds of Prochlorococcus.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.776
And although each cell
has roughly 2,000 genes --

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.376
that's one tenth the size
of the human genome --

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.856
as you sequence more and more,

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:18.576
you find that they only have
a thousand of those in common

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.696
and the other thousand
for each individual strain

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.296
is drawn from an enormous gene pool,

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:30.936
and it reflects the particular environment
that the cell might have thrived in,

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.936
not just high or low light
or high or low temperature,

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.736
but whether there are
nutrients that limit them

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.216
like nitrogen, phosphorus or iron.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.760
It reflects the habitat
that they come from.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.600
Think of it this way.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.296
If each cell is a smartphone

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.240
and the apps are the genes,

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.536
when you get your smartphone,
it comes with these built-in apps.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.776
Those are the ones that you can't delete
if you're an iPhone person.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.856
You press on them and they don't jiggle
and they don't have x's.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.496
Even if you don't want them,
you can't get rid of them.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.096
(Laughter)

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.256
Those are like the core genes
of Prochlorococcus.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.336
They're the essence of the phone.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:16.336
But you have a huge pool
of apps to draw upon

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:22.096
to make your phone custom-designed
for your particular lifestyle and habitat.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.936
If you travel a lot,
you'll have a lot of travel apps,

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:30.776
if you're into financial things,
you might have a lot of financial apps,

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.336
or if you're like me,

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.296
you probably have a lot of weather apps,

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.936
hoping one of them will tell you
what you want to hear.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.296
(Laughter)

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.696
And I've learned the last
couple days in Vancouver

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.696
that you don't need a weather app --
you just need an umbrella.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.936
So --

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.136
(Laughter)

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.856
(Applause)

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:55.816
So just as your smartphone tells us
something about how you live your life,

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.136
your lifestyle,

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.776
reading the genome
of a Prochlorococcus cell

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.840
tells us what the pressures are
in its environment.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.656
It's like reading its diary,

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.456
not only telling us how it got
through its day or its week,

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.160
but even its evolutionary history.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.416
As we studied -- I said we've
sequenced hundreds of these cells,

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.296
and we can now project

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:23.456
what is the total genetic size --

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.696
gene pool --

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.216
of the Prochlorococcus
federation, as we call it.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.896
It's like a superorganism.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.536
And it turns out that projections are

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.576
that the collective has 80,000 genes.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.536
That's four times the size
of the human genome.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.976
And it's that diversity of gene pools

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.016
that makes it possible for them

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.296
to dominate these large
regions of the oceans

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.056
and maintain their stability

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.000
year in and year out.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.856
So when I daydream about Prochlorococcus,

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.336
which I probably do more
than is healthy --

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.056
(Laughter)

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.456
I imagine them floating out there,

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.776
doing their job,

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.336
maintaining the planet,

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.536
feeding the animals.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.736
But also I inevitably end up

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.176
thinking about what
a masterpiece they are,

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.096
finely tuned by millions
of years of evolution.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.120
With 2,000 genes,

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.416
they can do what
all of our human ingenuity

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.696
has not figured out how to do yet.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.696
They can take solar energy, CO2

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.216
and turn it into chemical energy
in the form of organic carbon,

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.520
locking that sunlight
in those carbon bonds.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:41.296
If we could figure out
exactly how they do this,

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.336
it could inspire designs

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.296
that could reduce
our dependency on fossil fuels,

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.120
which brings my story full circle.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.056
The fossil fuels that are buried
that we're burning

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.896
took millions of years
for the earth to bury those,

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.936
including those ancestors
of Prochlorococcus,

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.856
and we're burning that now
in the blink of an eye

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.816
on geological timescales.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.736
Carbon dioxide is increasing
in the atmosphere.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.336
It's a greenhouse gas.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.456
The oceans are starting to warm.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.216
So the question is,
what is that going to do

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.736
for my Prochlorococcus?

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:23.696
And I'm sure you're expecting me to say
that my beloved microbes are doomed,

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.040
but in fact they're not.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:31.616
Projections are that their populations
will expand as the ocean warms

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.520
to 30 percent larger by the year 2100.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.400
Does that make me happy?

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.976
Well, it makes me happy
for Prochlorococcus of course --

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.296
(Laughter)

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.720
but not for the planet.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.856
There are winners and losers

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.136
in this global experiment
that we've undertaken,

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.136
and it's projected that among the losers

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.216
will be some of those
larger phytoplankton,

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.536
those charismatic ones

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.376
which are expected
to be reduced in numbers,

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.896
and they're the ones that feed
the zooplankton that feed the fish

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.320
that we like to harvest.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:13.056
So Prochlorococcus has been
my muse for the past 35 years,

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.456
but there are legions
of other microbes out there

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.640
maintaining our planet for us.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.416
They're out there

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:24.696
ready and waiting for us to find them
so they can tell their stories, too.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.936
Thank you.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:31.560
(Applause)
