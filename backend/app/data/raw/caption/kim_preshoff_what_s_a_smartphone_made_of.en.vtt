00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:13.502
As of 2018, there are around 
2.5 billion smartphone users in the world.

00:00:13.502 --> 00:00:15.981
If we broke open all their newest phones,

00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:19.019
which are just a fraction 
of the total that’ve been built,

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.110
and split them into their component parts,

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.819
that would produce 
around 85,000 kilograms of gold,

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:27.150
875,000 of silver,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.286
and 40 million kilograms of copper.

00:00:30.286 --> 00:00:33.041
How did this precious cache 
get into our phones,

00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:35.003
and can we reclaim it?

00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:38.191
Gold, silver, and copper 
are actually just a few

00:00:38.191 --> 00:00:42.509
of the 70 or so chemical elements 
that make up the average smartphone.

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:44.562
These can be divided 
into different groups,

00:00:44.562 --> 00:00:47.591
two of the most critical 
being rare earth elements

00:00:47.591 --> 00:00:49.311
and precious metals.

00:00:49.311 --> 00:00:54.530
Rare earths are a selection of 17 elements
that are actually common in Earth’s crust

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.407
and are found in many areas across 
the world in low concentrations.

00:00:58.407 --> 00:01:01.249
These elements have a huge
range of magnetic,

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:02.201
phosphorescent,

00:01:02.201 --> 00:01:03.855
and conductive properties

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:06.596
that make them crucial 
to modern technologies.

00:01:06.596 --> 00:01:09.908
In fact, of the 17 types 
of rare earth metals,

00:01:09.908 --> 00:01:13.757
phones and other electronics 
may contain up to 16.

00:01:13.757 --> 00:01:17.465
In smartphones, these create the screen 
and color display,

00:01:17.465 --> 00:01:18.915
aid conductivity,

00:01:18.915 --> 00:01:21.393
and produce the signature vibrations,

00:01:21.393 --> 00:01:22.929
amongst other things.

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:24.872
And yet, crucial as they are,

00:01:24.872 --> 00:01:26.815
extracting these elements from the earth

00:01:26.815 --> 00:01:30.660
is linked to some disturbing 
environmental impacts.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.124
Rare earth elements can often be found,

00:01:33.124 --> 00:01:34.461
but in many areas,

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:39.430
it’s not economically feasible 
to extract them due to low concentrations.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.505
Much of the time,

00:01:40.505 --> 00:01:43.950
extracting them requires 
a method called open pit mining

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.473
that exposes vast areas of land.

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:50.877
This form of mining destroys 
huge swaths of natural habitats,

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:53.008
and causes air and water pollution,

00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:56.227
threatening the health 
of nearby communities.

00:01:56.227 --> 00:01:58.685
Another group of ingredients 
in smartphones

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:01.291
comes with similar environmental risks:

00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:03.285
these are metals such as copper,

00:02:03.285 --> 00:02:04.256
silver,

00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:05.283
palladium,

00:02:05.283 --> 00:02:06.189
aluminum,

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:07.060
platinum,

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.971
tungsten,

00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:08.759
tin,

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.496
lead,

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:10.478
and gold.

00:02:10.478 --> 00:02:11.931
We also mine magnesium,

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:12.743
lithium,

00:02:12.743 --> 00:02:13.646
silica,

00:02:13.646 --> 00:02:15.391
and potassium to make phones,

00:02:15.391 --> 00:02:19.257
and all of it is associated 
with vast habitat destruction,

00:02:19.257 --> 00:02:21.603
as well as air and water pollution.

00:02:21.603 --> 00:02:24.764
Mining comes with 
worrying social problems, too,

00:02:24.764 --> 00:02:28.254
like large-scale human 
and animal displacement

00:02:28.254 --> 00:02:30.705
to make way for industrial operations,

00:02:30.705 --> 00:02:34.438
and frequently, 
poor working conditions for laborers.

00:02:34.438 --> 00:02:38.989
Lastly, phone production 
also requires petroleum,

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.513
one of the main drivers of climate change.

00:02:41.513 --> 00:02:47.223
That entwines our smartphones inextricably
with this growing planetary conundrum.

00:02:47.223 --> 00:02:48.494
And, what’s more,

00:02:48.494 --> 00:02:52.142
the ingredients we mine 
to make our phones aren’t infinite.

00:02:52.142 --> 00:02:54.367
One day, they’ll simply run out,

00:02:54.367 --> 00:02:58.336
and we haven’t yet discovered effective 
replacements for some.

00:02:58.336 --> 00:02:59.432
Despite this,

00:02:59.432 --> 00:03:02.262
the number of smartphones 
is on a steady increase;

00:03:02.262 --> 00:03:07.779
by 2019 it’s predicted that 
there’ll be close to 3 billion in use.

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:10.937
This means that reclaiming the bounty 
within our phones

00:03:10.937 --> 00:03:13.507
is swiftly becoming a necessity.

00:03:13.507 --> 00:03:15.356
So, if you have an old phone,

00:03:15.356 --> 00:03:18.765
you might want to consider your options 
before throwing it away.

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:22.332
To minimize waste, you could donate it 
to a charity for reuse,

00:03:22.332 --> 00:03:25.075
take it to an e-waste recycling facility,

00:03:25.075 --> 00:03:28.448
or look for a company 
that refurbishes old models.

00:03:28.448 --> 00:03:32.171
However, even recycling companies 
need our scrutiny.

00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:34.221
Just as the production of smartphones

00:03:34.221 --> 00:03:36.816
comes with social 
and environmental problems,

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:39.085
dismantling them does too.

00:03:39.085 --> 00:03:42.554
E-waste is sometimes intentionally 
exported to countries

00:03:42.554 --> 00:03:45.980
where labor is cheap 
but working conditions are poor.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.448
Vast workforces, 
often made up of women and children,

00:03:49.448 --> 00:03:50.809
may be underpaid,

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:53.528
lack the training 
to safely disassemble phones,

00:03:53.528 --> 00:03:56.556
and be exposed to elements 
like lead and mercury,

00:03:56.556 --> 00:03:59.692
which can permanently damage 
their nervous systems.

00:03:59.692 --> 00:04:02.373
Phone waste can also end up 
in huge dump sites,

00:04:02.373 --> 00:04:05.562
leaching toxic chemicals 
into the soil and water,

00:04:05.562 --> 00:04:09.632
mirroring the problems of the mines 
where the elements originated.

00:04:09.632 --> 00:04:13.568
A phone is much more than it appears 
to be on the surface.

00:04:13.568 --> 00:04:17.032
It’s an assemblage of elements
from multiple countries,

00:04:17.032 --> 00:04:21.085
linked to impacts 
that are unfolding on a global scale.

00:04:21.085 --> 00:04:25.040
So, until someone invents 
a completely sustainable smartphone,

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.528
we’ll need to come to terms

00:04:26.528 --> 00:04:30.543
with how this technology
affects widespread places and people.
