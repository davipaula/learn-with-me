Chris Anderson: Dr. Jane Goodall, welcome.

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:18.143
Jane Goodall: Thank you,

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:22.101
and I think, you know,
we couldn't have a complete interview

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:24.268
unless people know Mr. H is with me,

00:00:24.292 --> 00:00:26.417
because everybody knows Mr. H.

00:00:28.083 --> 00:00:29.625
CA: Hello, Mr. H.

00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:32.934
In your TED Talk 17 years ago,

00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:38.684
you warned us about the dangers
of humans crowding out the natural world.

00:00:38.708 --> 00:00:40.559
Is there any sense in which you feel

00:00:40.583 --> 00:00:44.476
that the current pandemic
is kind of, nature striking back?

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.559
JG: It's very, very clear
that these zoonotic diseases,

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:54.518
like the corona and HIV/AIDS

00:00:54.542 --> 00:00:58.893
and all sorts of other diseases
that we catch from animals,

00:00:58.917 --> 00:01:02.059
that's partly to do
with destruction of the environment,

00:01:02.083 --> 00:01:06.059
which, as animals lose habitat,
they get crowded together

00:01:06.083 --> 00:01:10.351
and sometimes that means
that a virus from a reservoir species,

00:01:10.375 --> 00:01:13.434
where it's lived harmoniously
for maybe hundreds of years,

00:01:13.458 --> 00:01:15.476
jumps into a new species,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.643
then you also get animals being pushed
into closer contact with humans.

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:26.643
And sometimes one of these animals
that has caught a virus can --

00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:30.893
you know, provides the opportunity
for that virus to jump into people

00:01:30.917 --> 00:01:34.976
and create a new disease, like COVID-19.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.018
And in addition to that,

00:01:37.042 --> 00:01:39.851
we are so disrespecting animals.

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:41.518
We hunt them,

00:01:41.542 --> 00:01:43.851
we kill them, we eat them,

00:01:43.875 --> 00:01:45.393
we traffic them,

00:01:45.417 --> 00:01:51.809
we send them off
to the wild-animal markets

00:01:51.833 --> 00:01:53.101
in Asia,

00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:56.434
where they're in terrible,
cramped conditions, in tiny cages,

00:01:56.458 --> 00:02:00.768
with people being contaminated
with blood and urine and feces,

00:02:00.792 --> 00:02:05.434
ideal conditions for a virus
to spill from an animal to an animal,

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:07.184
or an animal to a person.

00:02:07.208 --> 00:02:11.476
CA: I'd love to just dip
backwards in time for a bit,

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.393
because your story is so extraordinary.

00:02:13.417 --> 00:02:17.518
I mean, despite the arguably
even more sexist attitudes of the 1960s,

00:02:17.542 --> 00:02:20.268
somehow you were able to break through

00:02:20.292 --> 00:02:23.643
and become one of the world's
leading scientists,

00:02:23.667 --> 00:02:27.184
discovering this astonishing
series of facts about chimpanzees,

00:02:27.208 --> 00:02:30.268
such as their tool use and so much more.

00:02:30.292 --> 00:02:32.893
What was it about you, do you think,

00:02:32.917 --> 00:02:35.976
that allowed you to make
such a breakthrough?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.226
JG: Well, the thing is,
I was born loving animals,

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.393
and the most important thing was,
I had a very supportive mother.

00:02:42.417 --> 00:02:45.059
She didn't get mad when she found
earthworms in my bed,

00:02:45.083 --> 00:02:47.559
she just said they better be
in the garden.

00:02:47.583 --> 00:02:50.309
And she didn't get mad
when I disappeared for four hours

00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:53.268
and she called the police,
and I was sitting in a hen house,

00:02:53.292 --> 00:02:56.768
because nobody would tell me
where the hole was where the egg came out.

00:02:56.792 --> 00:02:59.059
I had no dream of being a scientist,

00:02:59.083 --> 00:03:01.476
because women didn't do
that sort of thing.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.726
In fact, there weren't any man
doing it back then, either.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.684
And everybody laughed at me except Mom,

00:03:06.708 --> 00:03:10.393
who said, "If you really want this,
you're going to have to work awfully hard,

00:03:10.417 --> 00:03:12.143
take advantage of every opportunity,

00:03:12.167 --> 00:03:14.393
if you don't give up,
maybe you'll find a way."

00:03:14.417 --> 00:03:18.518
CA: And somehow, you were able to kind of,
earn the trust of chimpanzees

00:03:18.542 --> 00:03:22.292
in the way that no one else had.

00:03:23.167 --> 00:03:27.809
Looking back, what were the most
exciting moments that you discovered

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:31.417
or what is it that people
still don't get about chimpanzees?

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:36.309
JG: Well, the thing is,
you say, "See things nobody else had,

00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:37.601
get their trust."

00:03:37.625 --> 00:03:39.226
Nobody else had tried.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.018
Quite honestly.

00:03:41.042 --> 00:03:46.018
So, basically, I used the same techniques

00:03:46.042 --> 00:03:50.601
that I had to study the animals
around my home when I was a child.

00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:52.184
Just sitting, patiently,

00:03:52.208 --> 00:03:54.643
not trying to get too close too quickly,

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:59.226
but it was awful, because the money
was only for six months.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.601
I mean, you can imagine
how difficult to get money

00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:03.643
for a young girl with no degree,

00:04:03.667 --> 00:04:07.434
to go and do something as bizarre
as sitting in a forest.

00:04:07.458 --> 00:04:08.934
And you know, finally,

00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:12.976
we got money for six months
from an American philanthropist,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.934
and I knew with time
I'd get the chimps' trust,

00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.476
but did I have time?

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.018
And weeks became months
and then finally, after about four months,

00:04:23.042 --> 00:04:25.809
one chimpanzee began to lose his fear,

00:04:25.833 --> 00:04:28.934
and it was he that
on one occasion I saw --

00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:32.143
I still wasn't really close,
but I had my binoculars --

00:04:32.167 --> 00:04:37.309
and I saw him using and making tools
to fish for termites.

00:04:37.333 --> 00:04:40.143
And although I wasn't terribly surprised,

00:04:40.167 --> 00:04:44.143
because I've read about things
captive chimps could do --

00:04:44.167 --> 00:04:46.184
but I knew that science believed

00:04:46.208 --> 00:04:49.559
that humans, and only humans,
used and made tools.

00:04:49.583 --> 00:04:52.809
And I knew how excited 
[Dr. Louis] Leakey would be.

00:04:52.833 --> 00:04:54.559
And it was that observation

00:04:54.583 --> 00:04:57.643
that enabled him to go
to the National Geographic,

00:04:57.667 --> 00:05:01.726
and they said, "OK, we'll continue
to support the research,"

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.893
and they sent Hugo van Lawick,
the photographer-filmmaker,

00:05:05.917 --> 00:05:08.559
to record what I was seeing.

00:05:08.583 --> 00:05:13.018
So a lot of scientists
didn't want to believe the tool-using.

00:05:13.042 --> 00:05:16.101
In fact, one of them said
I must have taught the chimps.

00:05:16.125 --> 00:05:18.018
(Laughter)

00:05:18.042 --> 00:05:20.934
Since I couldn't get near them,
it would have been a miracle.

00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.559
But anyway, once they saw Hugo's film

00:05:23.583 --> 00:05:28.018
and that with all my descriptions
of their behavior,

00:05:28.042 --> 00:05:31.351
the scientists had to start
changing their minds.

00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:34.018
CA: And since then,
numerous other discoveries

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:38.601
that placed chimpanzees much closer
to humans than people cared to believe.

00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:41.976
I think I saw you say at one point
that they have a sense of humor.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.684
How have you seen that expressed?

00:05:44.708 --> 00:05:48.934
JG: Well, you see it
when they're playing games,

00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.393
and there's a bigger one
playing with a little one,

00:05:51.417 --> 00:05:53.809
and he's trailing a vine around a tree.

00:05:53.833 --> 00:05:56.684
And every time the little one
is about to catch it,

00:05:56.708 --> 00:05:58.684
the bigger one pulls it away,

00:05:58.708 --> 00:06:00.476
and the little one starts crying

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.268
and the big one starts laughing.

00:06:02.292 --> 00:06:03.750
So, you know.

00:06:06.417 --> 00:06:11.809
CA: And then, Jane, you observed
something much more troubling,

00:06:11.833 --> 00:06:16.559
which was these instances
of chimpanzee gangs,

00:06:16.583 --> 00:06:22.684
tribes, groups, being brutally
violent to each other.

00:06:22.708 --> 00:06:26.351
I'm curious how you process that.

00:06:26.375 --> 00:06:29.601
And whether it made you, kind of,

00:06:29.625 --> 00:06:32.149
I don't know, depressed about us,
we're close to them,

00:06:32.173 --> 00:06:35.976
did it make you feel
that violence is irredeemably

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.375
part of all the great apes, somehow?

00:06:40.375 --> 00:06:42.976
JG: Well, it obviously is.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.643
And my first encounter
with human, what I call evil,

00:06:47.667 --> 00:06:49.309
was the end of the war

00:06:49.333 --> 00:06:52.101
and the pictures from the Holocaust.

00:06:52.125 --> 00:06:54.726
And you know, that really shocked me.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.018
That changed who I was.

00:06:56.042 --> 00:06:58.351
I was 10, I think, at the time.

00:06:58.375 --> 00:07:00.851
And when the chimpanzees,

00:07:00.875 --> 00:07:04.018
when I realized they have this
dark, brutal side,

00:07:04.042 --> 00:07:06.559
I thought they were like us but nicer.

00:07:06.583 --> 00:07:09.143
And then I realized
they're even more like us

00:07:09.167 --> 00:07:10.684
than I had thought.

00:07:10.708 --> 00:07:14.684
And at that time, in the early '70s,

00:07:14.708 --> 00:07:15.976
it was very strange,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.601
aggression, there was a big thing

00:07:17.625 --> 00:07:21.726
about, is aggression innate or learned.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.434
And it became political.

00:07:24.458 --> 00:07:27.893
And it was, I don't know,
it was a very strange time,

00:07:27.917 --> 00:07:29.559
and I was coming out, saying,

00:07:29.583 --> 00:07:32.143
"No, I think aggression is definitely

00:07:32.167 --> 00:07:36.268
part of our inherited
repertoire of behaviors."

00:07:36.292 --> 00:07:41.934
And I asked a very respected scientist
what he really thought,

00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.351
because he was coming out
on the clean slate,

00:07:44.375 --> 00:07:45.851
aggression is learned,

00:07:45.875 --> 00:07:50.018
and he said, "Jane, I'd rather not talk
about what I really think."

00:07:50.042 --> 00:07:53.917
That was a big shock
as far as science was concerned for me.

00:07:54.792 --> 00:07:59.351
CA: I was brought up to believe a world
of all things bright and beautiful.

00:07:59.375 --> 00:08:04.893
You know, numerous beautiful films
of butterflies and bees and flowers,

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:07.851
and you know, nature
as this gorgeous landscape.

00:08:07.875 --> 00:08:13.893
And many environmentalists
often seem to take the stance,

00:08:13.917 --> 00:08:18.059
"Yes, nature is pure,
nature is beautiful, humans are bad,"

00:08:18.083 --> 00:08:20.726
but then you have the kind of
observations that you see,

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.601
when you actually look
at any part of nature in more detail,

00:08:23.625 --> 00:08:25.976
you see things to be
terrified by, honestly.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.393
What do you make of nature,
how do you think of it,

00:08:28.417 --> 00:08:30.851
how should we think of it?

00:08:30.875 --> 00:08:32.851
JG: Nature is, you know,

00:08:32.875 --> 00:08:36.809
I mean, you think of the whole
spectrum of evolution,

00:08:36.833 --> 00:08:40.518
and there's something about going
to a pristine place,

00:08:40.542 --> 00:08:45.143
and Africa was very pristine
when I was young.

00:08:45.167 --> 00:08:48.101
And there were animals everywhere.

00:08:48.125 --> 00:08:52.018
And I never liked the fact
that lions killed,

00:08:52.042 --> 00:08:54.559
they have to, I mean, that's what they do,

00:08:54.583 --> 00:08:58.393
if they didn't kill animals,
they would die.

00:08:58.417 --> 00:09:02.101
And the big difference
between them and us, I think,

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:08.018
is that they do what they do
because that's what they have to do.

00:09:08.042 --> 00:09:11.393
And we can plan to do things.

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:13.184
Our plans are very different.

00:09:13.208 --> 00:09:17.226
We can plan to cut down a whole forest,

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.726
because we want to sell the timber,

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:22.101
or because we want to build
another shopping mall,

00:09:22.125 --> 00:09:23.393
something like that.

00:09:23.417 --> 00:09:28.143
So our destruction of nature
and our warfare,

00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:31.976
we're capable of evil
because we can sit comfortably

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.934
and plan the torture of somebody far away.

00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.226
That's evil.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:39.893
Chimpanzees have a sort of primitive war,

00:09:39.917 --> 00:09:41.476
and they can be very aggressive,

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.893
but it's of the moment.

00:09:42.917 --> 00:09:44.393
It's how they feel.

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:46.809
It's response to an emotion.

00:09:46.833 --> 00:09:50.476
CA: So your observation
of the sophistication of chimpanzees

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.893
doesn't go as far as what
some people would want to say

00:09:53.917 --> 00:09:55.643
is the sort of the human superpower,

00:09:55.667 --> 00:10:01.601
of being able to really simulate
the future in our minds in great detail

00:10:01.625 --> 00:10:04.393
and make long-term plans.

00:10:04.417 --> 00:10:09.768
And act to encourage each other
to achieve those long-term plans.

00:10:09.792 --> 00:10:13.226
That that feels, even to someone
who spent so much time with chimpanzees,

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:16.434
that feels like a fundamentally
different skill set

00:10:16.458 --> 00:10:18.601
that we just have to take
responsibility for

00:10:18.625 --> 00:10:21.434
and use much more wisely than we do.

00:10:21.458 --> 00:10:23.351
JG: Yes, and I personally think,

00:10:23.375 --> 00:10:25.684
I mean, there's a lot
of discussion about this,

00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:29.601
but I think it's a fact that we developed
the way of communication

00:10:29.625 --> 00:10:31.393
that you and I are using.

00:10:31.417 --> 00:10:33.518
And because we have words,

00:10:33.542 --> 00:10:36.934
I mean, animal communication
is way more sophisticated

00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.226
than we used to think.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:40.226
And chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:43.708
can learn human sign language of the Deaf.

00:10:44.792 --> 00:10:50.226
But we sort of grow up speaking
whatever language it is.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.893
So I can tell you about things
that you've never heard of.

00:10:53.917 --> 00:10:56.476
And a chimpanzee couldn't do that.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:01.726
And we can teach our children
about abstract things.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:03.559
And chimpanzees couldn't do that.

00:11:03.583 --> 00:11:07.268
So yes, chimpanzees can do
all sorts of clever things,

00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:11.893
and so can elephants and so can crows
and so can octopuses,

00:11:11.917 --> 00:11:15.518
but we design rockets
that go off to another planet

00:11:15.542 --> 00:11:18.101
and little robots taking photographs,

00:11:18.125 --> 00:11:22.893
and we've designed this extraordinary way
of you and me talking

00:11:22.917 --> 00:11:25.059
in our different parts of the world.

00:11:25.083 --> 00:11:26.726
When I was young, when I grew up,

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:29.559
there was no TV,
there were no cell phones,

00:11:29.583 --> 00:11:31.434
there was no computers.

00:11:31.458 --> 00:11:32.893
It was such a different world,

00:11:32.917 --> 00:11:36.518
I had a pencil, pen
and notebook, that was it.

00:11:36.542 --> 00:11:39.393
CA: So just going back
to this question about nature,

00:11:39.417 --> 00:11:40.989
because I think about this a lot,

00:11:41.013 --> 00:11:44.263
and I struggle with this, honestly.

00:11:45.208 --> 00:11:49.393
So much of your work,
so much of so many people who I respect,

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:56.226
is about this passion for trying
not to screw up the natural world.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:59.101
So is it possible, is it healthy,
is it essential, perhaps,

00:11:59.125 --> 00:12:03.976
to simultaneously accept
that many aspects of nature

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.934
are terrifying,

00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.851
but also, I don't know, that it's awesome,

00:12:08.875 --> 00:12:14.018
and that some of the awesomeness
comes from its potential to be terrifying

00:12:14.042 --> 00:12:18.934
and that it is also just
breathtakingly beautiful,

00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:22.684
and that we cannot be ourselves,
because we are part of nature,

00:12:22.708 --> 00:12:25.143
we cannot be whole

00:12:25.167 --> 00:12:29.434
unless we somehow embrace it
and are part of it?

00:12:29.458 --> 00:12:34.226
Help me with the language, Jane,
on how that relationship should be.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:38.351
JG: Well, I think one of the problems is,
you know, as we developed our intellect,

00:12:38.375 --> 00:12:41.018
and we became better and better

00:12:41.042 --> 00:12:44.434
at modifying the environment
for our own use,

00:12:44.458 --> 00:12:47.268
and creating fields and growing crops

00:12:47.292 --> 00:12:50.476
where it used to be forest or woodland,

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.309
and you know, we won't go into that now,

00:12:53.333 --> 00:12:56.893
but we have this ability to change nature.

00:12:56.917 --> 00:13:01.351
And as we've moved more
into towns and cities,

00:13:01.375 --> 00:13:05.351
and relied more on technology,

00:13:05.375 --> 00:13:08.976
many people feel so divorced
from the natural world.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.559
And there's hundreds,
thousands of children

00:13:11.583 --> 00:13:13.309
growing up in inner cities,

00:13:13.333 --> 00:13:16.059
where there basically isn't any nature,

00:13:16.083 --> 00:13:21.143
which is why this movement now
to green our cities is so important.

00:13:21.167 --> 00:13:23.518
And you know, they've done experiments,

00:13:23.542 --> 00:13:26.809
I think it was in Chicago,
I'm not quite sure,

00:13:26.833 --> 00:13:29.893
and there were various empty lots

00:13:29.917 --> 00:13:33.684
in a very violent part of town.

00:13:33.708 --> 00:13:36.768
So in some of those areas
they made it green,

00:13:36.792 --> 00:13:41.809
they put trees and flowers and things,
shrubs in these vacant lots.

00:13:41.833 --> 00:13:45.184
And the crime rate went right down.

00:13:45.208 --> 00:13:47.708
So then of course,
they put trees in the other half.

00:13:48.917 --> 00:13:50.851
So it just shows, and also,

00:13:50.875 --> 00:13:53.643
there have been studies done
showing that children

00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:57.917
really need green nature
for good psychological development.

00:13:58.875 --> 00:14:02.101
But we are, as you say, part of nature

00:14:02.125 --> 00:14:06.351
and we disrespect it, as we are,

00:14:06.375 --> 00:14:09.309
and that is so terrible for our children

00:14:09.333 --> 00:14:10.809
and our children's children,

00:14:10.833 --> 00:14:14.851
because we rely on nature
for clean air, clean water,

00:14:14.875 --> 00:14:18.434
for regulating climate and rainfall.

00:14:18.458 --> 00:14:21.226
Look what we've done,
look at the climate crisis.

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:23.476
That's us. We did that.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.184
CA: So a little over 30 years ago,

00:14:25.208 --> 00:14:31.018
you made this shift from scientist mainly
to activist mainly, I guess.

00:14:31.042 --> 00:14:32.292
Why?

00:14:33.333 --> 00:14:38.809
JG: Conference in 1986,
scientific one, I'd got my PhD by then

00:14:38.833 --> 00:14:42.559
and it was to find out
how chimp behavior differed, if it did,

00:14:42.583 --> 00:14:44.143
from one environment to another.

00:14:44.167 --> 00:14:46.559
There were six study sites across Africa.

00:14:46.583 --> 00:14:50.268
So we thought, let’s bring
these scientists together

00:14:50.292 --> 00:14:51.684
and explore this,

00:14:51.708 --> 00:14:53.226
which was fascinating.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.893
But we also had a session on conservation

00:14:55.917 --> 00:14:59.768
and a session on conditions
in some captive situations

00:14:59.792 --> 00:15:01.893
like medical research.

00:15:01.917 --> 00:15:06.184
And those two sessions
were so shocking to me.

00:15:06.208 --> 00:15:08.768
I went to the conference a a scientist,

00:15:08.792 --> 00:15:10.351
and I left as an activist.

00:15:10.375 --> 00:15:14.184
I didn't make the decision,
something happened inside me.

00:15:14.208 --> 00:15:17.726
CA: So you spent the last 34 years

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.434
sort of tirelessly campaigning
for a better relationship

00:15:20.458 --> 00:15:23.750
between people and nature.

00:15:24.667 --> 00:15:29.750
What should that relationship look like?

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.809
JG: Well, you know, again you come up
with all these problems.

00:15:35.833 --> 00:15:38.583
People have to have space to live.

00:15:39.625 --> 00:15:41.726
But I think the problem is

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:45.309
that we've become,
in the affluent societies,

00:15:45.333 --> 00:15:46.726
too greedy.

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:52.018
I mean, honestly, who needs
four houses with huge grounds?

00:15:52.042 --> 00:15:55.684
And why do we need
yet another shopping mall?

00:15:55.708 --> 00:15:57.434
And so on and so on.

00:15:57.458 --> 00:16:02.434
So we are looking
at short-term economic benefit,

00:16:02.458 --> 00:16:05.518
money has become a sort of god to worship,

00:16:05.542 --> 00:16:09.601
as we lose all spiritual connection
with the natural world.

00:16:09.625 --> 00:16:15.351
And so we're looking for short-term
monetary gain, or power,

00:16:15.375 --> 00:16:18.018
rather than the health of the planet

00:16:18.042 --> 00:16:20.083
and the future of our children.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.101
We don't seem to care about that anymore.

00:16:24.125 --> 00:16:27.226
That's why I'll never stop fighting.

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:31.059
CA: I mean, in your work
specifically on chimpanzee conservation,

00:16:31.083 --> 00:16:36.268
you've made it practice
to put people at the center of that,

00:16:36.292 --> 00:16:38.393
local people, to engage them.

00:16:38.417 --> 00:16:39.684
How has that worked

00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:41.851
and do you think that's an essential idea

00:16:41.875 --> 00:16:44.934
if we're to succeed
in protecting the planet?

00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:47.434
JG: You know, after that
famous conference,

00:16:47.458 --> 00:16:51.018
I thought, well, I must learn more
about why chimps are vanishing in Africa

00:16:51.042 --> 00:16:52.893
and what's happening to the forest.

00:16:52.917 --> 00:16:57.976
So I got a bit of money together
and went out to visit six range countries.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.018
And learned a lot about the problems
faced by chimps, you know,

00:17:02.042 --> 00:17:04.809
hunting for bushmeat
and the live animal trade

00:17:04.833 --> 00:17:06.518
and caught in snares

00:17:06.542 --> 00:17:10.934
and human populations growing
and needing more land

00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:14.684
for their crops and their cattle
and their villages.

00:17:14.708 --> 00:17:19.434
But I was also learning about the plight
faced by so many people.

00:17:19.458 --> 00:17:23.018
The absolute poverty,
the lack of health and education,

00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:25.518
the degradation of the land.

00:17:25.542 --> 00:17:30.518
And it came to a head when I flew over
the tiny Gombe National Park.

00:17:30.542 --> 00:17:34.809
It had been part of this equatorial
forest belt right across Africa

00:17:34.833 --> 00:17:36.101
to the west coast,

00:17:36.125 --> 00:17:37.434
and in 1990,

00:17:37.458 --> 00:17:41.101
it was just this little island of forest,
just tiny national park.

00:17:41.125 --> 00:17:43.018
All around, the hills were bare.

00:17:43.042 --> 00:17:44.768
And that's when it hit me.

00:17:44.792 --> 00:17:46.601
If we don't do something

00:17:46.625 --> 00:17:48.893
to help the people find ways of living

00:17:48.917 --> 00:17:51.518
without destroying their environment,

00:17:51.542 --> 00:17:54.226
we can't even try to save the chimps.

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:57.976
So the Jane Goodall Institute
began this program "Take Care,"

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.018
we call it "TACARE."

00:18:00.042 --> 00:18:03.976
And it's our method
of community-based conservation,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.101
totally holistic.

00:18:06.125 --> 00:18:09.351
And we've now put the tools
of conservation

00:18:09.375 --> 00:18:11.226
into the hand of the villagers,

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:16.351
because most Tanzanian wild chimps
are not in protected areas,

00:18:16.375 --> 00:18:19.143
they're just in the village
forest reserves.

00:18:19.167 --> 00:18:24.434
And so, they now go and measure
the health of their forest.

00:18:24.458 --> 00:18:26.684
They've understood now

00:18:26.708 --> 00:18:30.268
that protecting the forest
isn't just for wildlife,

00:18:30.292 --> 00:18:31.768
it's their own future.

00:18:31.792 --> 00:18:34.226
That they need the forest.

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:35.601
And they're very proud.

00:18:35.625 --> 00:18:37.726
The volunteers go to workshops,

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.809
they learn how to use smartphones,

00:18:39.833 --> 00:18:44.601
they learn how to upload
into platform and the cloud.

00:18:44.625 --> 00:18:47.476
And so it's all transparent.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.643
And the trees have come back,

00:18:49.667 --> 00:18:51.726
there's no bare hills anymore.

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:56.476
They agreed to make
a buffer zone around Gombe,

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.893
so the chimps have more forest
than they did in 1990.

00:18:59.917 --> 00:19:01.851
They're opening up corridors of forest

00:19:01.875 --> 00:19:07.268
to link the scattered chimp groups
so that you don't get too much inbreeding.

00:19:07.292 --> 00:19:10.434
So yes, it's worked,
and it's in six other countries now.

00:19:10.458 --> 00:19:11.726
Same thing.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:17.351
CA: I mean, you've been this extraordinary
tireless voice, all around the world,

00:19:17.375 --> 00:19:19.309
just traveling so much,

00:19:19.333 --> 00:19:22.601
speaking everywhere,
inspiring people everywhere.

00:19:22.625 --> 00:19:27.601
How on earth do you find the energy,

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:29.268
you know, the fire to do that,

00:19:29.292 --> 00:19:32.476
because that is exhausting to do,

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.018
every meeting with lots of people,

00:19:35.042 --> 00:19:37.101
it is just physically exhausting,

00:19:37.125 --> 00:19:40.143
and yet, here you are, still doing it.

00:19:40.167 --> 00:19:42.125
How are you doing this, Jane?

00:19:43.042 --> 00:19:48.393
JG: Well, I suppose, you know,
I'm obstinate, I don't like giving up,

00:19:48.417 --> 00:19:53.684
but I'm not going to let
these CEOs of big companies

00:19:53.708 --> 00:19:55.226
who are destroying the forests,

00:19:55.250 --> 00:20:01.809
or the politicians who are unraveling
all the protections that were put in place

00:20:01.833 --> 00:20:03.143
by previous presidents,

00:20:03.167 --> 00:20:05.976
and you know who I'm talking about.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.143
And you know, I'll go on fighting,

00:20:08.167 --> 00:20:12.268
I care about, I'm passionate
about the wildlife.

00:20:12.292 --> 00:20:14.976
I'm passionate about the natural world.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.434
I love forests, it hurts me
to see them damaged.

00:20:19.458 --> 00:20:22.351
And I care passionately about children.

00:20:22.375 --> 00:20:24.434
And we're stealing their future.

00:20:24.458 --> 00:20:26.184
And I'm not going to give up.

00:20:26.208 --> 00:20:31.143
So I guess I'm blessed
with good genes, that's a gift,

00:20:31.167 --> 00:20:34.768
and the other gift,
which I discovered I had,

00:20:34.792 --> 00:20:36.226
was communication,

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:38.893
whether it's writing or speaking.

00:20:38.917 --> 00:20:40.976
And so, you know,

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.893
if going around like this wasn't working,

00:20:43.917 --> 00:20:47.018
but every time I do a lecture,

00:20:47.042 --> 00:20:48.393
people come up and say,

00:20:48.417 --> 00:20:50.768
"Well, I had given up,
but you've inspired me,

00:20:50.792 --> 00:20:53.059
I promise to do my bit."

00:20:53.083 --> 00:20:57.976
And we have our youth program
"Roots and Shoots" now in 65 countries

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.559
and growing fast,

00:20:59.583 --> 00:21:00.851
all ages,

00:21:00.875 --> 00:21:04.018
all choosing projects to help
people, animals, the environment,

00:21:04.042 --> 00:21:06.643
rolling up their sleeves
and taking action.

00:21:06.667 --> 00:21:09.809
And you know, they look at you
with shining eyes,

00:21:09.833 --> 00:21:12.309
wanting to tell Dr. Jane
what they've been doing

00:21:12.333 --> 00:21:14.101
to make the world a better place.

00:21:14.125 --> 00:21:15.934
How can I let them down?

00:21:15.958 --> 00:21:19.226
CA: I mean, as you look
at the planet's future,

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:20.893
what worries you most, actually,

00:21:20.917 --> 00:21:24.292
what scares you most about where we're at?

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:31.101
JG: Well, the fact that we have
a small window of time, I believe,

00:21:31.125 --> 00:21:34.643
when we can at least start
healing some of the harm

00:21:34.667 --> 00:21:37.726
and slowing down climate change.

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:39.726
But it is closing,

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:44.934
and we've seen what happens
with the lockdown around the world

00:21:44.958 --> 00:21:47.018
because of COVID-19:

00:21:47.042 --> 00:21:49.226
clear skies over cities,

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:53.101
some people breathing clean air
that they've never breathed before

00:21:53.125 --> 00:21:56.059
and looking up
at the shining skies at night,

00:21:56.083 --> 00:21:58.684
which they've never seen properly before.

00:21:58.708 --> 00:22:01.059
And you know,

00:22:01.083 --> 00:22:04.143
so what worries me most

00:22:04.167 --> 00:22:07.476
is how to get enough people,

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.786
people understand,
but they're not taking action,

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:12.434
how to get enough people to take action?

00:22:12.458 --> 00:22:18.184
CA: National Geographic just launched
this extraordinary film about you,

00:22:18.208 --> 00:22:21.768
highlighting your work over six decades.

00:22:21.792 --> 00:22:25.208
It's titled "Jane Goodall: The Hope."

00:22:26.042 --> 00:22:28.018
So what is the hope, Jane?

00:22:28.042 --> 00:22:29.309
JG: Well, the hope,

00:22:29.333 --> 00:22:31.393
my greatest hope
is all these young people.

00:22:31.417 --> 00:22:33.976
I mean, in China,
people will come up and say,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.143
"Well, of course I care
about the environment,

00:22:36.167 --> 00:22:38.434
I was in 'Roots and Shoots'
in primary school."

00:22:38.458 --> 00:22:41.768
And you know, we have "Roots and Shoots"
just hanging on to the values

00:22:41.792 --> 00:22:46.601
and they're so enthusiastic
once they know the problems

00:22:46.625 --> 00:22:48.476
and they're empowered to take action,

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:52.667
they are clearing the streams,
removing invasive species humanely.

00:22:53.958 --> 00:22:55.684
And they have so many ideas.

00:22:55.708 --> 00:23:00.393
And then there's, you know,
this extraordinary intellect of ours.

00:23:00.417 --> 00:23:04.476
We're beginning to use it
to come up with technology

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.351
that really will help us
to live in greater harmony,

00:23:07.375 --> 00:23:08.976
and in our individual lives,

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.101
let's think about the consequences
of what we do each day.

00:23:13.125 --> 00:23:15.226
What do we buy, where did it come from,

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:16.809
how was it made?

00:23:16.833 --> 00:23:19.768
Did it harm the environment,
was it cruel to animals?

00:23:19.792 --> 00:23:22.143
Is it cheap because of child slave labor?

00:23:22.167 --> 00:23:24.018
Make ethical choices.

00:23:24.042 --> 00:23:27.559
Which you can't do if you're living
in poverty, by the way.

00:23:27.583 --> 00:23:30.268
And then finally, this indomitable spirit

00:23:30.292 --> 00:23:32.893
of people who tackle what seems impossible

00:23:32.917 --> 00:23:35.351
and won't give up.

00:23:35.375 --> 00:23:38.476
You can't give up when you have those ...

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:41.018
But you know, there are things
that I can't fight.

00:23:41.042 --> 00:23:43.625
I can't fight corruption.

00:23:44.833 --> 00:23:48.958
I can't fight military
regimes and dictators.

00:23:50.625 --> 00:23:52.476
So I can only do what I can do,

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.893
and if we all do the bits that we can do,

00:23:55.917 --> 00:23:59.809
surely that makes a whole
that eventually will win out.

00:23:59.833 --> 00:24:01.226
CA: So, last question, Jane.

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:03.559
If there was one idea, one thought,

00:24:03.583 --> 00:24:08.309
one seed you could plant
in the minds of everyone watching this,

00:24:08.333 --> 00:24:10.184
what would that be?

00:24:10.208 --> 00:24:14.351
JG: You know, just remember
that every day you live,

00:24:14.375 --> 00:24:16.726
you make an impact on the planet.

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.018
You can't help making an impact.

00:24:19.042 --> 00:24:22.601
And at least, unless
you're living in extreme poverty,

00:24:22.625 --> 00:24:25.851
you have a choice as to what sort
of impact you make.

00:24:25.875 --> 00:24:27.809
Even in poverty you have a choice,

00:24:27.833 --> 00:24:31.726
but when we are more affluent,
we have a greater choice.

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:34.643
And if we all make ethical choices,

00:24:34.667 --> 00:24:37.809
then we start moving towards a world

00:24:37.833 --> 00:24:42.893
that will be not quite so desperate
to leave to our great-grandchildren.

00:24:42.917 --> 00:24:47.684
That's, I think, something for everybody.

00:24:47.708 --> 00:24:50.684
Because a lot of people
understand what's happening,

00:24:50.708 --> 00:24:53.476
but they feel helpless and hopeless,
and what can they do,

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.059
so they do nothing
and they become apathetic.

00:24:56.083 --> 00:24:58.875
And that is a huge danger, apathy.

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:01.934
CA: Dr. Jane Goodall, wow.

00:25:01.958 --> 00:25:05.934
I really want to thank you
for your extraordinary life,

00:25:05.958 --> 00:25:07.976
for all that you've done

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.858
and for spending this time with us now.

00:25:09.882 --> 00:25:11.268
Thank you.

00:25:11.292 --> 00:25:12.542
JG: Thank you.
