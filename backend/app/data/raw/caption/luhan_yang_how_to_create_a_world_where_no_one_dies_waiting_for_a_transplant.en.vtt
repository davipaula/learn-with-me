00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.056
Hi everyone.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.560
I would like to introduce you to Laika.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.880
To most of us, Laika is simply
a very cute pig.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.336
However, to hundreds of thousands
of patients in need of a lifesaving organ

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.640
Laika is a symbol of hope.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.056
You see, ever since the 1970s,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.376
when organ transplants
became a real option

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.616
for patients with kidney failure
and other organ diseases,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.240
organ supply has been an issue.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.816
Over the last few decades,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.880
the issue only worsened as organ demand
has exponentially increased.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.696
Currently in the US,

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.896
there are close to 115,000 patients

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.680
in need of a lifesaving organ transplant.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.336
By the end of my talk,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.120
one more patient
will be added to this list.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.495
Today, about 100 people
will get a new organ,

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:19.336
a chance to start their life anew,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.336
and yet by the end of today,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.840
20 others will die waiting.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.736
The situation is heartbreaking

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.656
for patients, for their families

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.680
and for the doctors who want to do more.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.936
In some parts of the world,

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.560
the situation also becomes
a disturbing social issue.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.096
In Asia, for example,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.176
media outlets reported
that desperate patients

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.120
are obtaining organs
from the cruel black market.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.016
It is clear that a solution
is needed to this crisis.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.600
Human lives are at stake.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.216
As a biologist and a geneticist,

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.920
it has become my mission
to help solve this problem.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.776
Today, I am optimistic to say
that we are on our way there,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.000
thanks to Laika.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.936
Using gene editing technology,

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.816
it's now possible to exquisitely create
a human-transplantable organ

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.400
that can be safely grown in pigs.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.176
Before we jump into the incredible
science that makes it happen,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.600
let's have a better understanding
what xenotransplantation is.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.600
It's a process of transplanting
animal organs into humans.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.496
You may want to ask, why pig organs?

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.336
Because some pigs carry organs
with similar size and physiology

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.560
to human organs.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.696
Over the last half a century,

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.576
pioneers of transplantation
have tried hard to make it happen,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.480
but with limited to no success.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.280
Why is that?

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.640
Two fundamental hurdles stood in the way.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.416
First is a problem of rejection.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.256
When our immune system
sees a new organ as foreign,

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.520
it will reject it.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.720
Second, and this one is specific
to the organs from the pig,

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.176
every pig carries a virus
that is benign to the pig,

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.856
but can be transmitted into humans.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.376
It is called the porcine
endogenous retrovirus (PERV),

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.400
and this virus has the potential
to cause a viral epidemic similar to HIV.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.056
Without an effective way
to address these issues,

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.680
the field of xenotransplantation
has been on hold for more than one decade.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.680
Little progress has been made, until now.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.160
Let me share with you
how I got here today with Laika.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.296
My journey started
from Emei Mountain in China.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.736
That is the place well described
in a lot of legendary stories,

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.400
like the "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.160
That is the place I call home.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.656
Growing up in the mountain,

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.760
I started to have
a strong connection with nature.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.736
This is me when I was seven years old

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.176
standing in front
of an ancient Buddhist temple

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.216
with a monkey on my shoulder.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.816
I still vividly remember
how my friends and I

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.016
would toss peanuts around
to distract the monkeys

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.720
so that we could cross
to hike through the valley.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.336
I love nature.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.216
When it was time
to choose a field of study,

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.240
I chose to study biology
at Peking University in Beijing.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.256
However, the more I learned,

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.600
the more questions I had.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.056
How could our genetic makeup
be so similar to animals

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.000
and yet we look so different?

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.776
How is our immune system capable
of fighting off so many pathogens

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.520
but smart enough not to attack ourselves.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.800
Questions like this tormented me.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.720
I know it sounds nerdy,
but you know I'm a scientist.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.256
After college, I decided
I didn't want to just ask the questions,

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.440
I wanted to answer them, so I did.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.616
In 2008, I was lucky enough to be accepted

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.176
into the PhD program at Harvard University

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.280
and worked with Dr. George Church.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.656
While working in Church's lab,

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.360
I started to learn and experiment
with the genetic makeup of mammals.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.456
Among all the experiments,

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.680
one particular one
took me closer to Laika.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:03.456
In 2013, my colleagues and I
made changes in a human cell

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.936
using a tool you may have heard about

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.496
called CRISPR.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.736
We were one of the first two groups

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:16.136
to report the successful use
of such a tool in changing our DNA.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.680
It was an exciting moment
in scientific discovery.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.136
The gene-editing tool CRISPR
has two components.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.656
It has a scissor called the enzyme CRISPR

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.360
and what is called a guide RNA.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.056
Think about it as genetic scissors
with a microscope.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.176
The microscope is a guide RNA,

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.216
which brings the scissors
to the place we want to cut

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.256
and says, "Here it is,"

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:50.520
and the enzyme CRISPR just cuts
and repairs the DNA in the way we want.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.936
Shortly after we reported our study,

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:00.896
physicians at Mass General Hospital
were intrigued by the medical applications

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.496
of our research.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.016
They reached out to us,

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.136
and together, we began to see
the potential to use CRISPR

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.760
to solve the organ shortage crisis.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.456
How do we do it?

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.600
It is simple, yet very complex.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:24.096
We started by making changes
in a pig's cell to make it virus-free

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.896
and human-immune-compatible.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.696
The nucleus of that cell
is then implanted into a pig egg

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.616
and allowed to divide into an embryo.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:39.936
The resulting embryo is then placed
into the uterus of a surrogate mother

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.000
and allowed to divide into a pig.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.040
Basically, it's a process of cloning.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.616
The piglet then carries organs
whose genetic makeup

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.240
hopefully wouldn't be rejected
by the human immune system.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:01.376
In 2015, our team decided to tackle
the viral transmission problem first.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:07.576
We wanted to take out
all 62 copies of the PERV virus

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.000
from the pig genome,

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.336
but at the time,
it was nearly mission impossible.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.776
Even with CRISPR,

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.616
we could only do one or two
modifications within a cell.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:27.176
The record for number of modifications
we can do in a particular cell was five.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:32.440
We had to increase the throughput
by more than tenfold to achieve that.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:37.056
With very careful design
and hundreds of trials,

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.296
we successfully took out all the virus,

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.896
broke the record.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.376
More importantly, our studies showed

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:49.456
that we could eliminate
the possibility of this dangerous virus

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.799
being transmitted into humans.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.456
Last year, with a modified cell
and cloning technology,

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.320
our startup, eGenesis, produced Laika,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.640
the first pig of its kind
born without PERV.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.216
(Applause)

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.216
Laika represents the first critical step

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.976
in establishing safe xenotransplantation.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.896
It is also a platform

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.896
that we can do further
genetic modification on

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.120
to solve the immunology problem.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:31.856
Since then, we have created
more than 30 pigs without PERV,

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:37.480
and they may be the most advanced
geno-modified animal living on earth.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.696
We named Laika after the Soviet dog

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.040
who was the first animal
to orbit the earth.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.576
We hope Laika and her siblings

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:53.400
can lead us into a new frontier
of science and medicine.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:00.496
Imagine a world where patients
who suffer from liver failure

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.176
can be saved with a new liver

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.256
without having to wait for a donation

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.080
or another human to die.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.696
Imagine a world where people with diabetes

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.456
do not have to rely
on insulin after every meal

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.576
because we can provide them
with good pancreatic cells

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.880
that can produce insulin on their own.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:29.576
And imagine a world
where patients with kidney failure

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.280
do not have to face
the burden of dialysis.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.056
We are striving to create that world,

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.880
a world without organ shortage.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.456
We finally have the tool
to tackle the problem

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.616
we could never tackle before,

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.920
and Laika is just
the beginning of our journey.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.576
We have to be very humble
in front of nature,

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.216
because there are more issues
to be addressed,

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.856
including immunology

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.840
and things we couldn't even
anticipate at this point.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:10.896
However, it is our responsibility
to translate the cutting-edge science

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:16.240
into medicine to save the lives
of all the patients who are waiting.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.736
Thank you very much.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:23.600
(Applause)

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.296
Chris Anderson: I mean, Luhan,
this is extraordinary work here.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.520
Come forward.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:40.056
So what's the next steps here?
You've got rid of the virus.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.416
The next steps involve
trying to get to the point

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:46.216
where a human body
won't reject a transplant.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.040
What's involved in solving that?

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.416
Luhan Yang: It's a very
complicated process.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.896
So we need to take out
the antigen of the pigs.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.336
In addition, we can learn
a lot from cancer.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.536
How can cancer invade
or circumvent our immune system

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:08.016
so that we can utilize the trick of cancer

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.376
and implement that on the pig organ

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.480
to fool our immune system
to not attack the organ.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.056
CA: When would you estimate,
when do you hope

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.400
that the first successful
transplant would happen?

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:27.240
LY: It would be irresponsible for me
to give you any number.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.320
CA: We're at TED.
We're always irresponsible.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.496
LY: But we are working day and night

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.600
trying to make this happen
for the patients.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.336
CA: So not even, you won't say
that you think it could happen

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.736
within a decade or within
five years or something?

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.160
LY: For sure we hope it happens
within one decade.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.016
(Laughter)

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.656
CA: So there's a lot of people here
who would be very, very excited at that,

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.176
the potential is extraordinary.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.616
There will be some other
people here who are going,

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.896
"That pig is too cute.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:59.496
Humans shouldn't be exploiting
something so cute for our benefit."

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.960
Do you have any response to that?

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.376
LY: Yeah, sure.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:09.296
So imagine one pig
can save eight people's lives.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.416
In addition, similar to human donation,

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.176
if we only harvest
one kidney from the pig,

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.096
the pig can still be alive,

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.176
so we are very mindful about the issues,

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.576
but I think our goal is just to address
the unmet medical need

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.296
for those patients and their families.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.600
CA: Plus, no one can say that to you
if they eat bacon, right?

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.656
LY: That's a good point.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.136
(Laughter)

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.616
CA: Luhan, thank you so much.
LY: Thank you so much.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.880
(Applause)
