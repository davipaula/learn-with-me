00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.809
Food delivery.

00:00:14.833 --> 00:00:17.809
It's the thing that saves
millennials from starvation.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.188
By my calculations,

00:00:20.212 --> 00:00:23.950
Americans order over 20 million
restaurant deliveries

00:00:23.974 --> 00:00:25.640
every single day.

00:00:26.022 --> 00:00:29.458
Over half of these deliveries
are actually within walking distance.

00:00:29.482 --> 00:00:33.233
But nine out of 10 are delivered in cars.

00:00:33.607 --> 00:00:35.933
So basically,

00:00:35.957 --> 00:00:37.861
we are moving a two-pound burrito

00:00:37.885 --> 00:00:39.655
in a two-ton car

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:41.914
20 million times a day.

00:00:41.938 --> 00:00:44.072
The energy to bring you that burrito

00:00:44.096 --> 00:00:46.850
is actually bringing you
a two-ton metal cage

00:00:46.874 --> 00:00:48.263
with heated seats.

00:00:48.287 --> 00:00:49.609
Let's be honest.

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:51.633
We are addicted to our cars.

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:53.935
Did you know that in America,

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:57.434
for every car,
there are four parking spots?

00:00:57.458 --> 00:00:58.831
In some downtowns,

00:00:58.855 --> 00:01:01.942
over half of the real estate is for cars.

00:01:02.427 --> 00:01:05.401
We have designed our cities
around our cars,

00:01:05.425 --> 00:01:08.290
because we drive
whether we're going two miles

00:01:08.314 --> 00:01:09.861
or 200 miles.

00:01:09.885 --> 00:01:12.290
Solo, or with our whole family.

00:01:12.688 --> 00:01:17.600
We get into the same SUV
to go buy coffee or a coffee table.

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:20.796
If we could free up
some of these streets and parking lots,

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.201
we could build more housing,

00:01:22.225 --> 00:01:24.328
more social spaces, more parks.

00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:26.014
But to do that,

00:01:26.038 --> 00:01:29.942
first, we need to rethink
how we are using cars today.

00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:31.395
In the city of the future,

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:35.065
if you want to go five blocks,
you summon a bike or a scooter.

00:01:35.089 --> 00:01:38.376
If you're in a rush,
a passenger drone would pick you up.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.661
And if you need food,
no need to have someone drive over --

00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:44.271
the food will make its way to you.

00:01:44.295 --> 00:01:47.959
Let's go back to those 20 million a day
restaurant deliveries.

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:51.150
If we could get
these deliveries off the road,

00:01:51.174 --> 00:01:52.609
we could reduce the need

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:57.363
for as many as one and a half
million cars just in the US.

00:01:57.387 --> 00:01:59.833
That's twice the size of San Francisco.

00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:04.091
Now, think of the impact this could have
on cities like Delhi,

00:02:04.115 --> 00:02:06.545
or my birth city of Tehran,

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.053
where car pollution is killing
thousands of people every year.

00:02:10.546 --> 00:02:15.455
So how do we get some
of these deliveries off the road?

00:02:16.661 --> 00:02:18.391
Well, that's the question

00:02:18.415 --> 00:02:21.913
that my team and I have been obsessed with
over the last three years.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.475
And the solution is
actually one of the building blocks

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:27.341
of the city of the future.

00:02:27.944 --> 00:02:32.155
We've been creating
small, self-driving robots

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:34.806
that navigate quiet alleys and sidewalks

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.512
on a walking pace

00:02:36.536 --> 00:02:40.106
and have a secured cargo
to deliver you food and supplies.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.304
Now, before I tell you
more about the robots,

00:02:43.328 --> 00:02:45.328
let's do a quick thought experiment.

00:02:45.947 --> 00:02:50.372
In your mind, picture a city
with thousands of robots.

00:02:51.007 --> 00:02:52.341
Is it this one?

00:02:52.761 --> 00:02:56.601
This Hollywood dystopia
is what a lot of people expect.

00:02:56.625 --> 00:03:02.307
But our job is to create a friendly future
that's designed for people.

00:03:02.331 --> 00:03:05.298
So instead of making aliens,

00:03:05.322 --> 00:03:09.004
we set out to create robots
that are familiar.

00:03:09.361 --> 00:03:12.100
Robots that would belong
in our communities.

00:03:12.665 --> 00:03:14.720
But we also wanted a little surprise.

00:03:14.744 --> 00:03:17.505
Something unexpectedly delightful.

00:03:17.815 --> 00:03:18.974
Think about it.

00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:20.481
You're walking down the street,

00:03:20.505 --> 00:03:22.710
and you see your very first robot.

00:03:22.734 --> 00:03:25.052
That's the moment
when you're going to decide

00:03:25.076 --> 00:03:27.861
if this is a future you love or fear.

00:03:28.861 --> 00:03:32.137
And with a lot of people
having these dystopian ideas,

00:03:32.161 --> 00:03:34.383
we need to open their minds.

00:03:34.407 --> 00:03:36.772
We want to surprise and delight them,

00:03:36.796 --> 00:03:39.952
so that we can win them over
on first impression.

00:03:39.976 --> 00:03:41.380
This is what we came up with.

00:03:41.404 --> 00:03:44.174
It's familiar, but it's also surprising.

00:03:44.555 --> 00:03:46.483
It's just a shopping cart,

00:03:46.507 --> 00:03:50.267
but it also looks like
we crossbred WALL-E with Minions.

00:03:51.004 --> 00:03:53.853
If you live in San Francisco
or Los Angeles,

00:03:53.877 --> 00:03:56.933
chances are one of these
has already delivered your food.

00:03:57.482 --> 00:04:00.244
As soon as we put robots
out on the street,

00:04:00.268 --> 00:04:02.415
we learned some
really interesting problems.

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:05.400
Like, how should robots cross the road?

00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:11.330
Or how should robots interact with people
with visual or mobility impairments?

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:15.805
We quickly realized
that we need to teach our robots

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.099
how to communicate with people.

00:04:18.877 --> 00:04:21.718
People on the sidewalk
come from every walk of life,

00:04:21.742 --> 00:04:24.960
so we needed to create a new language,

00:04:24.984 --> 00:04:26.729
kind of a universal language

00:04:26.753 --> 00:04:29.864
so people and robots
can understand each other

00:04:29.888 --> 00:04:31.253
right off the bat.

00:04:31.277 --> 00:04:34.345
Because no one is going
to be reading user manuals.

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:39.441
We started with eyes,
because eyes are universal.

00:04:39.465 --> 00:04:41.403
They can show where the robot is going

00:04:41.427 --> 00:04:43.513
or if it's confused.

00:04:43.537 --> 00:04:46.378
Plus, eyes make robots more human.

00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:49.045
We also used sounds.

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:51.534
For example, we created this running sound

00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:53.379
with frequent gaps

00:04:53.403 --> 00:04:57.268
so that people with visual impairments
could locate their robots

00:04:57.292 --> 00:04:59.244
using the Doppler effect.

00:04:59.268 --> 00:05:02.061
But it turned out these were not enough.

00:05:02.085 --> 00:05:03.299
At intersections,

00:05:03.323 --> 00:05:05.323
cars would cut in front of our robots.

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:07.863
Drivers were getting confused sometimes,

00:05:07.887 --> 00:05:11.931
because robots would take too long
before they started crossing.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.467
Even ordinary pedestrians
were getting confused.

00:05:15.796 --> 00:05:19.188
Sometimes, they couldn't figure out
on which side to pass the robots,

00:05:19.212 --> 00:05:22.640
because robots make a lot
of small adjustments to their direction

00:05:22.664 --> 00:05:23.836
as they move.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.312
This actually sparked a new idea.

00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:30.669
What if we used movement
to create a universal language?

00:05:31.106 --> 00:05:32.772
Like, at intersections,

00:05:32.796 --> 00:05:36.201
robots would gently move forward
before they start crossing,

00:05:36.225 --> 00:05:38.820
to signal to drivers that it's their turn.

00:05:39.928 --> 00:05:41.864
If they see someone in a wheelchair,

00:05:41.888 --> 00:05:45.982
they yield by pointing themselves
away from the sidewalk,

00:05:46.006 --> 00:05:48.299
to signal that they're not going to move.

00:05:49.704 --> 00:05:51.371
Some of you may remember this.

00:05:51.395 --> 00:05:56.833
In 2015, Canadian researchers
sent a robot hitchhiking across the US.

00:05:57.677 --> 00:05:59.304
It didn't get very far.

00:05:59.328 --> 00:06:03.360
It turns out that robots
can also use some social skills.

00:06:03.384 --> 00:06:05.498
Like, if they're being tampered with,

00:06:05.522 --> 00:06:10.934
Carnegie Mellon researchers have shown
that small toy robots should play dead,

00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.800
because people feel bad
when they think they broke it.

00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:16.490
But delivery robots aren't toys,

00:06:16.514 --> 00:06:19.069
they're not small,
they are out there in public.

00:06:19.394 --> 00:06:22.371
We found that with delivery robots,

00:06:22.395 --> 00:06:24.331
to get people to stop tampering,

00:06:24.355 --> 00:06:26.355
robots need to show awareness.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.410
It's kind of the opposite of playing dead.

00:06:29.792 --> 00:06:30.991
In this case,

00:06:31.015 --> 00:06:33.656
robots need to acknowledge the situation

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.680
to get people to step away.

00:06:36.546 --> 00:06:37.991
Also, a word of advice.

00:06:38.015 --> 00:06:40.910
If you are a robot and you see small kids,

00:06:40.934 --> 00:06:42.934
run towards the closest adult.

00:06:43.315 --> 00:06:47.066
It turns out that some kids
just love harassing robots.

00:06:47.455 --> 00:06:50.010
So besides dystopia,

00:06:50.034 --> 00:06:53.098
Hollywood also promised us
some really cool robots

00:06:53.122 --> 00:06:55.983
that would run our errands
or keep us company.

00:06:56.007 --> 00:06:58.880
So far, we've really focused
on food delivery,

00:06:58.904 --> 00:07:00.555
but in the future,

00:07:00.579 --> 00:07:02.537
these robots can do more.

00:07:02.561 --> 00:07:07.252
Like, they could gather excess food
and bring it to shelters every night.

00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:11.593
Because in America,
we waste 30 percent of our food,

00:07:11.617 --> 00:07:15.145
while 10 percent of our people
experience food insecurity.

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:17.169
These robots could be
part of the solution.

00:07:18.003 --> 00:07:22.018
Or when we have hundreds of robots
running around cities,

00:07:22.042 --> 00:07:26.285
we could have robots carry
emergency medications at all times,

00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:29.539
just in case someone nearby
has an allergic reaction

00:07:29.563 --> 00:07:31.071
or an asthma attack.

00:07:31.095 --> 00:07:34.291
These robots could be on-site
within a minute or two,

00:07:34.315 --> 00:07:35.838
faster than anyone else.

00:07:35.862 --> 00:07:37.498
And during pandemics,

00:07:37.522 --> 00:07:40.005
robots can be a key part
of our infrastructure.

00:07:40.458 --> 00:07:41.807
They can ensure

00:07:41.831 --> 00:07:45.418
that we can provide our communities
with the essential needs

00:07:45.442 --> 00:07:47.069
even during emergencies.

00:07:47.093 --> 00:07:49.616
Let me leave you with one last thought.

00:07:50.331 --> 00:07:55.631
Today, objects can't get from A to B
without human help,

00:07:55.655 --> 00:07:59.329
because our three-dimensional world
is quite complex.

00:07:59.814 --> 00:08:03.532
But new sensors and AI can change that.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.826
In a way, technology is like a baby

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:11.260
that has just learned to recognize objects
and understand words,

00:08:11.284 --> 00:08:14.156
and maybe even hold a basic conversation,

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.180
but it hasn't learned to walk yet.

00:08:16.934 --> 00:08:19.498
Now, we are teaching technology

00:08:19.522 --> 00:08:21.806
how to navigate
the three-dimensional world

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.292
without our help.

00:08:24.585 --> 00:08:26.664
We are entering this new era

00:08:26.688 --> 00:08:31.315
where insentient objects
are going to get up and move freely.

00:08:32.305 --> 00:08:33.791
And when they do,

00:08:33.815 --> 00:08:36.473
we've got to make sure
they don't look like aliens.

00:08:36.497 --> 00:08:41.236
My vision for the future
is that when things come to life,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.720
they do so with joy.

00:08:43.053 --> 00:08:46.095
You know, less like
the movie "Terminator"

00:08:46.119 --> 00:08:47.786
and more like "Toy Story."

00:08:48.159 --> 00:08:49.373
Thank you.
