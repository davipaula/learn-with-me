00:00:13.595 --> 00:00:17.848
Thirteen point eight billion years ago,

00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:21.675
the universe as we know it
began with a big bang,

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:27.616
and everything that we know and are
and are made of was created.

00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:31.531
Fifty thousand years ago,

00:00:31.555 --> 00:00:35.277
our brains underwent
a major genetic mutation,

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:39.796
which resulted in the biological
reorganization of the brain.

00:00:40.494 --> 00:00:45.131
Some scientists call this
"The Big Brain Bang."

00:00:45.887 --> 00:00:49.018
Others call it "The Great Leap Forward,"

00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:50.196
which I prefer.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.648
It's so much more poetic.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.607
This is when Homo sapiens began to evolve
into the modern species that we are today.

00:00:59.778 --> 00:01:04.509
The Great Leap Forward activated
most of our modern abilities:

00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:07.069
abstract thought, planning,

00:01:08.124 --> 00:01:10.487
cooking, competitive labor,

00:01:10.511 --> 00:01:13.574
language, art, music

00:01:13.598 --> 00:01:15.079
and self-decoration.

00:01:15.591 --> 00:01:17.224
After the Great Leap Forward,

00:01:17.248 --> 00:01:21.584
there was an explosion
of stone toolmaking,

00:01:21.608 --> 00:01:24.035
more sophisticated weaponry

00:01:24.059 --> 00:01:27.202
and, 32,000 years ago,

00:01:27.226 --> 00:01:33.946
the creation of our first sophisticated
mark-making on the cave walls of Lascaux.

00:01:35.183 --> 00:01:39.562
It's not a coincidence that we've gone
from documenting our reality

00:01:39.586 --> 00:01:42.033
on the cave walls of Lascaux

00:01:42.057 --> 00:01:44.843
to the walls of Facebook.

00:01:45.311 --> 00:01:48.408
And, in a very meta experience,

00:01:48.432 --> 00:01:52.998
you can now a book a trip
to see the walls of Lascaux

00:01:53.022 --> 00:01:54.924
on the walls of Facebook.

00:01:56.114 --> 00:01:58.937
Approximately 10,000 years ago,

00:01:58.962 --> 00:02:03.803
men and women began to array
themselves with makeup.

00:02:04.048 --> 00:02:05.939
They started to self-decorate.

00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:11.926
But this wasn't for seductive purposes;
this was for religious convictions.

00:02:11.951 --> 00:02:16.073
We wanted to be more
beautiful, purer, cleaner

00:02:16.098 --> 00:02:19.157
in the eyes of something or someone

00:02:19.182 --> 00:02:21.801
that we believed
had more power than we did.

00:02:22.585 --> 00:02:24.433
There is no culture

00:02:25.276 --> 00:02:27.733
in recorded human history

00:02:27.757 --> 00:02:32.656
that has not practiced
some form of organized worship,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.464
which we now call "religion."

00:02:36.308 --> 00:02:40.470
Six thousand years ago,
in an effort to unite people,

00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:47.014
our ancestors began to design
telegraphic symbols to represent beliefs

00:02:47.038 --> 00:02:49.427
and to identify affiliations.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.762
These symbols connected
like-minded people,

00:02:53.786 --> 00:02:55.816
and they are all extraordinary.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.206
These affiliations allowed us
to feel safer and more secure in groups,

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.924
and the sharing created consensus
around what the symbols represented.

00:03:06.948 --> 00:03:10.150
With these marks,
you knew where you fit in,

00:03:10.174 --> 00:03:13.360
both for the people
that were in the in crowd

00:03:13.384 --> 00:03:17.061
and those, as importantly,
that were excluded.

00:03:17.085 --> 00:03:23.313
These symbols were created in what
I consider to be a very bottom-up manner:

00:03:23.337 --> 00:03:26.408
they were made by people for people

00:03:26.432 --> 00:03:30.022
and then shared for free among people

00:03:30.046 --> 00:03:33.548
to honor the higher power
that they ascribed to.

00:03:34.232 --> 00:03:39.370
What's ironic is that the higher power
actually had nothing to do with this.

00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:42.782
These early affiliations,

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:45.846
they often shared
identical characteristics,

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.750
which is rather baffling

00:03:47.774 --> 00:03:51.263
given how scattered we were
all over the planet.

00:03:51.287 --> 00:03:55.328
We constructed similar rituals,
practices and behaviors

00:03:55.352 --> 00:04:00.459
no matter where we were
anywhere on the globe.

00:04:00.483 --> 00:04:06.125
We constructed rituals
to create symbolic logos.

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:08.614
We built environments for worship.

00:04:08.638 --> 00:04:12.831
We developed strict rules
on how to engage with each other

00:04:12.855 --> 00:04:15.085
with food, with hair,

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:17.044
with birth, with death,

00:04:17.068 --> 00:04:19.438
with marriage and procreation.

00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:23.929
Some of the symbols
have eerie commonalities.

00:04:24.315 --> 00:04:29.842
The hand of God shows up
over and over and over again.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.791
It shows up as the hamsa hand
in Mesopotamia.

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:37.234
It shows us as the hand
of Fatima in Islam.

00:04:37.258 --> 00:04:40.840
It shows up as the hand
of Miriam in Judaism.

00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:46.569
Now, when we didn't agree
on what our beliefs and behaviors were

00:04:46.593 --> 00:04:47.807
in regards to others,

00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:52.118
if we felt that somebody
else's were incorrect,

00:04:52.142 --> 00:04:54.150
we began to fight,

00:04:54.174 --> 00:04:57.245
and many of our first wars were religious.

00:04:57.269 --> 00:04:59.580
Our flags were used on the battlefield

00:04:59.604 --> 00:05:03.874
to signify which side
of the battlefield we belonged to,

00:05:03.898 --> 00:05:08.172
because that was the only way
to be able to tell friend from foe.

00:05:08.196 --> 00:05:10.030
We all looked alike.

00:05:10.054 --> 00:05:15.134
And now our flags are on
mass-manufactured uniforms

00:05:15.158 --> 00:05:16.721
that we are making.

00:05:16.745 --> 00:05:19.755
Logos on products
to identify a maker came next,

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:26.263
and brands were given
legal recognition on January 1, 1876,

00:05:26.287 --> 00:05:29.078
with the advent of the Trademarks
Registration Act.

00:05:29.102 --> 00:05:33.566
The first trademarked brand was Bass Ale,

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.534
and I kind of wonder what that says
about our humanity

00:05:37.558 --> 00:05:41.801
that first trademarked brand
was an alcoholic beverage.

00:05:42.808 --> 00:05:44.815
Now, here is what I consider to be

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:48.580
the first case of branded
product placement.

00:05:48.604 --> 00:05:52.913
There are bottles of Bass Ale behind me

00:05:52.937 --> 00:05:55.510
with the logo accurately presented here

00:05:55.534 --> 00:06:00.939
in this very famous painting
in 1882 by Ã‰douard Manet.

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:07.572
One of the most widely recognized
logos in the world today

00:06:07.596 --> 00:06:09.288
is the Nike swoosh,

00:06:09.312 --> 00:06:12.733
which was introduced in 1971.

00:06:12.757 --> 00:06:15.355
Carolyn Davidson,
a graphic design student,

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:20.373
originally created the logo
for 35 dollars.

00:06:21.396 --> 00:06:26.765
Upon seeing it,
Nike CEO Phil Knight stated,

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:28.487
"I don't love it

00:06:28.511 --> 00:06:31.910
but maybe it will grow on me."

00:06:31.934 --> 00:06:34.012
Maybe it will grow on me.

00:06:34.621 --> 00:06:36.958
But why is the swoosh so popular?

00:06:36.982 --> 00:06:38.806
Why is the swoosh so popular?

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.439
Is it the mark?

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.994
Or is the marketing?

00:06:43.961 --> 00:06:47.061
And what can we make of the fact

00:06:47.085 --> 00:06:51.306
that the Nike swoosh seems to be

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.229
the Newport logo upside down

00:06:56.459 --> 00:06:59.742
or the Capital One logo on its side?

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:04.165
That is not the only logo
with a shared identity.

00:07:06.347 --> 00:07:11.965
This next logo is a logo
that has a shared identity

00:07:11.989 --> 00:07:14.536
with wholly different meanings.

00:07:15.108 --> 00:07:16.673
As a Jewish person,

00:07:16.697 --> 00:07:19.491
I believe that this logo,

00:07:19.515 --> 00:07:21.565
this swastika,

00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:24.780
is the most heinous logo of all time.

00:07:25.448 --> 00:07:28.995
But it actually has
a rather surprising trajectory.

00:07:29.453 --> 00:07:33.156
The word "swastika" originally comes from

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:37.187
the ancient Sanskrit word "svastika,"

00:07:37.211 --> 00:07:39.636
which actually means "good fortune,"

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.045
"luck" and "well-being."

00:07:42.701 --> 00:07:47.472
In the early 1900s,
before it was appropriated by Hitler,

00:07:47.496 --> 00:07:50.493
it was used by Coca-Cola

00:07:50.517 --> 00:07:53.139
on a good luck bottle opener.

00:07:53.163 --> 00:07:57.587
The American Biscuit Company
prominently registered the mark

00:07:57.611 --> 00:07:59.825
and put it on boxes of cookies.

00:07:59.849 --> 00:08:04.209
The US Playing Card Company
registered the mark in 1921

00:08:04.233 --> 00:08:06.339
for Fortune Playing Cards.

00:08:06.363 --> 00:08:10.970
The Boy Scouts used
the mark on shoes in 1910,

00:08:10.994 --> 00:08:17.606
and the symbol was also featured
on cigar labels, boxtops, road signs

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.535
and even poker chips.

00:08:19.559 --> 00:08:24.915
Even the Jain made use of the logo
along with a hand of God

00:08:24.939 --> 00:08:26.737
many millennia ago.

00:08:27.372 --> 00:08:29.540
These marks were identical,

00:08:29.564 --> 00:08:31.740
but with use as a Nazi symbol,

00:08:31.764 --> 00:08:34.711
the impact became very, very different.

00:08:35.322 --> 00:08:37.290
The hand of God,

00:08:37.314 --> 00:08:39.320
the Nike swoosh

00:08:39.344 --> 00:08:41.265
and the swastika:

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:46.967
they all demonstrate how we've been
manufacturing meaning with visual language

00:08:46.991 --> 00:08:48.773
over millennia.

00:08:49.524 --> 00:08:52.331
It's a behavior that's
almost as old as we are.

00:08:53.039 --> 00:08:55.386
Today, in the United States,

00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:00.509
there are over 116,000 malls,

00:09:00.533 --> 00:09:03.503
and they all look pretty much the same.

00:09:03.527 --> 00:09:07.240
There are more than 40,000 supermarkets,

00:09:07.264 --> 00:09:11.299
and they each have over 40,000 items.

00:09:11.323 --> 00:09:13.631
If you went shopping for bottled water,

00:09:13.655 --> 00:09:17.235
you'd have over 80 options to choose from.

00:09:17.259 --> 00:09:20.318
Since their launch in 1912,

00:09:20.342 --> 00:09:26.765
you could choose from over 100
flavors and variants of Oreo cookies.

00:09:27.495 --> 00:09:30.246
Now, is this a good thing

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:31.677
or is it a bad thing?

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:36.465
Is a plethora of choice
necessary in a free market?

00:09:36.967 --> 00:09:40.481
I believe it is both a good and bad thing,

00:09:40.505 --> 00:09:42.872
as humans are both good and bad,

00:09:42.896 --> 00:09:47.584
and we're the ones creating
and using and buying these brands.

00:09:47.608 --> 00:09:50.093
However, I think that the question

00:09:50.117 --> 00:09:55.739
of whether this behavior is good or bad
is actually secondary

00:09:55.763 --> 00:09:57.684
to understanding why --

00:09:58.545 --> 00:10:03.014
why we behave this way in the first place.

00:10:04.552 --> 00:10:05.719
Here's the thing:

00:10:06.917 --> 00:10:09.616
every one of our mass-marketed products

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:13.344
are what I consider to be top-down brands.

00:10:13.368 --> 00:10:16.136
They're still created by people,

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.974
but they are owned, operated,
manufactured, advertised,

00:10:20.998 --> 00:10:24.625
designed, promoted
and distributed by the corporation

00:10:24.649 --> 00:10:29.434
and pushed down and sold
to the consumer for financial gain.

00:10:29.458 --> 00:10:32.786
These corporations have
a responsibility to a P and L

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.247
with an expectation of an ROI

00:10:35.271 --> 00:10:41.409
and have names like P and G
and AT and T and J and J.

00:10:42.715 --> 00:10:47.586
And that's pretty much the way it's been
for the last couple of hundred years:

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:51.281
a top-down model
controlled by the corporation.

00:10:52.641 --> 00:10:55.646
Until 2011.

00:10:56.264 --> 00:10:59.821
That's when we began to see evidence

00:10:59.845 --> 00:11:04.413
of real, significant, far-reaching change.

00:11:04.437 --> 00:11:07.554
The Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street

00:11:07.578 --> 00:11:11.181
proved how the internet
could amplify messages

00:11:11.205 --> 00:11:13.558
and connect like-minded people

00:11:13.582 --> 00:11:16.576
with powerful beliefs to inspire change.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.967
We witnessed a cultural shift
via social media

00:11:19.991 --> 00:11:24.025
with hashtags like #MeToo
and #BlackLivesMatter.

00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:27.542
In its wake, the discipline of branding

00:11:27.566 --> 00:11:31.816
has transformed more in the last 10 years

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.921
than it has in the last 10,000,

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:39.142
and for the first time in modern history,

00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:41.847
the most popular, influential brands

00:11:41.871 --> 00:11:46.169
are not brands being pushed
down by the corporation.

00:11:46.193 --> 00:11:50.788
They are brands being pushed up
by the people, for the people,

00:11:50.812 --> 00:11:55.823
for the sole purpose of changing the world
and making it a better place.

00:11:55.847 --> 00:12:00.330
Our greatest innovations aren't brands
providing a different form

00:12:00.354 --> 00:12:02.976
or a different flavor
of our favorite snack.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.886
Our greatest innovations
are the creation of brands

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.984
that can make a difference in our lives

00:12:09.008 --> 00:12:12.362
and reflect the kind of world
that we want to live in.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.363
In November of 2016,

00:12:15.387 --> 00:12:18.170
Krista Suh, Jayna Zweiman and Kat Coyle

00:12:18.194 --> 00:12:23.365
created a hat to be worn
at the Women's March in Washington, DC.

00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:25.590
(Applause)

00:12:26.653 --> 00:12:30.109
This was the day after
the presidential inauguration.

00:12:30.133 --> 00:12:34.739
Two months later,
on January 21, 2017,

00:12:34.763 --> 00:12:40.884
millions of people all over the world
wore handmade pink pussyhats

00:12:40.908 --> 00:12:43.999
in support of the Women's March
all over the world.

00:12:44.967 --> 00:12:48.081
The hat was not created
for any financial benefit.

00:12:48.105 --> 00:12:51.967
Like our religious symbols
created thousands of years ago,

00:12:51.991 --> 00:12:54.988
the hat was created
by the people, for the people

00:12:55.012 --> 00:13:00.939
to serve what I believe
is the highest benefit of branding:

00:13:00.963 --> 00:13:03.426
to unite people in the communication

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:04.705
of shared ideals.

00:13:06.002 --> 00:13:09.232
The pink pussyhat became
a mark for a movement.

00:13:09.256 --> 00:13:13.145
In a very short time,
two months,

00:13:13.169 --> 00:13:15.997
it became universally recognizable.

00:13:16.642 --> 00:13:20.056
It connected an audience
in an unprecedented way.

00:13:21.042 --> 00:13:22.977
It is a brand,

00:13:23.001 --> 00:13:24.734
but it is more than that.

00:13:25.414 --> 00:13:28.556
Today, the pink pussyhat is proof positive

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:32.075
that branding is not just
a tool of capitalism.

00:13:33.162 --> 00:13:37.066
Branding is the profound
manifestation of the human spirit.

00:13:37.957 --> 00:13:44.924
The condition of branding has always
reflected the condition of our culture.

00:13:45.699 --> 00:13:47.786
It is our responsibility

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:52.791
to continue to leverage
the democratic power branding provides,

00:13:52.815 --> 00:13:54.734
and it is our responsibility

00:13:55.654 --> 00:13:57.720
to design a culture that reflects

00:13:58.911 --> 00:14:00.307
and honors

00:14:01.317 --> 00:14:03.190
the kind of world we want to live in.

00:14:03.741 --> 00:14:04.906
Thank you.

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:08.249
(Applause)
