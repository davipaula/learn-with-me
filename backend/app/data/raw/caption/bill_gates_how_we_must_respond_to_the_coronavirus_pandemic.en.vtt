Whitney Pennington Rodgers:
Hello and welcome to everyone

00:00:15.477 --> 00:00:17.055
joining us from around the globe.

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:20.429
Thank you for being part of day two
of our special series TED Connects.

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:24.394
This week, we're bringing you interviews
from some of the world's greatest minds

00:00:24.418 --> 00:00:26.989
to offer tools for us to navigate
through and thrive

00:00:27.013 --> 00:00:29.108
in these really uncertain times.

00:00:29.132 --> 00:00:32.179
I'm Whitney Pennington Rogers,
TED's current affairs curator,

00:00:32.203 --> 00:00:34.831
and I'll be one of your hosts
for today's event.

00:00:34.855 --> 00:00:36.585
Yesterday, we kicked off this series

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:39.768
with an interview from acclaimed
psychologist Susan David,

00:00:39.792 --> 00:00:42.754
who offered us some tips
on how to really be our best selves

00:00:42.778 --> 00:00:44.611
in these trying times.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.654
And we're going to switch gears
a little bit today

00:00:47.678 --> 00:00:50.484
from thinking about
our own personal mental health

00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:53.299
to the state of our global
public health systems.

00:00:53.323 --> 00:00:54.990
Chris Anderson: Thank you.

00:00:55.014 --> 00:00:59.117
I guess we have a pretty
exciting guest to introduce.

00:00:59.141 --> 00:01:02.535
On the other side of the country,
let's bring in Bill Gates.

00:01:03.336 --> 00:01:06.486
Bill, they say
the better-known people are,

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.768
the less you have to intro them.

00:01:08.792 --> 00:01:10.146
It's great to have you here.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.014
How are you doing?

00:01:13.768 --> 00:01:17.411
Bill Gates: I think this is
an unprecedented,

00:01:17.435 --> 00:01:20.003
really disconcerting time for everyone,

00:01:20.027 --> 00:01:22.046
with things being shut down,

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.219
not knowing exactly
how long it's going to last,

00:01:25.243 --> 00:01:28.177
worrying about the health
of all the people we care about.

00:01:29.974 --> 00:01:32.911
You know, I'm lucky
that I get to connect up

00:01:32.935 --> 00:01:36.061
with video conferencing using Teams a lot,

00:01:36.085 --> 00:01:39.233
so the Foundation is stepping up

00:01:39.257 --> 00:01:44.601
and there's a lot of great people
trying to help with this crisis.

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:46.492
But it's scary for everyone.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.066
CA: Are you basically stuck at home
like many of us watching?

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.719
BG: Yeah, almost all my meetings
are using Teams now,

00:01:55.743 --> 00:01:57.840
I'm getting used to that.

00:01:58.173 --> 00:02:04.134
You know, I've gone days
without seeing any coworkers.

00:02:04.585 --> 00:02:05.910
CA: Let's start here, Bill.

00:02:05.934 --> 00:02:10.276
Five years ago, you stood on the TED stage

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.895
and you gave this chilling warning

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:17.942
that the world was in danger,
at some point, of a major pandemic.

00:02:18.695 --> 00:02:20.395
People watching that talk now,

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:22.740
their hair stands up
on the back of their neck --

00:02:22.764 --> 00:02:24.839
it is exactly what we're living through.

00:02:24.863 --> 00:02:28.562
What happened, did people
listen to that warning at all?

00:02:29.903 --> 00:02:31.103
BG: Basically, no.

00:02:32.815 --> 00:02:38.812
You know, I was hopeful
that with the Zika and Ebola

00:02:38.836 --> 00:02:40.431
and SARS and MERS,

00:02:40.455 --> 00:02:42.927
they all reminded us

00:02:42.951 --> 00:02:46.622
that, particularly in a world
where people move around so much,

00:02:46.646 --> 00:02:49.892
you can get huge devastation.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.860
And so the talk was to say,

00:02:53.884 --> 00:02:56.210
hey, we're not ready
for the next pandemic,

00:02:56.234 --> 00:03:02.347
but in fact, there's advances in science
that if we put resources against them,

00:03:02.371 --> 00:03:03.878
we can be ready.

00:03:04.212 --> 00:03:06.387
Sadly, very little was done.

00:03:06.411 --> 00:03:07.642
There were some things --

00:03:07.666 --> 00:03:13.299
the Coalition for Epidemic
Preparedness Innovation, CEPI,

00:03:13.323 --> 00:03:16.555
was funded by our foundation,

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.053
Wellcome Trust
and a number of governments,

00:03:21.077 --> 00:03:25.076
to do some of the platform vaccine work,

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.584
but in the area of diagnostics,
antibodies, antivirals,

00:03:30.608 --> 00:03:33.467
basically doing the disease games
that I talked about,

00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:37.046
where we'd simulate
what needed to be done.

00:03:37.443 --> 00:03:39.025
We hardly did anything,

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.356
and so now here we have
a respiratory virus

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.512
that is, sadly, fulfilling some
of the more negative predictions I made.

00:03:50.338 --> 00:03:53.687
CA: Last month, you said
that this might be the big one.

00:03:53.711 --> 00:04:00.222
You wrote that this could be
the sort of once-in-a-century pandemic

00:04:00.246 --> 00:04:02.180
that people had been fearing.

00:04:02.511 --> 00:04:04.778
Is that how you think of it still?

00:04:05.127 --> 00:04:07.851
BG: Well, it's awful to say this,

00:04:07.875 --> 00:04:14.331
but we could have a respiratory virus
whose case fatality rate was even higher,

00:04:14.355 --> 00:04:16.656
if this was something like smallpox,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.689
you know, that kills 30 percent of people.

00:04:18.713 --> 00:04:20.800
So this is horrific.

00:04:21.173 --> 00:04:23.765
But in fact,

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:27.998
most people, even who get
the COVID disease,

00:04:28.022 --> 00:04:29.918
are able to survive.

00:04:29.942 --> 00:04:32.903
So it's quite infectious,

00:04:32.927 --> 00:04:36.804
way more infectious
than MERS or SARS were.

00:04:37.632 --> 00:04:39.861
It's not as fatal as they were.

00:04:40.838 --> 00:04:46.504
And yet, the disruption we're seeing,
in order to knock it down,

00:04:46.528 --> 00:04:50.024
is really completely unprecedented.

00:04:50.048 --> 00:04:54.106
So this is going global,

00:04:54.931 --> 00:04:56.153
that was --

00:04:56.177 --> 00:04:58.090
it's respiratory,

00:04:58.114 --> 00:04:59.955
that was the great fear.

00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:03.823
How many people end up dying --

00:05:03.847 --> 00:05:08.117
hopefully, if we do the right things,
it won't be a gigantic number.

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:14.933
So, you know, we should end up
not having the 1918 flu situation.

00:05:15.402 --> 00:05:17.690
We should be able to do
a lot better than that.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.100
CA: And that's because of actions
that we would take.

00:05:22.124 --> 00:05:25.926
I mean, left without the right actions,

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.913
the prospects are pretty deadly.

00:05:27.937 --> 00:05:31.866
If we knew what we knew in 1919,

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.339
this thing could take out
tens of millions of people

00:05:34.363 --> 00:05:35.513
around the world.

00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:37.553
You said --

00:05:37.577 --> 00:05:41.755
is the key thing here that it's got
this sort of a strange combination

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:44.379
of being certainly
more dangerous than flu --

00:05:44.403 --> 00:05:47.299
not as dangerous as something
like Ebola or SARS,

00:05:47.323 --> 00:05:52.109
but more dangerous than flu
by a factor, but infectious,

00:05:52.133 --> 00:05:56.188
and also infectious
before symptoms have started,

00:05:56.212 --> 00:06:00.370
is that part of why
it's been really hard to respond to?

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.450
BG: Right.

00:06:03.062 --> 00:06:05.149
Ebola,

00:06:05.173 --> 00:06:09.173
you're actually flat on your back
before you're very infectious.

00:06:09.197 --> 00:06:14.634
So you're not at church
or in a bus or at a store.

00:06:15.546 --> 00:06:22.149
With most respiratory viruses
like the flu and COVID,

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:25.887
at first you only feel a little bit
of a fever and a little bit sick,

00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:32.227
and so there's the possibility
you're going about your normal activities

00:06:32.251 --> 00:06:34.671
and infecting other people.

00:06:35.083 --> 00:06:39.100
And so human-to-human
transmissible respiratory viruses

00:06:39.124 --> 00:06:45.974
that in the early stage
aren't stopping you from doing things,

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.807
that's kind of a worst case,

00:06:47.831 --> 00:06:52.768
and that's where, you know,
I did a flu simulation in the 2015 talk

00:06:52.792 --> 00:06:54.958
and showed how quickly it spread.

00:06:54.982 --> 00:06:57.164
You know, versus 1918,

00:06:57.188 --> 00:07:01.617
people move around a lot more now
than they used to,

00:07:01.641 --> 00:07:03.323
and so that works against us.

00:07:03.347 --> 00:07:06.528
Now the medical system
that steps up to treat people

00:07:06.552 --> 00:07:08.053
is also far, far better.

00:07:08.077 --> 00:07:10.029
CA: But when was it clear to you

00:07:10.053 --> 00:07:16.042
that unless we acted,
this could be a really deadly pandemic?

00:07:17.235 --> 00:07:21.523
BG: Well, in January it was discussed

00:07:21.547 --> 00:07:24.878
that there was human-to-human
transmission taking place.

00:07:26.146 --> 00:07:32.162
And so the alarm bells were ringing

00:07:33.837 --> 00:07:37.554
that this fits the very scary pattern

00:07:37.578 --> 00:07:41.633
that it will be very difficult to contain.

00:07:42.189 --> 00:07:45.483
And on January 23,

00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:49.061
China did their equivalent
of the shutdown.

00:07:49.577 --> 00:07:51.799
Did it in a fairly extreme form.

00:07:52.506 --> 00:07:56.688
The very good news
is that they were able to reduce

00:07:56.712 --> 00:08:00.498
the infection rates dramatically

00:08:00.522 --> 00:08:02.501
because of those actions.

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:07.879
But it's January where everybody
should have been on notice --

00:08:07.903 --> 00:08:10.601
let's get our act together with testing,

00:08:10.625 --> 00:08:14.918
let's get going on
therapeutics and vaccines,

00:08:14.942 --> 00:08:16.374
we've got to get organized

00:08:16.398 --> 00:08:19.291
because we have this novel
respiratory virus

00:08:19.315 --> 00:08:25.140
whose infectiousness and fatality
put it in that superscary range.

00:08:26.053 --> 00:08:27.934
CA: And so, what did happen?

00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.606
Because it's such a mystery to me

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:33.920
about the "lost month" of preparations

00:08:33.944 --> 00:08:36.844
in many countries and certainly in the US,

00:08:36.868 --> 00:08:38.768
where we are.

00:08:38.792 --> 00:08:41.585
Were you on the phone to people

00:08:41.609 --> 00:08:45.022
during early February,
late January, early February,

00:08:45.046 --> 00:08:48.530
saying, "Guys, what's going on,

00:08:48.554 --> 00:08:50.704
this is a really big deal,
what are we doing?"

00:08:50.728 --> 00:08:53.815
What was happening behind the scenes
during that period?

00:08:55.006 --> 00:08:57.672
BG: Well, you'd like to have
government money show up

00:08:57.696 --> 00:08:58.918
for the key activities.

00:08:58.942 --> 00:09:02.218
We put out 100 million,

00:09:02.242 --> 00:09:05.307
we created the Therapeutics Accelerator,

00:09:05.331 --> 00:09:09.863
there's the period between
when we realized it was transmitting

00:09:09.887 --> 00:09:12.331
and now, where we should have done more.

00:09:12.355 --> 00:09:15.688
I think the most important thing
to discuss today

00:09:15.712 --> 00:09:19.403
is that in the area of testing,

00:09:19.427 --> 00:09:24.268
we're still not creating that capacity

00:09:24.292 --> 00:09:27.226
and applying it
to the people most in need.

00:09:27.546 --> 00:09:31.006
And so we have health workers
who are symptomatic,

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:33.251
who can't get a test

00:09:33.275 --> 00:09:36.299
and so they don't know
should they go in or not go in,

00:09:36.323 --> 00:09:37.760
and yet we have lots of tests

00:09:37.784 --> 00:09:40.464
being given to people
who aren't symptomatic.

00:09:40.488 --> 00:09:42.768
So the testing thing to me,

00:09:42.792 --> 00:09:47.714
it's got to be organized,
it's got to be prioritized,

00:09:47.738 --> 00:09:50.040
that is super, super urgent.

00:09:50.683 --> 00:09:52.690
The second thing is the isolation

00:09:52.714 --> 00:09:56.641
that, you know, various parts,
just focusing on the US,

00:09:56.665 --> 00:10:00.077
some parts are doing that
in a fairly strong way

00:10:00.101 --> 00:10:01.656
and other parts not yet,

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.910
and it's very hard to do,

00:10:03.934 --> 00:10:05.184
it's tough on people,

00:10:05.208 --> 00:10:08.683
it's disastrous for the economy.

00:10:09.903 --> 00:10:14.447
But the sooner you do it in a tough way,

00:10:14.471 --> 00:10:19.323
the sooner you can undo it
and go back to normal.

00:10:21.533 --> 00:10:24.045
CA: So we'll come
to the isolation part in a minute,

00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:26.053
but just sticking with the testing thing,

00:10:26.077 --> 00:10:31.387
I'm just so confused as to why,
with more than a month's notice --

00:10:31.411 --> 00:10:35.697
I mean, there are so many smart
epidemiologists in the US, for example,

00:10:35.721 --> 00:10:38.622
you plug numbers
about infectiousness and fatality

00:10:38.646 --> 00:10:39.864
into any simulation

00:10:39.888 --> 00:10:41.903
and you see that if you don't do anything,

00:10:41.927 --> 00:10:43.617
millions of people will die.

00:10:43.641 --> 00:10:44.815
And there's a month.

00:10:44.839 --> 00:10:48.092
So what's your explanation,

00:10:48.116 --> 00:10:52.298
what do you think happened here
as to why there was almost no --

00:10:52.322 --> 00:10:53.490
a month later,

00:10:53.514 --> 00:10:56.133
there was no viable test in the US.

00:10:56.157 --> 00:10:59.199
Was this just government complexity,

00:10:59.223 --> 00:11:01.435
too many chefs in the kitchen,

00:11:01.459 --> 00:11:03.714
what on earth happened here?

00:11:04.595 --> 00:11:09.309
BG: Well, we certainly didn't take
advantage of the month of February.

00:11:09.333 --> 00:11:12.893
The good news is that the actual process,

00:11:12.917 --> 00:11:16.871
the PCR machines,

00:11:16.895 --> 00:11:19.228
we have a lot in the United States.

00:11:19.736 --> 00:11:22.878
And so there's models like South Korea,

00:11:22.902 --> 00:11:25.164
who took advantage of February,

00:11:25.188 --> 00:11:27.393
built up the testing capacity,

00:11:27.417 --> 00:11:32.144
and they were able to contact-trace
and their infections have gone down,

00:11:32.168 --> 00:11:34.831
even without the type of shutdown

00:11:34.855 --> 00:11:37.815
that, because we're late,
we're having to do.

00:11:38.141 --> 00:11:41.644
One thing that is good news just this week

00:11:41.668 --> 00:11:46.109
is that people had thought
to do this test,

00:11:46.133 --> 00:11:50.649
that you had to have a nurse or doctor
shove a swab way up,

00:11:50.673 --> 00:11:52.577
all the way to the back of your throat,

00:11:52.601 --> 00:11:53.816
which hurts a lot,

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.255
but also, you're going to cough

00:11:56.279 --> 00:11:59.633
and potentially spread the disease
to that health care worker.

00:11:59.657 --> 00:12:01.657
So they have to have protective equipment

00:12:01.681 --> 00:12:02.887
and change that.

00:12:02.911 --> 00:12:07.252
We sent data to the FDA this weekend,

00:12:07.276 --> 00:12:10.972
showing that just
an individual, by themselves,

00:12:10.996 --> 00:12:13.329
swabbing up to the tip of their nose,

00:12:15.397 --> 00:12:18.683
the accuracy of that test

00:12:18.707 --> 00:12:22.334
is essentially the same
as having a health care worker do it.

00:12:22.358 --> 00:12:24.472
That helps a lot.

00:12:25.038 --> 00:12:26.633
We still have to do other things,

00:12:26.657 --> 00:12:31.045
but that means that you
don't have to change protective equipment,

00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:33.649
you just hand the patient that swab,

00:12:33.673 --> 00:12:35.545
they do it, put it in the test tube,

00:12:35.569 --> 00:12:38.458
and if the capacity is right,

00:12:38.482 --> 00:12:41.672
within 24 hours,
you should get that result back.

00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:43.951
CA: So how do you see that playing out?

00:12:43.975 --> 00:12:48.800
Are there people going to massively
scale those tests

00:12:48.824 --> 00:12:54.141
and how will ordinary citizens
be able to get hold of them?

00:12:54.165 --> 00:12:57.468
Does it still have to be kind of
prescribed by a doctor at some point,

00:12:57.492 --> 00:13:01.942
or at some point, will you be able
to order them off Amazon or something?

00:13:01.966 --> 00:13:06.304
BG: Well, it's pretty chaotic today,
because the government hasn't stepped in

00:13:06.328 --> 00:13:09.442
to make sure the testing capacity
is both increased

00:13:09.466 --> 00:13:11.732
and it's used for the right cases.

00:13:12.151 --> 00:13:15.236
There will be a website --

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.807
and if the federal
government doesn't do it,

00:13:17.831 --> 00:13:20.115
a lot of local governments
will have to do it --

00:13:20.139 --> 00:13:23.877
that you go to, you give your situation,
including your symptoms,

00:13:23.901 --> 00:13:28.012
you're told, based on your work
and your symptoms,

00:13:28.036 --> 00:13:29.211
are you a priority.

00:13:29.235 --> 00:13:33.815
If so, you're told where
there are kiosks you can go to

00:13:33.839 --> 00:13:37.078
and you'll do the self-swab
and just hand it over,

00:13:37.102 --> 00:13:42.712
or eventually, we'll send
the kits to you at home,

00:13:42.736 --> 00:13:47.307
and then you'll send it back
and hear that result.

00:13:47.331 --> 00:13:48.664
Maybe six months from now,

00:13:48.688 --> 00:13:52.189
you'll actually have a strip
where you perform the test in the home,

00:13:52.213 --> 00:13:56.062
but for now, they're sending it back
for the PCR processing.

00:13:56.086 --> 00:13:59.284
We can have massive capacity there.

00:13:59.308 --> 00:14:01.426
And that's how you know.

00:14:01.927 --> 00:14:03.537
The testing is everything,

00:14:03.561 --> 00:14:07.585
because that's how you know
whether you need to do more shutdown

00:14:07.609 --> 00:14:10.641
or you're starting to get to the point
where you can relieve it.

00:14:10.665 --> 00:14:12.545
CA: Some people are trying to argue now

00:14:12.569 --> 00:14:15.497
that, almost, the testing
should be dialed back,

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:17.585
because the cat is out of the bag,

00:14:17.609 --> 00:14:20.926
testing is bringing people together
and risking infection,

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:23.577
you know, forget that,
let's just focus on treatment

00:14:23.601 --> 00:14:26.386
and on isolation strategies.

00:14:27.101 --> 00:14:28.260
You disagree with that.

00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:31.776
Testing is still absolutely essential
and needs to be scaled dramatically.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.355
BG: The two that go together are testing,

00:14:34.379 --> 00:14:35.934
at very high volume,

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.204
and the isolation piece.

00:14:38.228 --> 00:14:39.974
If you're a medical worker,

00:14:39.998 --> 00:14:42.124
you want to stay and do your job.

00:14:42.148 --> 00:14:46.323
If you're making sure
the electricity, water, food

00:14:46.347 --> 00:14:48.506
is still available,

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:49.942
you want to do your job,

00:14:49.966 --> 00:14:54.053
and so testing is what indicates to you,

00:14:54.077 --> 00:14:56.636
do you need to go into isolation

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.458
and make sure you're not
the source of spread.

00:14:59.482 --> 00:15:04.981
And so, you know,
testing is the key thing.

00:15:05.752 --> 00:15:09.712
South Korea did that in this massive way

00:15:09.736 --> 00:15:13.087
that everybody should learn from.

00:15:13.524 --> 00:15:19.103
And so that is paired
with the isolation piece.

00:15:19.405 --> 00:15:22.603
Our goal here is to get to the point

00:15:22.627 --> 00:15:26.947
where a very small percentage
of the population is infected.

00:15:26.971 --> 00:15:31.439
You know, China, only 0.01 percent
of the population was infected.

00:15:31.773 --> 00:15:32.924
If you let it,

00:15:32.948 --> 00:15:34.426
if you don't do these things,

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:37.751
you're going to get
the majority of people infected

00:15:37.775 --> 00:15:41.680
and that huge overload
of the medical system.

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:46.982
CA: Whitney has some questions
from our online audience. Whitney.

00:15:47.006 --> 00:15:49.117
WPR: Some of the questions
that we're seeing

00:15:49.141 --> 00:15:51.466
are about how our tech giants and leaders

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:56.259
can play a role in isolating this
and containing this virus.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.050
BG: The tech companies are very involved

00:15:59.074 --> 00:16:01.704
in making sure that some work can go on.

00:16:02.482 --> 00:16:04.608
People can stay in touch,

00:16:04.632 --> 00:16:07.363
you know, they can help
with some of the disease modeling,

00:16:07.387 --> 00:16:09.776
they can help with
the visibility of the numbers.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.498
It's actually very impressive,

00:16:11.522 --> 00:16:14.220
you get up there
and you can see those numbers.

00:16:14.244 --> 00:16:15.736
Actually, they're sad numbers,

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.768
but everybody's able
to monitor this thing.

00:16:19.792 --> 00:16:24.449
Back in 1918, they didn't have
this type of visibility,

00:16:24.473 --> 00:16:29.496
and ability to share best practices.

00:16:29.805 --> 00:16:33.282
But for a lot of people,
the isolation is the key thing.

00:16:33.306 --> 00:16:39.371
CA: Bill, one of the riddles
about this isolation strategy

00:16:39.395 --> 00:16:42.994
is how long it has to last.

00:16:43.018 --> 00:16:45.638
A lot of people are concerned

00:16:45.662 --> 00:16:50.188
that the price of victory
by isolating everyone

00:16:50.212 --> 00:16:51.665
is that you crash the economy,

00:16:51.689 --> 00:16:55.036
and that we have to be, basically,

00:16:55.060 --> 00:17:00.948
at home, not doing our regular jobs
for three, six months, maybe all year.

00:17:00.972 --> 00:17:03.688
And so much so that there's now
this big debate in the US

00:17:03.712 --> 00:17:04.980
and other countries

00:17:05.004 --> 00:17:07.038
about this may just be the wrong strategy,

00:17:07.062 --> 00:17:09.371
that we can't crash
the economy that badly,

00:17:09.395 --> 00:17:11.998
we should only isolate
for another couple of weeks,

00:17:12.022 --> 00:17:13.514
and then let people back,

00:17:13.538 --> 00:17:16.291
and if that means
a lot of other people get sick

00:17:16.315 --> 00:17:18.289
and we eventually build up herd immunity,

00:17:18.313 --> 00:17:20.029
that may be the right way to go.

00:17:20.053 --> 00:17:21.387
What's your thought on this,

00:17:21.411 --> 00:17:23.917
what is the isolation strategy

00:17:23.941 --> 00:17:27.402
that eventually leads to us
getting back to normal?

00:17:28.022 --> 00:17:32.022
BG: It's very tough to say to people,

00:17:32.046 --> 00:17:34.291
"Hey, keep going to restaurants,"

00:17:34.315 --> 00:17:37.410
you know, "Go buy new houses,

00:17:37.434 --> 00:17:41.133
ignore that pile of bodies
over in the corner,

00:17:41.157 --> 00:17:43.364
just, you know, we want you
to keep spending,"

00:17:43.388 --> 00:17:45.990
because there's some, maybe a politician

00:17:46.014 --> 00:17:49.751
who thinks GDP growth
is what really counts.

00:17:49.775 --> 00:17:53.874
It's very hard to tell people,
when there's an epidemic spreading

00:17:53.898 --> 00:17:58.947
that threatens,
particularly, their parents

00:17:58.971 --> 00:18:01.082
or elderly people that they know,

00:18:01.106 --> 00:18:02.965
that they should go about things

00:18:02.989 --> 00:18:06.695
knowing that their activity
is spreading this disease.

00:18:07.648 --> 00:18:11.712
I don't know of any rich countries
that have chosen to use that approach.

00:18:11.736 --> 00:18:14.420
It is true, if you did that approach,

00:18:14.444 --> 00:18:17.180
over a period of several years,

00:18:17.204 --> 00:18:20.543
enough people would be infected
you'd have what's called herd immunity.

00:18:20.567 --> 00:18:25.299
But herd immunity is meaningless
until you infect over half the population.

00:18:25.323 --> 00:18:26.918
And so you can take --

00:18:26.942 --> 00:18:28.704
You'll overload your medical system,

00:18:28.728 --> 00:18:31.442
so your case fatality rate,
instead of being one percent,

00:18:31.466 --> 00:18:33.349
will be like three, four percent.

00:18:34.658 --> 00:18:36.514
And so,

00:18:36.538 --> 00:18:40.293
the idea, it's very irresponsible

00:18:40.317 --> 00:18:43.436
for somebody to suggest
we can have the best of both worlds.

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:46.816
What we need is the extreme shutdown

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.871
so that in six to ten weeks,

00:18:49.895 --> 00:18:51.347
if things go well,

00:18:51.371 --> 00:18:53.934
then you can start opening back up.

00:18:54.847 --> 00:18:58.078
CA: So just putting the math together
from what you just said, Bill,

00:18:58.102 --> 00:18:59.348
to get to herd immunity,

00:18:59.372 --> 00:19:01.688
you need more than half
the people in the country

00:19:01.712 --> 00:19:03.125
to basically get the bug.

00:19:03.149 --> 00:19:05.026
So in the case of the US, for example,

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:07.253
that would be 150 million
people, thereabouts.

00:19:07.277 --> 00:19:10.513
You said that the fatality rate
in that scenario,

00:19:10.537 --> 00:19:14.362
you're talking about four
to five million people

00:19:14.386 --> 00:19:17.553
potential fatalities.

00:19:17.577 --> 00:19:22.022
That is just a horrifying scenario
that no one should be contemplating.

00:19:22.046 --> 00:19:24.656
BG: Even one percent
of the population getting sick,

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:30.578
they will treat, whoever goes
for this "ignore the disease" strategy,

00:19:30.602 --> 00:19:32.492
they will treat them as a pariah state,

00:19:32.516 --> 00:19:35.180
so none of their people will go in,

00:19:35.204 --> 00:19:37.950
and none of your people will go into that.

00:19:37.974 --> 00:19:42.507
And so briefly, a few countries in Europe
that hadn't really looked at this hard,

00:19:42.531 --> 00:19:47.450
considered, "OK, should we be the ones
who kind of go about business as usual?"

00:19:47.474 --> 00:19:50.619
It is tempting,
because if you got there early --

00:19:50.643 --> 00:19:53.822
South Korea did not have to do
the extreme shutdown,

00:19:53.846 --> 00:19:56.463
because they did
such a good job on testing.

00:19:57.496 --> 00:19:58.933
CA: Testing and containment.

00:19:58.957 --> 00:20:01.066
BG: That's why it's so maddening to me

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:05.482
that government
is not allocating the testing

00:20:05.506 --> 00:20:09.355
to where it's needed,

00:20:09.379 --> 00:20:11.921
and maybe that will have to happen
at the state level,

00:20:11.945 --> 00:20:14.403
because it's not happening
at the federal level.

00:20:14.427 --> 00:20:18.283
But there is no middle course
on this thing.

00:20:19.109 --> 00:20:23.329
It is sad that the shutdown
will be harder for poorer countries

00:20:23.353 --> 00:20:25.487
than it is for richer countries.

00:20:26.125 --> 00:20:28.347
CA: So let's come into that in minute.

00:20:28.371 --> 00:20:31.085
The one exception I've heard
the case made for is Japan,

00:20:31.109 --> 00:20:35.236
that Japan has not contained it
quite in the same way

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.037
that South Korea did

00:20:37.061 --> 00:20:38.560
but has allowed people to work.

00:20:38.584 --> 00:20:40.283
It's tried to make extreme measures

00:20:40.307 --> 00:20:43.449
for protecting their most
elderly population.

00:20:43.473 --> 00:20:49.429
But they've tried to find
a middle scenario, haven't they?

00:20:50.125 --> 00:20:51.974
BG: If you act --

00:20:52.879 --> 00:20:57.688
When you have hundreds of cases,

00:20:57.712 --> 00:21:01.736
you may be able to contain it
by doing great testing

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.918
and great contact tracing,

00:21:03.942 --> 00:21:06.577
and restricting foreigners coming in,

00:21:06.601 --> 00:21:08.868
without as much damage to your economy.

00:21:09.204 --> 00:21:15.847
The US is past this opportunity
to control without shutdown.

00:21:15.871 --> 00:21:22.586
So the worst case of what was happening
in Wuhan in the beginning

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:27.074
or in northern Italy
over the last few weeks,

00:21:27.098 --> 00:21:29.744
that we avoid that.

00:21:29.768 --> 00:21:36.593
But we did not act fast enough
to have an ability to avoid the shutdown.

00:21:36.617 --> 00:21:40.283
CA: But then what I don't understand,
in the case of the US, for example,

00:21:40.307 --> 00:21:43.609
is that even if we're successful

00:21:43.633 --> 00:21:47.109
in bending the curve and reducing
the number of new cases

00:21:47.133 --> 00:21:50.437
from a period of extreme
shutdown, as it were,

00:21:50.461 --> 00:21:53.367
no immunity has been built up.

00:21:53.391 --> 00:21:55.323
Let's say that there's still no vaccine.

00:21:55.347 --> 00:21:58.956
Surely when you lift restrictions
and people start going back to work,

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.380
the whole thing just blows up again.

00:22:01.919 --> 00:22:08.847
BG: The experience that we're seeing
in China and in South Korea

00:22:09.934 --> 00:22:14.188
is that there are not these people
who are asymptomatic

00:22:14.212 --> 00:22:15.967
that are causing lots of infections.

00:22:15.991 --> 00:22:17.450
And that's a parameter

00:22:17.474 --> 00:22:22.100
that, as you build the model,
you have to put in.

00:22:22.124 --> 00:22:25.345
There's an Imperial model
that people talk about a lot,

00:22:25.369 --> 00:22:28.687
which shows that reopening
is very hard to do.

00:22:29.584 --> 00:22:34.146
But the results of that model
are not matching what we see in China,

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:36.621
and so very likely,

00:22:36.645 --> 00:22:40.379
there aren't as many
of these infecting asymptomatics.

00:22:40.403 --> 00:22:42.903
And that's why you have to be pragmatic.

00:22:42.927 --> 00:22:44.307
There's a lot we don't know.

00:22:44.331 --> 00:22:47.933
For example, seasonality
may help us in the Northern Hemisphere,

00:22:47.957 --> 00:22:50.172
the force of infection will --

00:22:50.673 --> 00:22:56.643
Respiratory viruses,
to some degree, they all are seasonal.

00:22:56.667 --> 00:23:00.117
We don't know how seasonal this one is,

00:23:00.141 --> 00:23:03.381
but you know, there's a reasonable chance

00:23:03.405 --> 00:23:06.007
that the force of infection
will be going down.

00:23:06.031 --> 00:23:09.460
And it's your testing
that always is telling you,

00:23:09.484 --> 00:23:12.807
"Oh, my gosh, do I have to shut down more,

00:23:12.831 --> 00:23:14.158
or can I start to open up?"

00:23:14.182 --> 00:23:16.585
So particularly, right as you open up,

00:23:16.609 --> 00:23:20.951
that testing and contact tracing
is saying to you --

00:23:20.975 --> 00:23:25.204
And you can say I'm more
on the optimistic side,

00:23:25.228 --> 00:23:28.345
that it will be possible to do
what China's doing,

00:23:28.369 --> 00:23:32.646
where they are starting
to go back to normal.

00:23:33.163 --> 00:23:35.369
CA: And help me understand
what happened there

00:23:35.393 --> 00:23:37.490
because it seems kind of miraculous to me,

00:23:37.514 --> 00:23:40.458
because this virus was exploding,

00:23:40.482 --> 00:23:46.929
yes, in Wuhan, but people moved from there
to many other parts of China.

00:23:46.953 --> 00:23:48.311
How is it possible

00:23:48.335 --> 00:23:51.341
that the combination
of the shutdown in Wuhan

00:23:51.365 --> 00:23:52.794
and measures elsewhere

00:23:52.818 --> 00:23:55.436
seem to have got to the point
where there are literally

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:57.334
no new cases happening.

00:23:57.358 --> 00:23:59.363
I mean, to me,
that implies that literally,

00:23:59.387 --> 00:24:06.251
the virus is not circulating at all
between humans in China.

00:24:06.275 --> 00:24:09.212
You know, there's a few tourists
coming in who they deal with,

00:24:09.236 --> 00:24:13.879
but I mean, is that literally
your interpretation of what happened,

00:24:13.903 --> 00:24:15.974
that it's no longer circulating in China?

00:24:15.998 --> 00:24:17.149
BG: Absolutely.

00:24:17.173 --> 00:24:19.545
Take a spreadsheet
and take a number like four --

00:24:19.569 --> 00:24:21.672
one person infects four people --

00:24:21.696 --> 00:24:24.870
and say the cycle is every 10 days.

00:24:24.894 --> 00:24:29.101
Go through eight of those cycles,

00:24:29.125 --> 00:24:31.736
and you're getting the big number.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:36.244
You know, start with 10,000 and then,

00:24:36.268 --> 00:24:37.490
you know, that increase.

00:24:37.514 --> 00:24:40.228
If you take the number 0.4 instead,

00:24:40.252 --> 00:24:44.904
that is, the average case
infects 0.4 people,

00:24:44.928 --> 00:24:48.213
then look at what happens
to that number as you go out.

00:24:48.237 --> 00:24:49.820
It drops to zero,

00:24:49.844 --> 00:24:55.407
and so things that are exponential
are very, very dramatic.

00:24:55.431 --> 00:24:59.518
When they're above one,
they are growing rapidly.

00:24:59.542 --> 00:25:02.998
When they're below one,
they are shrinking rapidly.

00:25:03.022 --> 00:25:06.077
And so the isolation in China

00:25:06.101 --> 00:25:10.529
drove that reproductive number
to well below zero.

00:25:10.553 --> 00:25:12.094
And so local infection rates --

00:25:12.118 --> 00:25:13.533
CA: Below one.

00:25:14.153 --> 00:25:16.276
BG: Below one, sorry.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:21.323
And that quarantine,

00:25:21.347 --> 00:25:24.084
you know, quarantine comes from "40 days,"

00:25:24.108 --> 00:25:27.887
which is what they thought
would help for black plague,

00:25:27.911 --> 00:25:29.807
that is our primary technique.

00:25:29.831 --> 00:25:34.117
Thank God we have testing,
if we use it properly.

00:25:34.141 --> 00:25:36.641
We are doing therapeutics,

00:25:36.665 --> 00:25:38.403
which will help with the death rate,

00:25:38.427 --> 00:25:42.577
but in terms of keeping the infections
below one percent of the population,

00:25:42.601 --> 00:25:45.288
it really all depends
just on the two things:

00:25:45.312 --> 00:25:46.891
isolation and testing.

00:25:47.498 --> 00:25:51.688
CA: So to quote a question from
my Twitter feed this morning for you Bill:

00:25:51.712 --> 00:25:56.347
If you were president
for a month in the US,

00:25:56.371 --> 00:25:59.855
what would be the top
two or three things you would do?

00:26:00.474 --> 00:26:02.728
BG: Well, the clear message

00:26:02.752 --> 00:26:06.291
that we have no choice
to maintain this isolation

00:26:06.315 --> 00:26:11.331
and that's going to keep going
for a period of time,

00:26:11.355 --> 00:26:15.926
you know, probably in the Chinese case,
it was like six weeks,

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:17.926
so we have to prepare ourselves for that,

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:19.285
and do it very well.

00:26:19.309 --> 00:26:22.204
And then use the testing

00:26:22.228 --> 00:26:25.586
and every week, talk about
what's going on with that.

00:26:26.117 --> 00:26:30.715
If you're doing isolation well,
within about 20 days,

00:26:30.739 --> 00:26:33.879
you'll see those numbers really change,

00:26:33.903 --> 00:26:36.790
you know, instead of this,
you'll see this,

00:26:36.814 --> 00:26:39.853
and that is a sign
that you're on your way.

00:26:39.877 --> 00:26:44.237
Now, you have to stay
to get more generations

00:26:44.261 --> 00:26:48.732
that are 0.4 infections
per previous infection.

00:26:48.756 --> 00:26:51.383
You have to maintain it
for a number of weeks there.

00:26:51.725 --> 00:26:52.889
And you know,

00:26:52.913 --> 00:26:55.470
so this is not going to be easy.

00:26:55.494 --> 00:26:57.886
We need a clear message about that.

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:01.053
It is really tragic
that the economic effects of this

00:27:01.077 --> 00:27:02.633
are very dramatic.

00:27:02.657 --> 00:27:06.395
I mean, nothing like this
has ever happened to the economy

00:27:06.419 --> 00:27:09.002
in our lifetimes.

00:27:09.026 --> 00:27:12.653
But bringing the economy back
and doing money,

00:27:12.677 --> 00:27:19.035
that's more of a reversible thing
than bringing people back to life.

00:27:19.059 --> 00:27:23.426
And so, we're going to take the pain
in the economic dimension,

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:24.781
huge pain,

00:27:24.805 --> 00:27:29.602
in order to minimize the pain
in the disease and death dimension.

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:31.680
CA: Whitney.

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.633
WPR: We have a lot
of other questions coming in.

00:27:34.657 --> 00:27:36.276
One that we've been seeing

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.269
is a question about what tools
are available for countries

00:27:39.293 --> 00:27:43.037
that maybe don't have the luxury
of being able to social-distance,

00:27:43.061 --> 00:27:45.577
don't have great health systems in place,

00:27:45.601 --> 00:27:48.201
how should they be handling this virus?

00:27:49.212 --> 00:27:51.831
BG: Yeah, I would say,

00:27:51.855 --> 00:27:54.395
if the rich countries
really do their job well,

00:27:54.419 --> 00:28:00.260
by the summer, they'll be like China is,

00:28:00.284 --> 00:28:03.545
or some of the other countries
that responded early.

00:28:03.569 --> 00:28:06.593
But in the developing countries,

00:28:06.617 --> 00:28:08.537
particularly in the Southern Hemisphere,

00:28:08.561 --> 00:28:10.910
the seasonality is large.

00:28:11.585 --> 00:28:14.863
As you say, the ability to isolate,

00:28:14.887 --> 00:28:18.776
you know, when you go out
to get your food every day,

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.283
you have to earn your wage,

00:28:20.307 --> 00:28:23.399
when you live in a slum
or you're very nearby each other,

00:28:23.423 --> 00:28:25.545
it's very hard to do,

00:28:25.569 --> 00:28:28.736
as you move down the income ladder,

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:33.014
than it is for a country
like the United States.

00:28:33.038 --> 00:28:36.553
And so we should all
accelerate the vaccine,

00:28:36.577 --> 00:28:39.138
which eventually will come,

00:28:39.162 --> 00:28:41.466
and you know, people
are being responsible to say

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:45.507
that that's going to take 18 months.

00:28:45.531 --> 00:28:49.347
And there's a lot of those being pursued.

00:28:49.864 --> 00:28:51.928
I'm talking a lot with Seth Berkley,

00:28:51.952 --> 00:28:54.690
who you're going to have later this week,

00:28:54.714 --> 00:28:58.746
who can talk a lot
about the vaccine front,

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:02.071
because he's definitely
at the center of that,

00:29:02.095 --> 00:29:04.301
being the head of GAVI.

00:29:04.325 --> 00:29:09.379
We do need to get really cheap testing
out to these countries,

00:29:09.403 --> 00:29:10.974
and we need to get therapeutics

00:29:10.998 --> 00:29:14.180
so you don't need to put
five percent of people on respirators.

00:29:14.204 --> 00:29:16.086
Because even if they had the equipment,

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:17.553
they don't have the personnel,

00:29:17.577 --> 00:29:20.815
they just don't have
the beds, the capacity.

00:29:20.839 --> 00:29:25.212
And so the only good news
is that the rich countries have this

00:29:25.236 --> 00:29:30.776
and so they will be learning
about testing, therapeutics,

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.975
and funding the vaccines
for the entire world,

00:29:33.999 --> 00:29:38.554
to try and minimize the damage
in developing countries.

00:29:40.209 --> 00:29:42.938
WPR: Great, I'll be back later
with more questions.

00:29:42.962 --> 00:29:45.875
CA: Bill, you mentioned
therapeutics there.

00:29:45.899 --> 00:29:48.596
What is looking promising,

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.620
is anything looking promising?

00:29:51.149 --> 00:29:54.815
BG: Yeah, so there's quite
a range of things going on.

00:29:55.601 --> 00:29:58.414
There's a few that get mentioned a lot,

00:29:58.438 --> 00:30:02.680
remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine,
azithromycin,

00:30:02.704 --> 00:30:05.053
and the data is still a bit confusing,

00:30:05.077 --> 00:30:08.037
but there's some positive data on those.

00:30:08.061 --> 00:30:12.268
Remdesivir is a five-day IV infusion,

00:30:12.292 --> 00:30:14.731
and actually kind of hard to manufacture,

00:30:14.755 --> 00:30:17.696
so people are looking
at how that can be improved.

00:30:19.147 --> 00:30:21.841
The hydroxychloroquine looks like
it works, somewhat,

00:30:21.865 --> 00:30:23.218
if you get in early.

00:30:23.242 --> 00:30:27.401
There's a huge list of compounds,
including antibodies,

00:30:27.425 --> 00:30:29.093
antiviral drugs,

00:30:29.117 --> 00:30:33.918
and so the Gates Foundation
and Wellcome Trust,

00:30:33.942 --> 00:30:36.363
with support from Mastercard
and now others,

00:30:36.387 --> 00:30:41.308
created this therapeutics accelerator
to really triage out.

00:30:41.332 --> 00:30:44.881
You have hundreds of people showing up
and saying, try this, try that.

00:30:44.905 --> 00:30:48.046
So we look at lab assays, animal models,

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:51.197
and so we understand which things
should be prioritized

00:30:51.221 --> 00:30:53.871
for these very quick human trials

00:30:53.895 --> 00:30:55.816
that need to be done all over the world.

00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:01.516
So the coordination on that
is very complex, globally.

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:05.936
But I think, you know,
out of the top 20 or so candidates,

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:09.111
probably three or four of them
will work out,

00:31:09.135 --> 00:31:11.412
you know, at different
stages of the disease,

00:31:11.436 --> 00:31:14.858
to reduce the respiratory distress.

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:17.617
CA: I heard you mentioned
that one possibility

00:31:17.641 --> 00:31:21.664
might be treatments
from the serum, the blood serum,

00:31:21.688 --> 00:31:25.774
of people who had had
the disease and recovered.

00:31:25.798 --> 00:31:27.696
So I guess they're carrying antibodies.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.784
Talk a bit about that, how that could work

00:31:29.808 --> 00:31:32.029
and what it would take to accelerate that.

00:31:33.337 --> 00:31:38.099
BG: Yeah, this has always been discussed
as how could you pull that off.

00:31:38.123 --> 00:31:41.892
So people who are recovered,

00:31:41.916 --> 00:31:43.067
it appears,

00:31:43.091 --> 00:31:46.879
have really effective
antibodies in their blood.

00:31:46.903 --> 00:31:48.410
So you could go,

00:31:48.434 --> 00:31:54.641
transfuse them and only take out
the white cells, the immune cells.

00:31:54.665 --> 00:31:55.967
And then the question is,

00:31:55.991 --> 00:31:59.509
OK, how many patients' worth
of material could you get?

00:31:59.824 --> 00:32:02.278
You know, if you have
that recovered person come in,

00:32:02.302 --> 00:32:03.821
say, once a week,

00:32:03.845 --> 00:32:07.022
do you get enough
for two people or five people?

00:32:07.046 --> 00:32:12.720
Then logistically, you have to take that
and get it to where that need is.

00:32:12.744 --> 00:32:15.783
And so it's fairly complicated,

00:32:15.807 --> 00:32:19.649
you know, compared to a drug
that we can make in high volume.

00:32:19.673 --> 00:32:24.341
You know, the cost of taking it out
and putting it back in

00:32:24.365 --> 00:32:27.158
probably doesn't scale as well.

00:32:27.182 --> 00:32:30.197
But there is work being done on this.

00:32:30.833 --> 00:32:32.823
You know, we actually started with Ebola,

00:32:32.847 --> 00:32:38.614
and fortunately, it got done
before it was needed.

00:32:39.059 --> 00:32:41.656
So that is being pursued

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.950
and it will work to some degree,

00:32:43.974 --> 00:32:47.776
but it will be hard to scale the numbers.

00:32:48.372 --> 00:32:49.973
CA: So it's almost like,

00:32:49.997 --> 00:32:52.395
when you talk about the need
to accelerate testing,

00:32:52.419 --> 00:32:55.348
the immediate need
is for testing for the virus.

00:32:55.372 --> 00:32:57.570
But is it possible
that in a few months' time,

00:32:57.594 --> 00:33:01.252
there's going to be this growing need
to test for these antibodies in people,

00:33:01.276 --> 00:33:04.554
i.e. to see if someone
had the disease and recovered,

00:33:04.578 --> 00:33:06.586
maybe they didn't even know they had it.

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:10.943
Because you could picture
this growing worldwide force of heroes --

00:33:10.967 --> 00:33:12.225
let's call them heroes --

00:33:12.249 --> 00:33:14.252
who have been through this experience

00:33:14.276 --> 00:33:15.910
and have a lot to offer the world.

00:33:15.934 --> 00:33:18.982
Maybe they can offer
blood donation, serum donation.

00:33:19.719 --> 00:33:21.013
But also other tasks,

00:33:21.037 --> 00:33:23.830
like, if you've got overwhelmed
health care systems,

00:33:23.854 --> 00:33:27.553
presumably, there are kind of
community health worker type tasks

00:33:27.577 --> 00:33:30.649
that people could be trained to do
to relieve the pressure there,

00:33:30.673 --> 00:33:33.292
if we knew that they were
effectively immune?

00:33:33.633 --> 00:33:34.784
BG: Yes.

00:33:34.808 --> 00:33:38.299
Until we came up with the self-swab

00:33:38.323 --> 00:33:40.934
and showed FDA that that's equivalent,

00:33:40.958 --> 00:33:44.307
we were thinking that people
who might be able to man those kiosks

00:33:44.331 --> 00:33:46.179
would be the recovered patients.

00:33:46.203 --> 00:33:49.115
Now we don't want to have
a lot of recovered people, you know.

00:33:49.139 --> 00:33:53.064
To be clear, we're trying,
through the shutdown,

00:33:53.088 --> 00:33:54.456
in the United States,

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.692
to not get to one percent
of the population infected.

00:33:58.716 --> 00:34:00.215
We're well below that today,

00:34:00.239 --> 00:34:06.778
but with exponentiation,
you could get past that three million.

00:34:06.802 --> 00:34:10.125
I believe we will be able to avoid that

00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:13.751
with having this economic pain.

00:34:14.184 --> 00:34:15.898
Eventually, what we'll have to have

00:34:15.922 --> 00:34:18.616
is certificates of who
is a recovered person,

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:20.176
who is a vaccinated person,

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:23.643
because you don't want people
moving around the world --

00:34:23.667 --> 00:34:27.643
where you'll have some countries
that won't have it under control, sadly --

00:34:27.667 --> 00:34:30.461
you don't want to completely block off

00:34:30.485 --> 00:34:35.604
the ability for those people to go there
and come back and move around.

00:34:35.628 --> 00:34:38.866
CA: Bill, is your foundation helping
to accelerate the manufacture

00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:40.169
of these self tests?

00:34:40.193 --> 00:34:42.374
What are the prospects
for really seeing scale

00:34:42.398 --> 00:34:43.928
on some of this testing soon,

00:34:43.952 --> 00:34:46.222
not just in the US, but globally?

00:34:46.741 --> 00:34:47.964
BG: Yeah, our foundation,

00:34:47.988 --> 00:34:50.289
we'd been funding the thing
called the Flu Study

00:34:50.313 --> 00:34:53.314
to really understand
how respiratory viruses spread.

00:34:53.338 --> 00:34:58.926
It's amazing how little was understood
about how important schools are,

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:01.682
different age groups,
different types of interaction.

00:35:02.046 --> 00:35:03.815
And that gave us an experience.

00:35:03.839 --> 00:35:05.599
In fact, that flu study

00:35:05.623 --> 00:35:09.456
actually was the first time
coronavirus was found in the community,

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.338
because the government was still saying

00:35:11.362 --> 00:35:13.536
you only test people
who'd come from China,

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:17.229
but we ran into people
who had coronavirus,

00:35:17.253 --> 00:35:19.585
who hadn't been travelers.

00:35:19.609 --> 00:35:22.295
So, that was like an early warning sign,

00:35:22.319 --> 00:35:27.093
even though the regulation said
you weren't supposed to even look at that.

00:35:27.117 --> 00:35:33.749
So yeah, the Foundation is working
with all the private sector people,

00:35:33.773 --> 00:35:36.471
the diagnostics people
on this testing piece.

00:35:37.035 --> 00:35:41.309
Now that we can do the self-swab,

00:35:41.333 --> 00:35:44.118
those swabs are very easy to manufacture.

00:35:44.142 --> 00:35:46.849
The one where you had
to jam it into the throat,

00:35:46.873 --> 00:35:48.024
deep turbinate,

00:35:48.048 --> 00:35:50.864
that was getting into short supply.

00:35:50.888 --> 00:35:53.987
So the swab should not be limiting,

00:35:54.011 --> 00:35:59.543
neither should the various chemicals
that help run the PCR machines.

00:35:59.567 --> 00:36:01.488
So we should be able

00:36:01.512 --> 00:36:05.422
to get to a South Korea-type
prioritized testing thing

00:36:05.446 --> 00:36:07.077
within a few weeks.

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:11.555
CA: How important is it
that the world's nations

00:36:11.579 --> 00:36:12.926
collaborate right now?

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:15.307
I mean, it seems like, you know,

00:36:15.331 --> 00:36:18.038
here's this common enemy facing humanity,

00:36:18.062 --> 00:36:20.284
it does not know
that it just crossed a border,

00:36:20.308 --> 00:36:22.315
it does not know what race people are,

00:36:22.339 --> 00:36:23.561
what religion they are --

00:36:23.585 --> 00:36:25.096
it just knows, "Here's a human,

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:31.283
I've got a manufacturing machine here
that can make me famous."

00:36:31.307 --> 00:36:32.903
And it goes to work.

00:36:32.927 --> 00:36:35.663
It's so terrifying to me to see

00:36:35.687 --> 00:36:38.643
signs of countries starting
to blame each other

00:36:38.667 --> 00:36:43.163
or the xenophobia, it just seems so toxic.

00:36:43.187 --> 00:36:45.465
What's your take on this, Bill?

00:36:45.902 --> 00:36:48.991
Do you see signs of cooperation happening,

00:36:49.015 --> 00:36:55.238
or are you also worried about the sort of,
"US versus China" kind of thing

00:36:55.262 --> 00:36:58.061
that seems to be going on
if we're not careful?

00:36:58.085 --> 00:36:59.420
BG: Well, I see both.

00:36:59.444 --> 00:37:04.529
I see that countries that are recovered

00:37:04.553 --> 00:37:06.513
can help other countries.

00:37:07.363 --> 00:37:10.926
And that's fantastic.

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:14.509
If by the summer,
we've knocked this thing down,

00:37:14.533 --> 00:37:17.239
then great, we can help other countries.

00:37:17.263 --> 00:37:19.763
There are vaccine projects
all over the world,

00:37:19.787 --> 00:37:23.466
and those should be evaluated
on a very neutral basis,

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:27.149
to which one is the best to help humanity.

00:37:27.173 --> 00:37:31.291
And make sure the manufacturing capacity
isn't just for rich countries,

00:37:31.315 --> 00:37:35.577
that it's scaled up, very low cost stuff
for the entire world,

00:37:35.601 --> 00:37:40.684
and that's the spirit of GAVI,
is getting vaccines out to every person.

00:37:40.708 --> 00:37:45.597
So in the science side,
and data-sharing side,

00:37:45.621 --> 00:37:48.287
you see this great cooperation going on.

00:37:48.883 --> 00:37:50.855
Unfortunately, whenever you have disease,

00:37:50.879 --> 00:37:55.752
this sense of other and foreign
and "Oh, stay away from me,"

00:37:55.776 --> 00:37:59.934
you know, that sort of
pulling inward is reinforced.

00:37:59.958 --> 00:38:01.799
And we have to avoid that.

00:38:02.752 --> 00:38:06.530
You know, ironically,
we have to isolate physically,

00:38:06.554 --> 00:38:11.910
while in terms of looking
at community groups

00:38:11.934 --> 00:38:16.363
that are pooling resources
to help make sure food gets to everyone

00:38:16.387 --> 00:38:18.379
and help assure medical care,

00:38:18.403 --> 00:38:22.894
you know, if older people need
to be moved out of common facilities,

00:38:22.918 --> 00:38:24.101
you help out with that,

00:38:24.125 --> 00:38:28.951
and that people aren't suffering too much
from the psychology of isolation.

00:38:28.975 --> 00:38:32.029
So our generosity
has to go up towards others

00:38:32.053 --> 00:38:38.518
at the same time we're less actually
physically interacting with other people.

00:38:39.005 --> 00:38:43.021
CA: I mean, thinking about the situation
in many developing countries,

00:38:43.045 --> 00:38:44.854
I'm curious how you think of this.

00:38:44.878 --> 00:38:47.958
You mentioned, first of all,
that seasonality may help,

00:38:47.982 --> 00:38:49.307
i.e. high temperatures.

00:38:49.331 --> 00:38:53.608
Is it possible that that is so far
protecting, to some extent,

00:38:53.632 --> 00:38:56.783
places like India
or sub-Saharan Africa and so forth?

00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:59.720
BG: India's Northern Hemisphere.

00:38:59.744 --> 00:39:03.375
So Southern Hemisphere
is lots of Africa, South America,

00:39:03.399 --> 00:39:05.903
Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia.

00:39:05.927 --> 00:39:07.782
And it is true,

00:39:07.806 --> 00:39:11.923
either the force
of the infection is lower there

00:39:11.947 --> 00:39:14.012
or we're just not seeing it with testing.

00:39:14.036 --> 00:39:17.982
You know, a few months from now,
we'll understand the seasonality question,

00:39:18.006 --> 00:39:20.989
which would be good news
for the Northern Hemisphere,

00:39:21.013 --> 00:39:23.934
and somewhat bad news
for the Southern Hemisphere.

00:39:23.958 --> 00:39:26.299
Now more people live
in the Northern Hemisphere,

00:39:26.323 --> 00:39:29.006
including India, Pakistan,

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:31.741
and that would buy us some time,
and time is a big deal,

00:39:31.765 --> 00:39:36.808
because all these tools get so much better

00:39:36.832 --> 00:39:39.420
if you had to go into
a second season with it.

00:39:39.444 --> 00:39:40.991
But yeah, sadly,

00:39:41.015 --> 00:39:43.316
we could see, in the next few months,

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:49.741
as the Southern Hemisphere
is moving into its fall and then winter,

00:39:49.765 --> 00:39:51.392
we could see a big increase there,

00:39:51.416 --> 00:39:54.384
and that is going to be very difficult.

00:39:54.408 --> 00:39:56.719
Now they don't have as many older people,

00:39:56.743 --> 00:40:01.141
but they have lots of people
who are HIV positive,

00:40:01.165 --> 00:40:05.769
or have malnutrition
or various lung challenges

00:40:05.793 --> 00:40:06.991
because of indoor smoke,

00:40:07.015 --> 00:40:09.395
and so the wild card

00:40:09.419 --> 00:40:12.860
is how well can the developing
countries deal with this.

00:40:13.507 --> 00:40:16.615
CA: If you're in a country
where the majority of your population

00:40:16.639 --> 00:40:19.649
is making less than two
or three dollars a day,

00:40:19.673 --> 00:40:22.418
can you even afford a strategy
that looks like, basically,

00:40:22.442 --> 00:40:24.086
shutting down the economy?

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:31.110
BG: I'm very worried that there will be
a massive number of deaths

00:40:31.134 --> 00:40:32.658
in those poorer countries,

00:40:32.682 --> 00:40:35.912
because the health systems just aren't --

00:40:35.936 --> 00:40:38.752
you know, the number
of respirators, hospitals,

00:40:38.776 --> 00:40:40.887
and of course,
when you overload that system,

00:40:40.911 --> 00:40:43.299
your deaths are not just COVID deaths,

00:40:43.323 --> 00:40:48.333
but everyone else who's trying to access
a system that will be somewhat in chaos,

00:40:48.357 --> 00:40:51.378
including with health workers
who are getting sick.

00:40:52.438 --> 00:40:55.272
CA: OK, we're getting near
to running out of time with this.

00:40:55.296 --> 00:40:58.374
Whitney, maybe a last question
or two from online.

00:40:58.398 --> 00:41:00.073
WPR: Sure, we have two from online,

00:41:00.097 --> 00:41:02.958
we're seeing thousands of questions
around these same lines.

00:41:02.982 --> 00:41:05.855
One, there's lots of people
who are really interested to hear

00:41:05.879 --> 00:41:08.768
about the kind of work that you're doing
with your foundation

00:41:08.792 --> 00:41:12.294
as far as distributing tests,
but also producing safety gear,

00:41:12.318 --> 00:41:14.023
masks and that sort of thing,

00:41:14.047 --> 00:41:16.430
to help with this effort
for health workers.

00:41:17.087 --> 00:41:19.436
BG: So the Gates Foundation,

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:22.905
you know, we, very early on,

00:41:22.929 --> 00:41:26.950
gave out 100 million
to help out with all the pieces:

00:41:26.974 --> 00:41:30.918
the testing piece,
the therapeutics and the vaccines.

00:41:30.942 --> 00:41:35.304
We are not experts in making masks
and ventilators and gowns,

00:41:35.328 --> 00:41:39.685
and it's great that other people,
including some 3D printing,

00:41:39.709 --> 00:41:42.351
and open-source things, that is great.

00:41:42.375 --> 00:41:47.237
Our focus, you know,
like this self-swab thing,

00:41:47.261 --> 00:41:48.975
nobody had done that before,

00:41:48.999 --> 00:41:50.864
people thought it wouldn't work,

00:41:50.888 --> 00:41:52.460
we were quite sure it would work.

00:41:52.484 --> 00:41:55.499
And so that, for the globe,
is a huge thing.

00:41:55.523 --> 00:41:58.101
We work a lot with both
governments and private sector,

00:41:58.125 --> 00:42:01.006
so in some ways, we're kind of a bridge.

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:04.284
And we've been talking to the heads
of the pharmaceutical companies,

00:42:04.308 --> 00:42:05.895
the testing companies

00:42:05.919 --> 00:42:08.315
and, specifically,
with the ones doing vaccines,

00:42:08.339 --> 00:42:12.639
including some of which are these new
type of vaccines, RNA vaccines,

00:42:12.663 --> 00:42:16.315
that we've been backing
for quite some time,

00:42:16.339 --> 00:42:17.720
and CEPI has been backing.

00:42:17.744 --> 00:42:21.723
And so our expertise
is in those medical tools

00:42:21.747 --> 00:42:25.744
and really getting the best
of the private sector engaged there.

00:42:25.768 --> 00:42:26.942
It's been a little slow.

00:42:26.966 --> 00:42:29.340
We can write checks right away,

00:42:29.364 --> 00:42:30.954
whereas the government processes,

00:42:30.978 --> 00:42:33.347
even in this situation --

00:42:33.371 --> 00:42:35.585
you know, there's still
this notion of bidding,

00:42:35.609 --> 00:42:40.073
and not really knowing who has
the unique capabilities of doing things,

00:42:40.097 --> 00:42:44.470
and so, an organization
that's working on this all the time,

00:42:44.494 --> 00:42:46.145
lots of new vaccines,

00:42:46.169 --> 00:42:48.403
can step in and be helpful.

00:42:48.427 --> 00:42:49.720
And it's really amazing.

00:42:49.744 --> 00:42:51.760
When we talk to private-sector partners,

00:42:51.784 --> 00:42:58.415
their interest in helping out
has been absolutely fantastic.

00:42:58.439 --> 00:43:02.257
And so that's where we have a unique role.

00:43:02.281 --> 00:43:05.010
WPR: And the other question
that we're seeing a ton of --

00:43:05.034 --> 00:43:06.630
before we wrap up here --

00:43:06.654 --> 00:43:09.691
is just people are really interested
in your insight, Bill,

00:43:09.715 --> 00:43:12.492
on whether you think we are heading
in the right direction,

00:43:12.516 --> 00:43:15.326
do you feel like our economy
is heading in the right place,

00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:17.429
that humanity is heading
in the right place,

00:43:17.453 --> 00:43:19.093
are we in a better position now

00:43:19.117 --> 00:43:21.442
than you thought we were in
five years ago?

00:43:22.911 --> 00:43:24.360
BG: Well, five years ago,

00:43:24.384 --> 00:43:28.100
I said that pandemic

00:43:28.124 --> 00:43:33.394
is this unaddressed,
very, very scary thing.

00:43:33.823 --> 00:43:38.879
And that if we did the right things,
we could be more prepared.

00:43:38.903 --> 00:43:40.641
Science is on our side.

00:43:40.665 --> 00:43:46.502
The fact we can be ready
for the next epidemic,

00:43:46.526 --> 00:43:49.319
it's very clear how to do that.

00:43:49.343 --> 00:43:51.397
And yes, it will take tens of billions,

00:43:51.421 --> 00:43:54.622
but not hundreds or trillions of dollars.

00:43:54.646 --> 00:43:58.688
So it will be tiny compared
to the economic cost.

00:43:58.712 --> 00:44:00.992
I remember when I did
that presentation 2015,

00:44:01.016 --> 00:44:05.359
I put up, "Hey, a big flu epidemic
could cost four trillion,"

00:44:05.383 --> 00:44:07.312
and I thought, wow, that's a big number,

00:44:07.336 --> 00:44:09.232
do I really think it's that big?

00:44:09.256 --> 00:44:12.553
And I went and looked up numbers
and thought, yeah, well, that's big.

00:44:12.577 --> 00:44:18.577
This epidemic will cost
that much to the economy.

00:44:18.601 --> 00:44:21.363
So in the short run,

00:44:21.387 --> 00:44:24.755
we are going to have more pain
and more difficulty

00:44:24.779 --> 00:44:28.130
and people are going to have to step up
to help each other.

00:44:28.154 --> 00:44:30.353
I'm still very much an optimist, you know,

00:44:30.377 --> 00:44:33.844
whether it's climate change,
countries working together,

00:44:33.868 --> 00:44:39.546
biology taking the diseases, malaria, TB,

00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:43.042
you know, even advances
for what are more rich-world diseases,

00:44:43.066 --> 00:44:44.221
like cancer.

00:44:44.245 --> 00:44:45.522
The amount of innovation,

00:44:45.546 --> 00:44:47.958
the way we can connect up
and work together --

00:44:47.982 --> 00:44:51.371
yes, I'm superpositive about that.

00:44:51.395 --> 00:44:52.710
You know, I love my work

00:44:52.734 --> 00:44:56.451
because I see progress
on all these diseases all the time.

00:44:56.475 --> 00:45:01.110
Now we have to turn
and focus on this, you know.

00:45:01.134 --> 00:45:02.744
Sadly, it may interrupt

00:45:02.768 --> 00:45:05.474
and the polio situation
might get worse a little bit

00:45:05.498 --> 00:45:08.403
because of the distraction here.

00:45:08.427 --> 00:45:10.720
We're using a lot of the great capacity

00:45:10.744 --> 00:45:13.776
that was built up
for those polio activities

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:17.196
to try and help the developing countries
respond to this very well.

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:18.894
And that is appropriate,

00:45:18.918 --> 00:45:20.972
but the message from me,

00:45:20.996 --> 00:45:25.884
although it's very sober
when we're dealing with this epidemic,

00:45:25.908 --> 00:45:31.791
you know, I'm very positive
that this should draw us together.

00:45:31.815 --> 00:45:35.259
We will get out of this,

00:45:35.283 --> 00:45:39.987
and then, we will get ready
for the next epidemic.

00:45:40.887 --> 00:45:43.442
CA: That's exactly
what I was going to ask you, Bill,

00:45:43.466 --> 00:45:48.236
which is, where is your head,
do you think we will get through this?

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:52.106
Will the leaders that matter
listen to the scientists,

00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:53.281
will they?

00:45:53.305 --> 00:45:54.553
Will we make it through?

00:45:54.577 --> 00:45:56.752
Do you believe that within
a few months' time,

00:45:56.776 --> 00:45:59.125
we're already going to be
looking back and saying,

00:45:59.149 --> 00:46:01.482
"Phew, we dodged a pretty bad one there."

00:46:01.506 --> 00:46:04.363
BG: We can't say for sure

00:46:04.387 --> 00:46:07.029
that even the rich countries
will be out of this

00:46:07.053 --> 00:46:08.783
in six to ten weeks.

00:46:08.807 --> 00:46:10.387
I think that's likely,

00:46:10.411 --> 00:46:12.791
but as we get the testing data,

00:46:12.815 --> 00:46:14.553
we'll get more of a sense of that

00:46:14.577 --> 00:46:17.260
and people will continuously
be able to see that.

00:46:17.737 --> 00:46:21.420
But you know, the rich countries
will get out of this.

00:46:21.444 --> 00:46:24.348
The developing countries
will bear a significant price,

00:46:24.372 --> 00:46:27.149
but even they, we will get a vaccine

00:46:27.173 --> 00:46:31.087
and GAVI will get that out to everyone.

00:46:31.111 --> 00:46:34.496
So you know, two to three years from now,

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:37.275
this thing, even on a global basis,

00:46:37.299 --> 00:46:41.737
will essentially be over
with a gigantic price tag.

00:46:42.157 --> 00:46:44.117
But now we're going to know,

00:46:44.141 --> 00:46:46.918
OK, next time we see a pathogen,

00:46:46.942 --> 00:46:51.506
we can make billions of tests
within two or three weeks.

00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:54.764
We can figure out
which antiviral drugs work

00:46:54.788 --> 00:46:56.064
within two or three weeks

00:46:56.088 --> 00:46:57.242
and get those scaled up.

00:46:57.266 --> 00:46:58.847
And we can make a vaccine,

00:46:58.871 --> 00:47:00.331
if we're really ready,

00:47:00.355 --> 00:47:02.823
probably in six months,

00:47:02.847 --> 00:47:06.189
using these new platforms,
probably the RNA vaccine.

00:47:06.213 --> 00:47:13.086
So specifically, there are innovations
that are there

00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:19.577
that will get financed,
you know, I hope, quite generously,

00:47:19.601 --> 00:47:21.139
coming out of this thing.

00:47:21.163 --> 00:47:23.919
And so, three years from now,
we'll look back and say,

00:47:23.943 --> 00:47:26.125
you know, that was awful,

00:47:26.149 --> 00:47:28.645
there's a lot of heroes,
but we've learned a lesson

00:47:28.669 --> 00:47:32.498
and the world as a whole,

00:47:32.522 --> 00:47:35.189
with its great science
and desire to help each other,

00:47:35.213 --> 00:47:38.466
was able to try and minimize
what happened there

00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:42.578
and avoid it happening again.

00:47:43.365 --> 00:47:45.569
CA: That's certainly
the optimistic scenario

00:47:45.593 --> 00:47:48.043
that I'm craving for, myself.

00:47:48.067 --> 00:47:51.049
That the world kind of realizes,

00:47:51.073 --> 00:47:54.188
one, that there are certain things
that you just have to unite on.

00:47:54.212 --> 00:47:55.918
Two, that science really matters

00:47:55.942 --> 00:47:59.965
and it's a miracle that science
can understand this bug,

00:47:59.989 --> 00:48:01.903
you know, make a vaccine,

00:48:01.927 --> 00:48:03.887
sequence it, make therapeutics,

00:48:03.911 --> 00:48:05.689
understand how to model it --

00:48:05.713 --> 00:48:07.204
it's kind of miraculous to me.

00:48:07.228 --> 00:48:10.752
So will we learn, now,
to pay attention to scientists,

00:48:10.776 --> 00:48:13.951
because if we do,
I'm sure that you feel this as well,

00:48:13.975 --> 00:48:15.959
there's an amazing analogue with climate,

00:48:15.983 --> 00:48:17.633
it's just a different timescale.

00:48:17.657 --> 00:48:19.672
That the scientists are out there, saying,

00:48:19.696 --> 00:48:21.229
"There's this huge enemy coming,

00:48:21.253 --> 00:48:22.434
if we do nothing,

00:48:22.458 --> 00:48:25.760
it's going to take millions of lives,
it's going to wreck our planet.

00:48:25.784 --> 00:48:27.395
For God's sake, act, politicians!

00:48:27.419 --> 00:48:28.577
Do something."

00:48:28.601 --> 00:48:30.522
And the politicians are going, "Meh, no.

00:48:30.546 --> 00:48:33.141
We need a little more GDP,
we need to win an election."

00:48:33.165 --> 00:48:34.379
And they're not acting.

00:48:34.403 --> 00:48:37.756
Do you see a scenario
where this shocks politicians

00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:39.385
to actually change their thinking

00:48:39.409 --> 00:48:41.504
and their prioritization
of science overall,

00:48:41.528 --> 00:48:43.669
or is that asking too much?

00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:47.864
BG: Yeah, it's interesting
how much of this distraction

00:48:47.888 --> 00:48:54.783
will delay the urgent innovation agenda
that exists over in climate.

00:48:54.807 --> 00:48:58.688
You know, I have freed up
a lot of time to work on climate.

00:48:58.712 --> 00:48:59.918
I have to say,

00:48:59.942 --> 00:49:02.808
you know, for the last few months,
that's now shifted,

00:49:02.832 --> 00:49:07.737
and until we get out of this crisis,
COVID will dominate,

00:49:07.761 --> 00:49:12.348
and so some of the climate stuff,
although it will still go on,

00:49:12.372 --> 00:49:15.196
it won't get that same focus.

00:49:15.704 --> 00:49:19.285
As we get past this,

00:49:19.309 --> 00:49:23.884
yes, that idea of innovation and science
and the world working together,

00:49:23.908 --> 00:49:27.450
that is totally common
between these two problems.

00:49:27.474 --> 00:49:32.209
And so I don't think this has to be
a huge setback for climate.

00:49:32.609 --> 00:49:33.810
CA: Last question.

00:49:33.834 --> 00:49:36.276
There are thousands of people watching,

00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:38.688
many of them living alone,

00:49:38.712 --> 00:49:40.304
some quite scared,

00:49:40.328 --> 00:49:43.704
there may even be people there
who have this virus

00:49:43.728 --> 00:49:47.056
and are suffering symptoms or recovering.

00:49:47.442 --> 00:49:51.053
By the way, if that's you,
we'd love to hear from you,

00:49:51.077 --> 00:49:52.240
we really would.

00:49:52.264 --> 00:49:54.275
Maybe have a conversation
with some of you,

00:49:54.299 --> 00:49:56.347
in a future one of these,

00:49:56.371 --> 00:49:59.045
just understanding the experience.

00:49:59.069 --> 00:50:03.848
But Bill, what can people do
as individuals from their own homes,

00:50:03.872 --> 00:50:06.390
right now, to try and help?

00:50:07.331 --> 00:50:09.675
BG: Well, there's a lot
of creativity, you know --

00:50:09.699 --> 00:50:14.856
can you mentor kids who are being forced
into an online format

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:17.661
where the school systems
really weren't ready for that?

00:50:17.685 --> 00:50:22.840
Can you organize some giving activity
that gets the food banks to step up

00:50:22.864 --> 00:50:25.649
where there's problems there?

00:50:25.673 --> 00:50:27.768
These are such unprecedented times,

00:50:27.792 --> 00:50:33.427
and it really should draw out
that sense of creativity,

00:50:33.451 --> 00:50:37.323
while complying
with the isolation mandates.

00:50:38.569 --> 00:50:41.744
CA: Bill, I really want to thank you
for spending this time with us

00:50:41.768 --> 00:50:45.400
and for the financial investment,
the time investment.

00:50:45.424 --> 00:50:49.995
You've really invested your life
into trying to solve these big problems.

00:50:50.019 --> 00:50:52.019
And this is as big as they get.

00:50:52.043 --> 00:50:55.630
I have a hunch that your voice
is really going to be needed

00:50:55.654 --> 00:50:56.831
in the next few weeks.

00:50:56.855 --> 00:50:58.720
Thank you so much for your time today.

00:50:58.744 --> 00:51:00.815
This was really wonderful,
hearing from you.

00:51:00.839 --> 00:51:01.990
Thank you.

00:51:02.014 --> 00:51:03.215
BG: Thanks, Chris.

00:51:03.239 --> 00:51:05.094
CA: OK, thanks, everyone,

00:51:05.118 --> 00:51:07.692
thanks for being part
of the TED community.

00:51:07.716 --> 00:51:10.268
Look after yourselves,
be smart about this.

00:51:10.292 --> 00:51:11.682
You know, get ahead of it.

00:51:11.706 --> 00:51:15.077
If you're in a part of the world
where this thing hasn't really hit,

00:51:15.101 --> 00:51:17.228
listen to Bill Gates.

00:51:17.252 --> 00:51:18.403
Get ahead of it.

00:51:18.427 --> 00:51:22.204
Keep, you know, if you possibly can,

00:51:22.228 --> 00:51:23.379
socially distanced.

00:51:23.403 --> 00:51:26.133
No, not -- physically distanced
and socially connect.

00:51:26.157 --> 00:51:28.291
That's what the internet is for.

00:51:28.315 --> 00:51:31.494
These days are what
the internet was built for.

00:51:31.804 --> 00:51:33.717
We can spread love, we can spread ideas,

00:51:33.741 --> 00:51:36.081
we can spread relationship,
we can spread thought,

00:51:36.105 --> 00:51:39.121
without spreading a dangerous bug.

00:51:39.145 --> 00:51:42.035
So get ahead of it,
and let's figure this out together.

00:51:42.059 --> 00:51:44.619
It's been wonderful
spending time with you.

00:51:44.643 --> 00:51:47.865
From Whitney and from me
and from the whole TED team,

00:51:47.889 --> 00:51:49.304
thank you, and over and out.
