00:00:13.142 --> 00:00:18.596
NASA's always on the lookout
for possible asteroid collision hazards,

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.700
so the Pan-STARRS telescope
is scanning the sky every night.

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:27.351
Each morning, candidate objects
are examined by Pan-STARRS staff

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:30.602
and usually discovered to be no big deal.

00:00:30.626 --> 00:00:33.365
But on October 19, 2017,

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:38.041
Pan-STARRS spotted an object
moving rapidly between the stars,

00:00:38.065 --> 00:00:42.383
and this time the usual follow-up
measurements of position and speed

00:00:42.407 --> 00:00:45.222
showed something completely different.

00:00:45.246 --> 00:00:47.751
By October 22nd, we had enough data

00:00:47.775 --> 00:00:51.945
to realize that this object
wasn't from our solar system.

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:53.310
Holy cow.

00:00:53.334 --> 00:00:55.081
That's when I got the phone call,

00:00:55.105 --> 00:00:59.111
the phone call that all solar system
astronomers are waiting for.

00:00:59.135 --> 00:01:01.246
Let me tell you how exciting this was.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.277
(Laughter)

00:01:02.301 --> 00:01:05.422
NASA's been expecting to see
an interstellar comet

00:01:05.446 --> 00:01:08.786
pass through the solar system
since the 1970s,

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.668
but until now, we'd never seen anything.

00:01:11.692 --> 00:01:14.318
Our own solar system is huge,

00:01:14.342 --> 00:01:17.651
so even getting a package
from the nearest star system

00:01:17.675 --> 00:01:19.778
4.4 light years away

00:01:19.802 --> 00:01:22.384
would take over 50,000 years.

00:01:22.408 --> 00:01:24.453
So this is a really big deal.

00:01:24.945 --> 00:01:27.447
The interstellar visitor
entered our solar system

00:01:27.471 --> 00:01:29.321
from above the plane of the planets,

00:01:29.345 --> 00:01:32.178
coming from the direction
of the constellation Lyra,

00:01:32.202 --> 00:01:35.638
and it passed closest to the Sun
on September 9th,

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:38.067
passing inside the orbit of Mercury.

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:42.738
Now this isn't a particularly
close approach or unusual distance.

00:01:42.762 --> 00:01:46.471
It's just much easier
to see objects close by.

00:01:47.124 --> 00:01:48.800
On October 14th,

00:01:48.824 --> 00:01:52.926
before we discovered it, it made
its closest approach to the Earth,

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.640
within about 15 million miles.

00:01:55.664 --> 00:01:58.421
This is really close
by astronomical standards.

00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:03.817
Now rather than call this
by its unwieldy catalog name,

00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:06.484
we briefly called it "Rama,"

00:02:06.508 --> 00:02:10.016
after the cylindrical spacecraft
that passed through the solar system

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.254
in Arthur C. Clarke's classic
science fiction story in 1973.

00:02:15.865 --> 00:02:17.942
But this wasn't quite right either,

00:02:17.966 --> 00:02:21.199
so in honor of it being discovered
by a telescope in Hawaii,

00:02:21.223 --> 00:02:24.620
we consulted two experts
on Hawaiian culture --

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:27.097
a Hawaiian navigator and a linguist --

00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:28.863
to propose a name.

00:02:28.887 --> 00:02:31.871
And they suggested "'Oumuamua,"

00:02:31.895 --> 00:02:36.950
which means scout or messenger
from the distant past reaching out to us.

00:02:37.972 --> 00:02:41.338
Now this discovery
was important for many reasons,

00:02:41.362 --> 00:02:45.198
but to me the most significant
is for what 'Oumuamua can tell us

00:02:45.222 --> 00:02:47.639
about the past of our solar system.

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:52.410
The process of the birth of a new solar
system and the growth of planets

00:02:52.434 --> 00:02:55.516
can be a violent and messy business.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.763
Leftover icy and rocky debris
gets ejected from the new solar system

00:02:59.787 --> 00:03:03.136
as the giant planets migrate
through the dusty disk

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.088
out of which they're formed.

00:03:06.175 --> 00:03:10.155
Now have you ever felt an emotional chill,

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:14.980
something that's so exciting
that a shiver runs up and down your spine?

00:03:16.115 --> 00:03:19.051
Or something that's
very emotionally moving?

00:03:19.678 --> 00:03:21.425
Well this was it for me.

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.274
This was my wow moment.

00:03:23.298 --> 00:03:27.186
We actually had a piece of material
from another solar system

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.869
coming close enough for us to observe.

00:03:31.793 --> 00:03:34.651
So what would you like to know
about 'Oumuamua,

00:03:34.675 --> 00:03:37.706
the very first visitor
from another star system?

00:03:38.454 --> 00:03:41.242
Well, I could think of a million things,

00:03:41.266 --> 00:03:44.846
but there's what you want
and what you can have,

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.204
and 'Oumuamua was moving away
and fading very rapidly.

00:03:49.228 --> 00:03:51.429
In the span of about a week,

00:03:51.453 --> 00:03:54.124
it had dropped in brightness
by a factor of [10].

00:03:54.852 --> 00:03:57.268
So this is about all the time
we were going to have

00:03:57.292 --> 00:03:59.179
to study it easily.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.612
So we had to distill the process
of getting telescope time --

00:04:04.636 --> 00:04:08.176
normally a very competitive,
peer-reviewed proposal process

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.048
that can take up to months --

00:04:10.072 --> 00:04:12.771
down to less than a few days.

00:04:12.795 --> 00:04:16.540
So began a "polite"
competition for resources.

00:04:17.408 --> 00:04:20.202
OK, let me not mince words.
It was a fierce battle.

00:04:20.226 --> 00:04:21.994
We dropped everything,

00:04:22.018 --> 00:04:23.464
working around the clock,

00:04:23.488 --> 00:04:27.369
trying to craft
perfectly crafted proposal words

00:04:27.393 --> 00:04:29.638
to send to the observatory directors.

00:04:30.527 --> 00:04:33.375
Well, good news. We got the time.

00:04:34.178 --> 00:04:37.741
Now, from a perfectly
selfish point of view,

00:04:37.765 --> 00:04:42.131
the first thing we might like to know
is how massive 'Oumuamua is.

00:04:42.155 --> 00:04:44.995
Because after all,
it passed very close to the Earth,

00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:48.034
and we didn't know about it
until afterwards.

00:04:48.757 --> 00:04:53.058
How bad would this have been
had it not missed the Earth?

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.752
Well, the impact energy

00:04:55.776 --> 00:04:59.385
depends on the square
of the velocity times its mass,

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:03.005
and the mass depends
on how big it is and what it's made of.

00:05:03.647 --> 00:05:07.068
So how big is 'Oumuamua,
and what's its shape?

00:05:07.765 --> 00:05:10.085
Well, we can get this from its brightness.

00:05:10.109 --> 00:05:13.076
Now, if you don't believe me,
think of comparing the brightness

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.482
of a firefly in your backyard

00:05:14.506 --> 00:05:18.926
to the navigation lights
on a distant airplane.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.922
You know the airplane is much brighter --

00:05:20.946 --> 00:05:23.646
it just appears faint
because it's so far away.

00:05:24.775 --> 00:05:26.609
We're also going to need to know

00:05:26.633 --> 00:05:29.783
how reflective
the surface of 'Oumuamua is,

00:05:29.807 --> 00:05:31.917
and we don't have any clue,

00:05:31.941 --> 00:05:35.801
but it's reasonable to assume
it's very similar to small asteroids

00:05:35.825 --> 00:05:37.807
and comets in our solar system,

00:05:37.831 --> 00:05:39.181
or in technical terms,

00:05:39.205 --> 00:05:43.418
something between the reflectivity
of charcoal and wet sand.

00:05:44.381 --> 00:05:50.096
Nowadays, most of the big telescopes
are used in what's called a service mode,

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.976
meaning we have to carefully develop
all the instructions

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.549
and send them to the telescope operator,

00:05:56.573 --> 00:05:59.502
and then anxiously wait
for the data to come back,

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:01.749
praying to the weather gods.

00:06:01.773 --> 00:06:04.074
Now I bet most of you don't have careers

00:06:04.098 --> 00:06:08.909
that critically depend on whether or not
it's cloudy last night.

00:06:08.933 --> 00:06:12.100
Well, we weren't going to get
any second chances here.

00:06:12.124 --> 00:06:16.232
Because the weather was great,
'Oumuamua decided not to be.

00:06:16.256 --> 00:06:18.256
Its brightness wasn't constant.

00:06:18.732 --> 00:06:21.947
Now here we see 'Oumuamua
racing between the stars.

00:06:21.971 --> 00:06:23.550
It's centered in the middle.

00:06:23.574 --> 00:06:27.494
The stars are trailed out because
the telescope is following its motion.

00:06:28.145 --> 00:06:33.597
It started faint and then it got brighter,
fainter, brighter, and fainter again,

00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:38.446
as sunlight is reflected off
of four sides of an oblong object.

00:06:39.302 --> 00:06:41.732
The extreme brightness change

00:06:41.756 --> 00:06:46.061
led us to an unbelievable
conclusion about its shape.

00:06:46.085 --> 00:06:48.078
As shown in this artist's impression,

00:06:48.102 --> 00:06:51.633
'Oumuamua is apparently
very long and narrow,

00:06:51.657 --> 00:06:54.760
with an axis ratio of about 10 to one.

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:59.392
Assuming it's dark,
this means it's about half a mile long.

00:06:59.987 --> 00:07:03.535
Nothing else in our
solar system looks like this.

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:06.997
We only have a handful of objects
that even have an axis ratio

00:07:07.021 --> 00:07:08.735
bigger than five to one.

00:07:09.286 --> 00:07:11.265
So we don't know how this forms,

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:16.487
but it may be part of its birth process
in its home solar system.

00:07:17.549 --> 00:07:23.018
'Oumuamua was varying in brightness
every 7.34 hours,

00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:24.788
or so we thought.

00:07:24.812 --> 00:07:27.154
As more data started
to come in from other teams,

00:07:27.178 --> 00:07:29.636
they were reporting different numbers.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.586
Why is it the more
we learn about something,

00:07:31.606 --> 00:07:33.546
the harder it gets to interpret?

00:07:34.596 --> 00:07:37.985
Well, it turns out that 'Oumuamua
is not rotating in a simple way.

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:40.068
It's wobbling like a top.

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:43.178
So while it is rotating
around its short axis,

00:07:43.202 --> 00:07:46.052
it's also rolling around the long axis

00:07:46.076 --> 00:07:48.146
and nodding up and down.

00:07:48.887 --> 00:07:51.713
This very energetic, excited motion

00:07:51.737 --> 00:07:55.197
is almost certainly the result
of it being violently tossed

00:07:55.221 --> 00:07:57.143
out of its home solar system.

00:07:58.363 --> 00:08:01.154
Now how we interpret the shape
from its brightness

00:08:01.178 --> 00:08:04.050
depends very critically
on how it's spinning,

00:08:04.074 --> 00:08:07.044
so now we have to rethink
what it may look like,

00:08:07.068 --> 00:08:10.513
and as shown in this beautiful painting
by space artist Bill Hartmann,

00:08:10.537 --> 00:08:14.496
we think that 'Oumuamua
may be more of a flattened oval.

00:08:15.822 --> 00:08:17.784
So let's get back to the energetics.

00:08:17.808 --> 00:08:19.719
What is it made of?

00:08:19.743 --> 00:08:22.967
Well, ideally we would love
to have a piece of 'Oumuamua

00:08:22.991 --> 00:08:26.189
into the laboratory,
so we could study it in detail.

00:08:26.213 --> 00:08:29.880
But since even private industry
can't manage to launch

00:08:29.904 --> 00:08:31.666
a spacecraft within a week

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:33.357
to something like this,

00:08:33.381 --> 00:08:36.542
astronomers have to rely
on remote observations.

00:08:36.566 --> 00:08:40.511
So astronomers will look at how the light
interacts with the surface.

00:08:40.535 --> 00:08:44.701
Some colors may get absorbed,
giving it a chemical fingerprint,

00:08:44.725 --> 00:08:46.972
whereas other colors may not.

00:08:46.996 --> 00:08:51.249
On the other hand, some substances
may just reflect more blue

00:08:51.273 --> 00:08:53.091
or red light efficiently.

00:08:53.659 --> 00:08:57.382
In the case of 'Oumuamua,
it reflected more red light,

00:08:57.406 --> 00:09:02.429
making it look very much like the organic
rich surface of the comet recently visited

00:09:02.453 --> 00:09:04.239
by the Rosetta spacecraft.

00:09:04.887 --> 00:09:09.618
But not everything that looks reddish
has the same composition.

00:09:09.642 --> 00:09:13.118
In fact, minerals that have
tiny little bits of iron in the surface

00:09:13.142 --> 00:09:15.079
can also look red,

00:09:15.103 --> 00:09:17.953
as does the dark side
of Saturn's moon Iapetus,

00:09:17.977 --> 00:09:20.762
shown in these images
from the Cassini spacecraft.

00:09:21.432 --> 00:09:23.623
Nickel-iron meteorites,
in other words, metal,

00:09:23.647 --> 00:09:25.376
can also look red.

00:09:26.032 --> 00:09:28.702
So while we don't know
what's on the surface,

00:09:28.726 --> 00:09:31.872
we know even less
about what's on the inside.

00:09:32.435 --> 00:09:35.523
However, we do know
that it must at least be strong enough

00:09:35.547 --> 00:09:37.919
to not fly apart as it rotates,

00:09:37.943 --> 00:09:41.903
so it probably has a density
similar to that of rocky asteroids;

00:09:41.927 --> 00:09:44.419
perhaps even denser, like metal.

00:09:45.305 --> 00:09:47.376
Well, at the very least,
I want to show you

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.542
one of the beautiful
color images that we got

00:09:49.566 --> 00:09:51.706
from one of the ground-based telescopes.

00:09:52.145 --> 00:09:55.144
All right, I admit,
it's not all that spectacular.

00:09:55.168 --> 00:09:56.180
(Laughter)

00:09:56.204 --> 00:09:59.163
We just don't have the resolution.

00:09:59.187 --> 00:10:01.116
Even Hubble Space Telescope

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.189
doesn't present a much better view.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.633
But the importance of the Hubble data
was not because of the images,

00:10:07.657 --> 00:10:10.149
but because it extended
our observations out

00:10:10.173 --> 00:10:12.856
to two and a half months
from the discovery,

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.584
meaning we get more positions
along the orbit,

00:10:15.608 --> 00:10:20.084
which will hopefully let us figure out
where 'Oumuamua came from.

00:10:21.667 --> 00:10:24.420
So what exactly is 'Oumuamua?

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:30.673
We firmly believe it's likely to be
a leftover archaeological remnant

00:10:30.697 --> 00:10:34.285
from the process of the birth
of another planetary system,

00:10:34.309 --> 00:10:36.157
some celestial driftwood.

00:10:36.593 --> 00:10:39.976
Some scientists think
that maybe 'Oumuamua formed

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.595
very close to a star
that was much denser than our own,

00:10:43.619 --> 00:10:47.032
and the star's tidal forces
shredded planetary material

00:10:47.056 --> 00:10:48.906
early in the solar system's history.

00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:53.526
Still others suggest that maybe
this is something that formed

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.716
during the death throes of a star,

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.532
perhaps during a supernova explosion,

00:10:58.556 --> 00:11:01.168
as planetary material got shredded.

00:11:02.345 --> 00:11:05.853
Whatever it is, we believe
it's a natural object,

00:11:05.877 --> 00:11:10.138
but we can't actually prove
that it's not something artificial.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:14.067
The color, the strange shape,
the tumbling motion

00:11:14.091 --> 00:11:16.202
could all have other explanations.

00:11:16.825 --> 00:11:20.445
Now while we don't believe
this is alien technology,

00:11:20.469 --> 00:11:25.111
why not do the obvious experiment
and search for a radio signal?

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.580
That's exactly what
the Breakthrough Listen project did,

00:11:28.604 --> 00:11:32.306
but so far, 'Oumuamua
has remained completely quiet.

00:11:33.091 --> 00:11:35.870
Now could we send
a spacecraft to 'Oumuamua

00:11:35.894 --> 00:11:38.238
and answer this question once and for all?

00:11:38.262 --> 00:11:40.513
Yes, we do actually have the technology,

00:11:40.537 --> 00:11:42.926
but it would be a long
and expensive voyage,

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.228
and we would get there so far from the Sun

00:11:45.252 --> 00:11:48.545
that the final approach trajectory
would be very difficult.

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:54.861
So I think 'Oumuamua probably
has many more things to teach us,

00:11:54.885 --> 00:11:57.298
and in fact there might be
more surprises in store

00:11:57.322 --> 00:12:01.377
as scientists such as myself
continue to work with the data.

00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:05.669
More importantly,
I think this visitor from afar

00:12:05.693 --> 00:12:10.455
has really brought home the point
that our solar system isn't isolated.

00:12:10.852 --> 00:12:13.266
We're part of a much larger environment,

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:18.154
and in fact, we may even
be surrounded by interstellar visitors

00:12:18.178 --> 00:12:20.211
and not even know it.

00:12:20.235 --> 00:12:22.347
This unexpected gift

00:12:22.371 --> 00:12:26.958
has perhaps raised more questions
than its provided answers,

00:12:26.982 --> 00:12:32.307
but we were the first to say hello
to a visitor from another solar system.

00:12:32.712 --> 00:12:33.894
Thank you.

00:12:33.918 --> 00:12:40.902
(Applause)

00:12:42.946 --> 00:12:44.401
Jedidah Isler: Thanks, Karen.

00:12:44.425 --> 00:12:46.807
I of course enjoyed
that talk very much. Thank you.

00:12:46.831 --> 00:12:50.384
As I recall, we found it
pretty late in its journey towards us.

00:12:50.408 --> 00:12:54.020
Will future technologies like
the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope

00:12:54.044 --> 00:12:55.757
help us detect these things sooner?

00:12:56.353 --> 00:13:00.098
Karen Meech: Yeah. We're hoping that
we'll start to see a lot of these things,

00:13:00.122 --> 00:13:03.941
and ideally, you'd love to find one
as it's approaching the Sun,

00:13:03.965 --> 00:13:06.981
because you want to have time
to do all the science,

00:13:07.005 --> 00:13:08.202
or even more ideal,

00:13:08.226 --> 00:13:10.291
you'd get a spacecraft ready to go,

00:13:10.315 --> 00:13:13.465
parked somewhere in the L4 or L5 position,

00:13:13.489 --> 00:13:14.823
somewhere near Earth,

00:13:14.847 --> 00:13:17.838
so that when something comes by,
you can chase it.

00:13:17.862 --> 00:13:20.411
JI: Awesome, thanks so much.
Let's thank Karen again.

00:13:20.435 --> 00:13:23.099
(Applause)
