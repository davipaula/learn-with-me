00:00:12.916 --> 00:00:15.262
The Philippines: an idyllic country

00:00:15.286 --> 00:00:19.039
with some of the clearest water
and bluest skies on the planet.

00:00:19.063 --> 00:00:20.655
It is also the epicenter

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:24.080
of one of the fastest-growing
HIV epidemics in the world.

00:00:24.494 --> 00:00:28.302
On the surface, it seems
as if we are just a late bloomer.

00:00:28.326 --> 00:00:31.169
However, the reasons
for our current epidemic

00:00:31.193 --> 00:00:33.017
are much more complicated

00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:36.962
and may foreshadow
a global resurgence of HIV.

00:00:38.128 --> 00:00:42.609
While overall new cases of HIV
continue to drop in the world,

00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:45.093
this trend may be short-lived

00:00:45.117 --> 00:00:49.002
when the next wave of more aggressive
and resistant viruses arrive.

00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:55.423
HIV has a potential to transform itself
into a new and different virus

00:00:55.447 --> 00:00:57.002
every time it infects a cell.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.763
Despite the remarkable progress
we've made in reversing the epidemic,

00:01:01.787 --> 00:01:06.601
the truth is that we are just a few
viral mutations away from disaster.

00:01:07.125 --> 00:01:11.104
To appreciate the profound way
in which HIV transforms itself

00:01:11.128 --> 00:01:12.801
every time it reproduces,

00:01:12.825 --> 00:01:14.573
let's make a genetic comparison.

00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:18.756
If we look at the DNA variation
among humans of different races

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.393
from different continents,

00:01:20.417 --> 00:01:23.913
the actual DNA difference
is only 0.1 percent.

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:26.563
If we look at the genetic difference

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:30.721
between humans, great apes,
and rhesus macaques,

00:01:30.745 --> 00:01:32.674
that number is seven percent.

00:01:33.348 --> 00:01:37.459
In contrast, the genetic difference
between HIV subtypes

00:01:37.483 --> 00:01:39.058
from different patients

00:01:39.082 --> 00:01:41.555
may be as much as 35 percent.

00:01:42.094 --> 00:01:44.841
Within a person infected with HIV,

00:01:44.865 --> 00:01:48.261
the genetic difference
between an infecting mother virus

00:01:48.285 --> 00:01:50.610
and subsequent daughter viruses

00:01:50.634 --> 00:01:53.021
has been shown to be
as much as five percent.

00:01:53.376 --> 00:01:58.019
This is the equivalent of a gorilla
giving birth to a chimpanzee,

00:01:58.043 --> 00:01:59.871
then to an orangutan,

00:01:59.895 --> 00:02:01.454
then to a baboon,

00:02:01.478 --> 00:02:04.351
then to any random great ape
within its lifetime.

00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:08.316
There are nearly 100 subtypes of HIV,

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.809
with new subtypes
being discovered regularly.

00:02:11.448 --> 00:02:16.760
HIV in the developed world
is almost all of one subtype:

00:02:16.784 --> 00:02:17.937
subtype B.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.700
Mostly everything we know
and do to treat HIV

00:02:22.724 --> 00:02:26.281
is based on studies on subtype B,

00:02:26.305 --> 00:02:28.943
even though it only
accounts for 12 percent

00:02:28.967 --> 00:02:32.451
of the total number
of cases of HIV in the world.

00:02:33.182 --> 00:02:35.793
But because of the profound
genetic difference

00:02:35.817 --> 00:02:38.167
among different subtypes,

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:41.628
some subtypes are more likely
to become drug-resistant

00:02:42.168 --> 00:02:44.192
or progress to AIDS faster.

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:49.485
We discovered that the explosion
of HIV cases in the Philippines

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:53.741
is due to a shift
from the Western subtype B

00:02:53.765 --> 00:02:58.396
to a more aggressive
Southeast Asian subtype AE.

00:02:58.794 --> 00:03:01.525
We are seeing younger and sicker patients

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.529
with high rates of drug resistance.

00:03:04.195 --> 00:03:07.068
Initial encroachment of this subtype

00:03:07.092 --> 00:03:09.803
is already occurring
in developed countries,

00:03:09.827 --> 00:03:13.567
including Australia,
Canada and the United States.

00:03:13.591 --> 00:03:18.095
We may soon see a similar
explosion of cases in these countries.

00:03:19.393 --> 00:03:22.398
And while we think that HIV is done

00:03:22.422 --> 00:03:24.420
and that the tide has turned for it,

00:03:24.444 --> 00:03:27.410
just like with real tides,
it can come right back.

00:03:27.834 --> 00:03:31.270
In the early 1960s,
malaria was on the ropes.

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:33.289
As the number of cases dropped,

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:36.082
people and governments
stopped paying attention.

00:03:36.106 --> 00:03:40.860
The result was a deadly resurgence
of drug-resistant malaria.

00:03:41.562 --> 00:03:43.250
We need to think of HIV

00:03:43.274 --> 00:03:46.971
not as a single virus
that we think we've figured out,

00:03:46.995 --> 00:03:53.189
but as a collection of rapidly evolving
and highly unique viruses,

00:03:53.213 --> 00:03:55.993
each of which can set off
the next deadly epidemic.

00:03:56.474 --> 00:04:00.010
We are incorporating
more powerful and new tools

00:04:00.034 --> 00:04:03.169
to help us detect
the next deadly HIV strain,

00:04:03.193 --> 00:04:07.221
and this needs to go hand in hand
with urgent research

00:04:07.245 --> 00:04:11.717
on the behavior and proper treatment
of non-B subtypes.

00:04:12.201 --> 00:04:14.011
We need to convince our governments

00:04:14.035 --> 00:04:15.685
and our funding agencies

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.007
that HIV is not yet done.

00:04:20.357 --> 00:04:24.447
Over 35 million people have died of HIV.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:28.508
We are on the verge
of an AIDS-free generation.

00:04:28.532 --> 00:04:30.725
We need to pay attention.

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:33.082
We need to remain vigilant

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:34.603
and follow through.

00:04:34.627 --> 00:04:37.530
Otherwise, millions more will die.

00:04:37.554 --> 00:04:38.753
Thank you.

00:04:38.777 --> 00:04:43.191
(Applause)
