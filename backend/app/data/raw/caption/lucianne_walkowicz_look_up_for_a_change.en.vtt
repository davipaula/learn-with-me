00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.099
The sky is inherently democratic.

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.386
It's accessible, in principle anyway,
by anyone, everywhere,

00:00:23.386 --> 00:00:26.406
just simply by the act of looking up.

00:00:26.406 --> 00:00:29.494
But like so many
beautiful things around us,

00:00:29.494 --> 00:00:32.482
it's slipping away from us
and we haven't even noticed

00:00:32.482 --> 00:00:35.792
because we're honestly not really looking.

00:00:35.792 --> 00:00:37.688
So, what do we look at instead?

00:00:37.688 --> 00:00:41.908
Well, we look at our phones,
we look at our computers,

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:43.497
we look at screens of all kinds,

00:00:43.497 --> 00:00:48.722
and we rarely even take the trouble 
to look up enough to see each other,

00:00:48.722 --> 00:00:53.063
let alone taking that next step
to looking up at the actual sky.

00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:58.683
Now, there's a tendency to think
that the loss of our dark night skies

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:02.831
is the inevitable outcome
of progress, change, technology,

00:01:02.831 --> 00:01:07.064
and you know that's just simply not true,
and later on I'll tell you why.

00:01:07.064 --> 00:01:11.282
But first I want to tell you
about my experience of the dark night sky.

00:01:11.282 --> 00:01:18.055
I never saw a truly dark night sky
until I was 15, and I was here in Arizona.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.959
I was on a road trip,
I pulled over somewhere,

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:24.540
I have no idea where I was,
except I know what state.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.773
And I looked up,
and the sky was just filled

00:01:27.773 --> 00:01:30.853
with an impossible number of stars.

00:01:30.853 --> 00:01:32.996
You see, I'm from New York City,

00:01:32.996 --> 00:01:38.185
and in New York you can see the moon,
you can see a couple of stars,

00:01:38.185 --> 00:01:41.257
more often than not they turn out
to be airplanes when they land.

00:01:41.257 --> 00:01:43.923
But, you know there's really
not much else.

00:01:43.923 --> 00:01:47.683
As a result, most of my colleagues
who are astronomers

00:01:47.683 --> 00:01:51.615
spent at least part of their youth
looking up at the sky in their backyard.

00:01:51.615 --> 00:01:53.604
I never really had that experience

00:01:53.604 --> 00:01:57.424
and, as a result, I'm really
disappointing on camping trips.

00:01:57.424 --> 00:02:00.331
I don't really know many constellations,

00:02:00.331 --> 00:02:03.186
the ones I do know
you probably know them too.

00:02:03.946 --> 00:02:09.035
But I'll never forget that experience,
the first time I saw the dark night sky,

00:02:09.035 --> 00:02:13.136
and I was just flabbergasted
at how many stars there were,

00:02:13.136 --> 00:02:15.613
and I felt tiny.

00:02:15.943 --> 00:02:21.299
Then I also felt like,
"Where's this been hiding this whole time?

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.145
Who's been hiding this sky from me?"

00:02:24.145 --> 00:02:27.505
Of course, the answer is obvious
if you think about it,

00:02:27.505 --> 00:02:33.049
or if you look at the picture on the left 
where you're seeing the same neighborhood

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.273
taken during a blackout
versus on an ordinary night.

00:02:36.273 --> 00:02:39.634
You can't see the stars
if you drown them out with light.

00:02:40.644 --> 00:02:42.254
Take a look at our planet.

00:02:42.254 --> 00:02:44.379
This is our planet from space.

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:49.379
Unlike stars, which are hot and glow
invisible light so we can see them,

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:55.922
our planet is, astronomically speaking, 
pretty cold, so it doesn't really glow.

00:02:55.922 --> 00:03:00.875
When you see the planet looking like
a blue-green marble as in this picture,

00:03:00.875 --> 00:03:04.627
you're seeing it because the sunlight
is reflecting off it,

00:03:04.627 --> 00:03:08.058
and that's why you can see
the oceans, the clouds, the land.

00:03:08.058 --> 00:03:10.140
So, if the sun wasn't shining on it,

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.400
we wouldn't be able
to see the earth, right?

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.377
Or would we?

00:03:15.377 --> 00:03:19.447
This is our earth at night, and it is
one of the most striking examples

00:03:19.447 --> 00:03:22.733
of how we have affected
our planet on a global scale.

00:03:22.733 --> 00:03:27.447
You can see light spidering out
across the globe everywhere.

00:03:27.447 --> 00:03:30.874
Now, of course, there are broad expanses
of ocean that are still dark,

00:03:30.874 --> 00:03:34.759
and in many underdeveloped areas
there's still darkness.

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:38.633
But you'll notice that this is
a pretty global effect.

00:03:40.183 --> 00:03:44.910
We tend to think when we think of places
being lit up, of very extreme examples,

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.831
so, Times Square, the Vegas Strip.

00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:52.443
But really what that picture shows you
is it's not just these extreme examples,

00:03:52.443 --> 00:03:55.192
it's anywhere that uses outdoor lighting.

00:03:55.192 --> 00:03:58.683
This tends to be a really
dramatic effect on the ground.

00:03:58.683 --> 00:04:03.293
To understand why all you have to do
is think about the shape of a light bulb.

00:04:03.293 --> 00:04:07.713
So the light bulb, for all
practical purposes, is more or less round.

00:04:07.713 --> 00:04:11.503
This is great for its original intended
purpose of lighting up the indoors.

00:04:11.503 --> 00:04:13.670
You turn it on, light goes everywhere.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.456
An individual light bulb can light up
your whole room more or less.

00:04:17.456 --> 00:04:20.505
Now, that's great
if you're lighting the indoors,

00:04:20.505 --> 00:04:25.303
but in its application in outdoor lighting
that traditional shape of the light bulb,

00:04:25.303 --> 00:04:30.165
the sort of globe that spreads light
everywhere, is actually very inefficient.

00:04:30.165 --> 00:04:32.563
So, when you're outdoors
mostly what you care about

00:04:32.563 --> 00:04:36.623
is lighting the ground beneath you
and your immediate surroundings.

00:04:36.623 --> 00:04:40.644
All of that light that gets scattered
outwards and upwards

00:04:40.644 --> 00:04:43.081
doesn't actually help you
light the area around you,

00:04:43.081 --> 00:04:47.947
it scatters up into the sky and becomes
what we call "light pollution."

00:04:47.947 --> 00:04:51.539
Even if you don't care anything
about star gazing,

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.925
this should worry you because it means
that 60-70% of the energy we use

00:04:55.925 --> 00:05:00.612
to light the outdoors
is wasted by blotting out the stars.

00:05:01.852 --> 00:05:04.699
Now, like I said,
I'm a big fan of technology,

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:09.030
obviously I use technology
every day; I'm a scientist.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.620
There's this tendency
to say that its progress that...

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.635
you know, I'm not suggesting we're going
to all go and live by candlelight,

00:05:16.635 --> 00:05:20.271
and indeed technology
is allowing us to access the sky

00:05:20.271 --> 00:05:23.041
in ways that are impossible otherwise.

00:05:23.041 --> 00:05:27.507
One of the greatest examples of this is,
of course, the Hubble space telescope.

00:05:27.507 --> 00:05:31.377
The Hubble went up into space,
it returns pictures daily,

00:05:31.377 --> 00:05:36.168
and it allows us to see things that we are
incapable of seeing with our naked eye,

00:05:36.168 --> 00:05:41.181
in ways that we've never been able
to do before in all of human history.

00:05:41.181 --> 00:05:44.117
Other examples of this
would be planetarium shows.

00:05:44.117 --> 00:05:46.418
In the past couple of years 
planetarium shows

00:05:46.418 --> 00:05:50.228
have become more high-tech
with these great visualizations,

00:05:50.228 --> 00:05:52.746
and even though this isn't access
directly to the sky,

00:05:52.746 --> 00:05:55.857
it's at least access
to our knowledge about the sky.

00:05:55.857 --> 00:05:58.491
And indeed we can experience
the sky in a planetarium

00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:03.851
in a way that is impossible for us to do
just sitting out and looking in the dark.

00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:08.305
All of you have heard of the Hubble
space telescope and of planetariums,

00:06:08.305 --> 00:06:12.298
but there are also ways
for technology to enable participation

00:06:12.298 --> 00:06:15.828
in peoples' experience of the sky
that you may not be familiar with,

00:06:15.828 --> 00:06:18.576
and these are called
citizen science projects.

00:06:18.576 --> 00:06:23.280
Citizen science is when large
research projects put their data online,

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.760
teach ordinary people like you
to go and interact with that data

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.883
and actually contribute to the research

00:06:29.883 --> 00:06:34.073
by making interesting
or necessary characterizations about it.

00:06:34.073 --> 00:06:38.257
One such example of this is what
I'm showing here, called Galaxy Zoo.

00:06:38.257 --> 00:06:43.659
Galaxy Zoo is a project
where people get a 20-minute tutorial,

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:48.969
or even less, on how to interact
with these images of galaxies.

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:51.007
And they learn to annotate the images,

00:06:51.007 --> 00:06:53.487
and within a couple of minutes
they're up and running

00:06:53.487 --> 00:06:58.037
and making really useful categorizations
and classifications of these galaxies.

00:06:58.537 --> 00:07:00.593
It's easy to understand why Galaxy Zoo

00:07:00.593 --> 00:07:03.533
would be an easy sell
for people to be involved with,

00:07:03.533 --> 00:07:08.093
it involves pretty pictures,
galaxies are generally attractive.

00:07:08.093 --> 00:07:11.570
However, there are many other flavors
of citizen science projects

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:16.410
that people have delved into
that have varying levels of abstraction,

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:19.598
that you wouldn't necessarily think
that people would jump at.

00:07:19.598 --> 00:07:23.203
One such example of this
is the citizens science project

00:07:23.203 --> 00:07:26.423
associated with the mission
that I'm part of,

00:07:26.423 --> 00:07:27.823
called the Kepler Mission.

00:07:27.823 --> 00:07:32.632
Kepler is a space telescope and it looks
for planets around other stars

00:07:32.632 --> 00:07:35.749
by measuring the light
from those stars very precisely,

00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:37.888
and we're looking for the dimmings

00:07:37.888 --> 00:07:41.378
caused by stars blocking off
some of that light.

00:07:41.948 --> 00:07:46.298
We have an associated citizens science
project called Planet Hunters.

00:07:46.298 --> 00:07:50.678
Planet Hunters gives you,
like Galaxy Zoo, a short tutorial,

00:07:50.678 --> 00:07:53.122
and within a couple of minutes
you're up and running

00:07:53.122 --> 00:07:55.513
and you're looking at data
from the Kepler mission,

00:07:55.513 --> 00:07:57.773
and looking for planets.

00:07:57.773 --> 00:08:01.224
The idea behind this is an easy sell,

00:08:01.224 --> 00:08:05.930
but the actual process of planet hunting
involves a lot of looking at graphs,

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.781
like the one I'm showing you here,
and annotating them.

00:08:08.781 --> 00:08:12.935
I do this all day and that doesn't even
sound that interesting to me.

00:08:12.935 --> 00:08:16.870
However, not only are people
interested in doing this,

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.253
but the citizen scientists
that work with Planet Hunters

00:08:20.253 --> 00:08:23.053
have actually found planets in the data

00:08:23.053 --> 00:08:25.702
that would have gone
undiscovered otherwise.

00:08:25.702 --> 00:08:30.075
This is an author list from the paper
published of the planet they discovered,

00:08:30.075 --> 00:08:32.910
and you see all the people
who contributed are listed below,

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:34.783
and it's sort of an odd amalgam

00:08:34.783 --> 00:08:38.073
of people's real names
and their login names.

00:08:38.073 --> 00:08:41.843
You'll notice if you look carefully,
this is the first academic acknowledgment

00:08:41.843 --> 00:08:45.367
of the importance of Irish coffee
in the discovery process.

00:08:45.367 --> 00:08:47.102
(Laughter)

00:08:47.102 --> 00:08:51.254
I don't want to give you the idea
that these are some out-of-work scientists

00:08:51.254 --> 00:08:53.914
or just a bunch of nerds
that are really into this.

00:08:53.914 --> 00:08:57.267
There are 60 thousand people
who participate in these projects,

00:08:57.267 --> 00:08:59.879
and most of them 
don't have technical backgrounds.

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:03.549
So clearly, what this is feeding into
is peoples' curiosity

00:09:03.549 --> 00:09:07.409
and their willingness to be part
of the scientific discovery process.

00:09:07.409 --> 00:09:09.589
People want to do this.

00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:12.406
But, all of this technology

00:09:12.406 --> 00:09:16.386
and all these digitally-mediated ways
of experiencing the sky,

00:09:16.386 --> 00:09:21.171
they still have something of a feel to me
like looking at an animal in a zoo.

00:09:21.171 --> 00:09:23.816
It's a valid way
of experiencing that thing.

00:09:23.816 --> 00:09:26.621
Indeed, the lion in the cage
is still real,

00:09:26.621 --> 00:09:28.781
the Hubble images are indeed real,

00:09:28.781 --> 00:09:33.747
and you can get closer to a lion in a zoo
than you can in the wild.

00:09:33.747 --> 00:09:36.466
However, it's missing something.

00:09:36.466 --> 00:09:38.736
It's missing that savage beauty

00:09:38.736 --> 00:09:42.296
of experiencing that very thing
in the wild for yourself,

00:09:42.296 --> 00:09:44.395
unmediated by a screen.

00:09:44.955 --> 00:09:50.310
The experience of looking up and knowing
that the sky that you're looking at

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:54.268
surrounds every known
living thing in the universe,

00:09:54.268 --> 00:09:55.818
is very profound.

00:09:55.818 --> 00:09:57.426
Think about that for a moment.

00:09:57.426 --> 00:10:02.412
We are the only planet we know of
that has life on it.

00:10:02.412 --> 00:10:05.674
The sky that you see is shared
by every other living thing

00:10:05.674 --> 00:10:07.774
that we know of in existence.

00:10:08.674 --> 00:10:11.794
One of the things
that I really like about my work

00:10:11.794 --> 00:10:15.104
is that it allows me to step back
from my every day

00:10:15.104 --> 00:10:18.844
and to experience
the sort of larger context,

00:10:18.844 --> 00:10:21.275
this feeling that just as we go out

00:10:21.275 --> 00:10:26.444
and we try to find planets in the universe
that might be like ours,

00:10:26.444 --> 00:10:31.479
it always reminds me
of how precious what we have here is.

00:10:31.899 --> 00:10:37.623
Our night sky is like a natural resource,
as though it's a park that you can visit

00:10:37.623 --> 00:10:40.394
without ever having to travel there.

00:10:40.394 --> 00:10:42.175
But like any natural resource,

00:10:42.175 --> 00:10:45.482
if we don't protect it,
or we don't preserve it and treasure it,

00:10:45.482 --> 00:10:48.427
it will slip away from us and be gone.

00:10:48.427 --> 00:10:50.748
So, if you're interested in this

00:10:50.748 --> 00:10:53.458
and this is something
you want to learn more about,

00:10:53.458 --> 00:10:56.955
I encourage you in particular
to visit darksky.org

00:10:56.955 --> 00:10:59.215
and learn more 
about the choices you can make

00:10:59.215 --> 00:11:01.505
that can protect the dark night sky,

00:11:01.505 --> 00:11:04.762
because it belongs to everyone,
it belongs to all of us,

00:11:04.762 --> 00:11:07.701
and therefore it's ours
to experience as we wish.

00:11:07.701 --> 00:11:09.365
And it's also ours to lose.

00:11:09.365 --> 00:11:10.640
Thank you.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.606
(Applause)
