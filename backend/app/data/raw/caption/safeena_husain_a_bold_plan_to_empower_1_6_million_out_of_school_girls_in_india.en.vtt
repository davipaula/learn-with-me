00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:16.601
The world today has many problems.

00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:22.143
And they're all very complicated
and interconnected and difficult.

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:24.601
But there is something we can do.

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:25.893
I believe

00:00:25.917 --> 00:00:30.684
that girls' education is the closest thing
we have to a silver bullet

00:00:30.708 --> 00:00:35.101
to help solve some of the world's
most difficult problems.

00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:37.226
But you don't have to take my word for it.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.934
The World Bank says

00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:42.226
that girls' education
is one of the best investments

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.268
that a country can make.

00:00:44.292 --> 00:00:46.393
It helps to positively impact

00:00:46.417 --> 00:00:49.976
nine of the 17 Sustainable
Development Goals.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.434
Everything from health,
nutrition, employment --

00:00:54.458 --> 00:00:58.417
all of these are positively impacted
when girls are educated.

00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:04.809
Additionally, climate scientists
have recently rated girls' education

00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:10.559
at number six out of 80 actions
to reverse global warming.

00:01:10.583 --> 00:01:15.625
At number six, it's rated higher
than solar panels and electric cars.

00:01:17.542 --> 00:01:20.393
And that's because
when girls are educated,

00:01:20.417 --> 00:01:22.226
they have smaller families,

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.643
and the resulting reduction in population

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:29.000
reduces carbon emissions significantly.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.726
But more than that, you know,
it's a problem we have to solve once.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.059
Because an educated mother
is more than twice as likely

00:01:39.083 --> 00:01:41.101
to educate her children.

00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:43.143
Which means that by doing it once,

00:01:43.167 --> 00:01:47.226
we can close the gender
and literacy gap forever.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.684
I work in India,

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:51.559
which has made incredible progress

00:01:51.583 --> 00:01:54.809
in bringing elementary education for all.

00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:58.851
However, we still have
four million out-of-school girls,

00:01:58.875 --> 00:02:00.750
one of the highest in the world.

00:02:01.917 --> 00:02:05.601
And girls are out of school
because of, obviously poverty,

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:07.893
social, cultural factors.

00:02:07.917 --> 00:02:11.042
But there's also this
underlying factor of mindset.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.601
I have met a girl
whose name was Naraaz Nath.

00:02:15.625 --> 00:02:17.809
Naaraaz means angry.

00:02:17.833 --> 00:02:20.309
And when I asked her,
"Why is your name 'angry'?"

00:02:20.333 --> 00:02:24.750
she said, "Because everybody
was so angry when a girl was born."

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:28.601
Another girl called Antim Bala,

00:02:28.625 --> 00:02:30.893
which means the last girl.

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:34.208
Because everybody hoped
that would be the last girl to be born.

00:02:35.625 --> 00:02:37.333
A girl called Aachuki.

00:02:38.292 --> 00:02:40.351
It means somebody who has arrived.

00:02:40.375 --> 00:02:43.643
Not wanted, but arrived.

00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:45.809
And it is this mindset

00:02:45.833 --> 00:02:49.434
that keeps girls from school
or completing their education.

00:02:49.458 --> 00:02:52.143
It's this belief that a goat is an asset

00:02:52.167 --> 00:02:53.875
and a girl is a liability.

00:02:56.667 --> 00:03:00.143
My organization Educate Girls
works to change this.

00:03:00.167 --> 00:03:03.059
And we work in some
of the most difficult, rural,

00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:04.917
remote and tribal villages.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.518
And how do we do it?

00:03:07.542 --> 00:03:09.851
We first and foremost find

00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:14.059
young, passionate, educated youth
from the same villages.

00:03:14.083 --> 00:03:16.434
Both men and women.

00:03:16.458 --> 00:03:17.851
And we call them Team Balika,

00:03:17.875 --> 00:03:19.476
balika just means the girl child,

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.417
so this is a team that we are creating
for the girl child.

00:03:23.417 --> 00:03:26.309
And so once we recruit
our community volunteers,

00:03:26.333 --> 00:03:29.625
we train them, we mentor them,
we hand-hold them.

00:03:30.458 --> 00:03:32.018
That's when our work starts.

00:03:32.042 --> 00:03:36.393
And the first piece we do
is about identifying every single girl

00:03:36.417 --> 00:03:38.684
who's not going to school.

00:03:38.708 --> 00:03:41.934
But the way we do it
is a little different and high-tech,

00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.268
at least in my view.

00:03:44.292 --> 00:03:47.018
Each of our frontline staff
have a smartphone.

00:03:47.042 --> 00:03:49.726
It has its own Educate Girls app.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.934
And this app has everything
that our team needs.

00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:58.434
It has digital maps of where
they're going to be conducting the survey,

00:03:58.458 --> 00:04:00.768
it has the survey in it,
all the questions,

00:04:00.792 --> 00:04:03.643
little guides on how best
to conduct the survey,

00:04:03.667 --> 00:04:07.792
so that the data that comes to us
is in real time and is of good quality.

00:04:08.833 --> 00:04:10.101
So armed with this,

00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:13.518
our teams and our volunteers
go door-to-door

00:04:13.542 --> 00:04:17.309
to every single household
to find every single girl

00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:20.226
who may either we never enrolled
or dropped out of school.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.518
And because we have this data
and technology piece,

00:04:23.542 --> 00:04:27.476
very quickly we can figure out
who the girls are and where they are.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.934
Because each of our
villages are geotagged,

00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.351
and we can actually
build that information out

00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:33.875
very, very quickly.

00:04:34.542 --> 00:04:37.143
And so once we know where the girls are,

00:04:37.167 --> 00:04:40.893
we actually start the process
of bringing them back into school.

00:04:40.917 --> 00:04:43.809
And that actually is just
our community mobilization process,

00:04:43.833 --> 00:04:47.268
it starts with village meetings,
neighborhood meetings,

00:04:47.292 --> 00:04:51.226
and as you see, individual counseling
of parents and families,

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.893
to be able to bring the girls
back into school.

00:04:53.917 --> 00:04:58.542
And this can take anything
from a few weeks to a few months.

00:04:59.625 --> 00:05:02.059
And once we bring the girls
into the school system,

00:05:02.083 --> 00:05:03.518
we also work with the schools

00:05:03.542 --> 00:05:07.434
to make sure that schools
have all the basic infrastructure

00:05:07.458 --> 00:05:09.363
so that the girls will be able to stay.

00:05:09.387 --> 00:05:12.184
And this would include
a separate toilet for girls,

00:05:12.208 --> 00:05:13.809
drinking water,

00:05:13.833 --> 00:05:16.851
things that will help them to be retained.

00:05:16.875 --> 00:05:20.643
But all of this would be useless
if our children weren't learning.

00:05:20.667 --> 00:05:23.559
So we actually run a learning program.

00:05:23.583 --> 00:05:25.684
And this is a supplementary
learning program,

00:05:25.708 --> 00:05:28.018
and it's very, very important,

00:05:28.042 --> 00:05:31.893
because most of our children
are first-generation learners.

00:05:31.917 --> 00:05:34.809
That means there's nobody at home
to help them with homework,

00:05:34.833 --> 00:05:37.059
there's nobody who can support
their education.

00:05:37.083 --> 00:05:38.768
Their parents can't read and write.

00:05:38.792 --> 00:05:40.434
So it's really, really key

00:05:40.458 --> 00:05:44.601
that we do the support
of the learning in the classrooms.

00:05:44.625 --> 00:05:46.518
So this is essentially our model,

00:05:46.542 --> 00:05:48.851
in terms of finding,
bringing the girls in,

00:05:48.875 --> 00:05:51.476
making sure that
they're staying and learning.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.101
And we know that our model works.

00:05:54.125 --> 00:05:56.018
And we know this because

00:05:56.042 --> 00:05:59.184
a most recent randomized
control evaluation

00:05:59.208 --> 00:06:00.917
confirms its efficacy.

00:06:02.792 --> 00:06:06.518
Our evaluator found
that over a three-year period

00:06:06.542 --> 00:06:11.684
Educate Girls was able to bring back
92 percent of all out-of-school girls

00:06:11.708 --> 00:06:13.434
back into school.

00:06:13.458 --> 00:06:19.976
(Applause)

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.434
And in terms of learning,

00:06:21.458 --> 00:06:24.101
our children's learning
went up significantly

00:06:24.125 --> 00:06:26.226
as compared to control schools.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.143
So much so, that it was
like an additional year of schooling

00:06:30.167 --> 00:06:31.976
for the average student.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.393
And that's enormous,

00:06:33.417 --> 00:06:36.768
when you think about a tribal child
who's entering the school system

00:06:36.792 --> 00:06:38.167
for the first time.

00:06:39.042 --> 00:06:41.434
So here we have a model that works;

00:06:41.458 --> 00:06:43.434
we know it's scalable,

00:06:43.458 --> 00:06:47.101
because we are already functioning
at 13,000 villages.

00:06:47.125 --> 00:06:48.434
We know it's smart,

00:06:48.458 --> 00:06:51.393
because of the use of data and technology.

00:06:51.417 --> 00:06:54.184
We know that it's
sustainable and systemic,

00:06:54.208 --> 00:06:57.184
because we work in partnership
with the community,

00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:59.393
it's actually led by the community.

00:06:59.417 --> 00:07:01.643
And we work in partnership
with the government,

00:07:01.667 --> 00:07:04.375
so there's no creation
of a parallel delivery system.

00:07:05.417 --> 00:07:08.643
And so because we have
this innovative partnership

00:07:08.667 --> 00:07:12.559
with the community,
the government, this smart model,

00:07:12.583 --> 00:07:15.875
we have this big, audacious dream today.

00:07:17.042 --> 00:07:20.851
And that is to solve
a full 40 percent of the problem

00:07:20.875 --> 00:07:24.125
of out-of-school girls in India
in the next five years.

00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:31.351
(Applause)

00:07:31.375 --> 00:07:33.976
And you're thinking, that's a little ...

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.018
You know, how am I even thinking
about doing that,

00:07:37.042 --> 00:07:40.875
because India is not a small place,
it's a huge country.

00:07:42.042 --> 00:07:44.559
It's a country of over a billion people.

00:07:44.583 --> 00:07:48.518
We have 650,000 villages.

00:07:48.542 --> 00:07:50.184
How is it that I'm standing here,

00:07:50.208 --> 00:07:52.184
saying that one small organization

00:07:52.208 --> 00:07:55.417
is going to solve a full
40 percent of the problem?

00:07:56.125 --> 00:07:58.726
And that's because we have a key insight.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.018
And that is,

00:08:00.042 --> 00:08:04.518
because of our entire approach,
with data and with technology,

00:08:04.542 --> 00:08:07.226
that five percent of villages in India

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.268
have 40 percent
of the out-of-school girls.

00:08:10.292 --> 00:08:13.059
And this is a big,
big piece of the puzzle.

00:08:13.083 --> 00:08:16.268
Which means, I don't have to work
across the entire country.

00:08:16.292 --> 00:08:19.434
I have to work in those
five percent of the villages,

00:08:19.458 --> 00:08:21.518
about 35,000 villages,

00:08:21.542 --> 00:08:24.750
to actually be able to solve
a large piece of the problem.

00:08:25.875 --> 00:08:27.143
And that's really key,

00:08:27.167 --> 00:08:29.559
because these villages

00:08:29.583 --> 00:08:32.726
not only have high burden
of out-of-school girls,

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:35.601
but also a lot of
related indicators, right,

00:08:35.625 --> 00:08:40.976
like malnutrition, stunting,
poverty, infant mortality,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.684
child marriage.

00:08:42.708 --> 00:08:44.643
So by working and focusing here,

00:08:44.667 --> 00:08:47.143
you can actually create
a large multiplier effect

00:08:47.167 --> 00:08:49.768
across all of these indicators.

00:08:49.792 --> 00:08:51.058
And it would mean

00:08:51.082 --> 00:08:55.457
that we would be able to bring back
1.6 million girls back into school.

00:08:56.792 --> 00:09:02.875
(Applause)

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.184
I have to say, I have been
doing this for over a decade,

00:09:07.208 --> 00:09:12.018
and I have never met a girl
who said to me,

00:09:12.042 --> 00:09:13.768
you know, "I want to stay at home,"

00:09:13.792 --> 00:09:15.184
"I want to graze the cattle,"

00:09:15.208 --> 00:09:17.476
"I want to look after the siblings,"

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.518
"I want to be a child bride."

00:09:19.542 --> 00:09:23.750
Every single girl I meet
wants to go to school.

00:09:24.917 --> 00:09:26.893
And that's what we really want to do.

00:09:26.917 --> 00:09:31.042
We want to be able to fulfill
those 1.6 million dreams.

00:09:32.625 --> 00:09:33.934
And it doesn't take much.

00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:37.893
To find and enroll a girl
with our model is about 20 dollars.

00:09:37.917 --> 00:09:41.101
To make sure that she is learning
and providing a learning program,

00:09:41.125 --> 00:09:43.393
it's another 40 dollars.

00:09:43.417 --> 00:09:45.559
But today is the time to do it.

00:09:45.583 --> 00:09:49.726
Because she is truly
the biggest asset we have.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:53.101
I am Safeena Husain, and I educate girls.

00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:54.393
Thank you.

00:09:54.417 --> 00:09:57.958
(Applause)
