00:00:14.504 --> 00:00:15.747
Imagine a world

00:00:15.747 --> 00:00:17.892
in which you see numbers and letters as colored

00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:19.750
even though they're printed in black,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.833
in which music or voices trigger a swirl

00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:23.922
of moving, colored shapes,

00:00:23.922 --> 00:00:25.858
in which words and names fill your mouth

00:00:25.858 --> 00:00:27.592
with unusual flavors.

00:00:27.592 --> 00:00:30.437
Jail tastes like cold, hard bacon

00:00:30.437 --> 00:00:33.123
while Derek tastes like earwax.

00:00:34.091 --> 00:00:35.807
Welcome to synesthesia,

00:00:35.807 --> 00:00:37.072
the neurological phenomenon

00:00:37.072 --> 00:00:41.032
that couples two or more senses in 4% of the population.

00:00:41.032 --> 00:00:43.505
A synesthete might not only hear my voice,

00:00:43.505 --> 00:00:44.413
but also see it,

00:00:44.413 --> 00:00:44.920
taste it,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.555
or feel it as a physical touch.

00:00:48.771 --> 00:00:51.065
Sharing the same root with anesthesia,

00:00:51.065 --> 00:00:52.400
meaning no sensation,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.152
synesthesia means joined sensation.

00:00:55.152 --> 00:00:57.446
Having one type, such as colored hearing,

00:00:57.446 --> 00:00:59.699
gives you a 50% chance of having a second,

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:00.116
third,

00:01:00.116 --> 00:01:01.609
or fourth type.

00:01:03.702 --> 00:01:06.764
One in 90 among us experience graphemes,

00:01:06.764 --> 00:01:08.312
the written elements of language,

00:01:08.312 --> 00:01:08.975
like letters,

00:01:08.975 --> 00:01:09.434
numerals,

00:01:09.434 --> 00:01:10.797
and punctuation marks,

00:01:10.797 --> 00:01:12.850
as saturated with color.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.313
Some even have gender or personality.

00:01:15.313 --> 00:01:19.502
For Gail, 3 is athletic and sporty,

00:01:19.502 --> 00:01:22.319
9 is a vain, elitist girl.

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:24.694
By contrast, the sound units of language,

00:01:24.694 --> 00:01:25.946
or phonemes,

00:01:25.946 --> 00:01:27.863
trigger synestetic tastes.

00:01:27.863 --> 00:01:30.369
For James, college tastes like sausage,

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.411
as does message and similar words

00:01:32.411 --> 00:01:34.206
with the -age ending.

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:38.542
Synesthesia is a trait, like having blue eyes,

00:01:38.542 --> 00:01:40.125
rather than a disorder

00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:41.754
because there's nothing wrong.

00:01:41.754 --> 00:01:43.104
In fact, all the extra hooks

00:01:43.104 --> 00:01:45.997
endow synesthetes with superior memories.

00:01:45.997 --> 00:01:49.309
For example, a girl runs into someone she met long ago.

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:51.346
"Let's see, she had a green name.

00:01:51.346 --> 00:01:52.310
D's are green:

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.847
Debra,

00:01:52.847 --> 00:01:53.229
Darby,

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:53.646
Dorothy,

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:54.146
Denise.

00:01:54.146 --> 00:01:56.920
Yes! Her name is Denise!"

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.359
Once established in childhood,

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:00.736
pairings remain fixed for life.

00:02:00.736 --> 00:02:03.254
Synesthetes inherit a biological propensity

00:02:03.254 --> 00:02:05.282
for hyperconnecting brain neurons,

00:02:05.282 --> 00:02:08.017
but then must be exposed to cultural artifacts,

00:02:08.017 --> 00:02:08.870
such as calendars,

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:09.536
food names,

00:02:09.536 --> 00:02:11.245
and alphabets.

00:02:11.245 --> 00:02:13.833
The amazing thing is that a single nucleotide change

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:17.378
in the sequence of one's DNA alters perception.

00:02:17.378 --> 00:02:19.793
In this way, synesthesia provides a path

00:02:19.793 --> 00:02:22.049
to understanding subjective differences,

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.385
how two people can see the same thing differently.

00:02:25.385 --> 00:02:27.972
Take Sean, who prefers blue tasting food,

00:02:27.972 --> 00:02:30.303
such as milk, oranges, and spinach.

00:02:30.303 --> 00:02:32.691
The gene heightens normally occurring connections

00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:34.939
between the taste area in his frontal lobe

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.481
and the color area further back.

00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:39.269
But suppose in someone else

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.683
that the gene acted in non-sensory areas.

00:02:41.683 --> 00:02:43.579
You would then have the ability to link

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.772
seemingly unrelated things,

00:02:45.772 --> 00:02:47.948
which is the definition of metaphor,

00:02:47.948 --> 00:02:50.787
seeing the similar in the dissimilar.

00:02:50.787 --> 00:02:52.997
Not surprisingly, synesthesia is more common

00:02:52.997 --> 00:02:55.374
in artists who excel at making metaphors,

00:02:55.374 --> 00:02:57.541
like novelist Vladimir Nabokov,

00:02:57.541 --> 00:02:59.293
painter David Hockney,

00:02:59.293 --> 00:03:00.693
and composers Billy Joel

00:03:00.693 --> 00:03:02.219
and Lady Gaga.

00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:06.002
But why do the rest of us non-synesthetes

00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:08.583
understand metaphors like "sharp cheese"

00:03:08.583 --> 00:03:10.632
or "sweet person"?

00:03:10.632 --> 00:03:12.009
It so happens that sight,

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.342
sound,

00:03:12.342 --> 00:03:12.891
and movement

00:03:12.891 --> 00:03:15.300
already map to one another so closely,

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.732
that even bad ventriloquists convince us

00:03:17.732 --> 00:03:19.646
that the dummy is talking.

00:03:19.646 --> 00:03:21.478
Movies, likewise, can convince us

00:03:21.478 --> 00:03:23.526
that the sound is coming from the actors' mouths

00:03:23.526 --> 00:03:25.694
rather than surrounding speakers.

00:03:25.694 --> 00:03:28.447
So, inwardly, we're all synesthetes,

00:03:28.447 --> 00:03:30.449
outwardly unaware of the perceptual couplings

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:32.533
happening all the time.

00:03:32.533 --> 00:03:34.748
Cross-talk in the brain is the rule,

00:03:34.748 --> 00:03:36.435
not the exception.

00:03:37.643 --> 00:03:41.010
And that sounds like a sweet deal to me!
