00:00:12.874 --> 00:00:15.350
Hey look, if you guys
are anything like me,

00:00:15.374 --> 00:00:18.723
you have found it harder and harder
to turn around recently

00:00:18.747 --> 00:00:21.301
without seeing words like "free-range,"

00:00:21.325 --> 00:00:22.603
"farm-to-table,"

00:00:22.627 --> 00:00:24.154
"organically produced,"

00:00:24.178 --> 00:00:26.186
especially here in Colorado.

00:00:26.712 --> 00:00:31.041
Now, as we've become more conscientious
of the way that we eat in recent years,

00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:35.742
these once unfamiliar words have worked
their way into our daily lexicon.

00:00:36.605 --> 00:00:38.367
When we started to pay more attention

00:00:38.391 --> 00:00:42.328
to the way that the food we were eating
interacted with our bodies

00:00:42.352 --> 00:00:43.775
and with the earth,

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:45.767
the food industry had to listen.

00:00:46.277 --> 00:00:48.586
And the results have been really powerful.

00:00:49.965 --> 00:00:54.698
Now, those of you out there
from states like Washington and Oregon

00:00:54.722 --> 00:00:57.055
and, of course, my fellow Coloradans --

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.768
(Cheers)

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:00.623
y'all know what I'm talking about.

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:05.404
Because this is not ...

00:01:05.428 --> 00:01:11.268
Words like "all-natural" and "homegrown"
are not just being used in our diets.

00:01:11.292 --> 00:01:15.179
There's this whole new industry
using this language now.

00:01:17.052 --> 00:01:18.250
You guys know.

00:01:18.274 --> 00:01:19.606
It's weed,

00:01:20.352 --> 00:01:22.029
an industry that taxed a sale

00:01:22.053 --> 00:01:26.005
of about six billion dollars
worth of product in 2016.

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:28.801
So what if I were to propose to you

00:01:28.825 --> 00:01:33.098
that some of what you think you know
about this legalized marijuana thing

00:01:33.122 --> 00:01:34.348
could be wrong?

00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:36.936
Listen, I get it --

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.551
talking about issues with legal weed
is a pretty quick way to get uninvited

00:01:40.575 --> 00:01:41.859
from the cool kids' table.

00:01:41.883 --> 00:01:45.035
I know that better than most,

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:46.978
but I intend to do it anyway.

00:01:48.057 --> 00:01:52.639
First, before I get started, let me
be perfectly clear about one thing:

00:01:52.663 --> 00:01:56.678
my fight is not against the casual
adult use of marijuana --

00:01:56.702 --> 00:01:58.508
I don't care about that.

00:01:59.184 --> 00:02:01.862
What I care deeply about
is this new industry

00:02:01.886 --> 00:02:05.201
that is working to convince us
that we are consuming something natural

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:07.513
while fixing social ills,

00:02:07.537 --> 00:02:08.694
when we aren't.

00:02:09.485 --> 00:02:11.618
So let's start with
a little bit of Weed 101.

00:02:12.134 --> 00:02:15.759
Cannabis is a plant that grows naturally
and has been used within textiles

00:02:15.783 --> 00:02:18.925
and even traditional Chinese medicine
for thousands of years.

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:22.297
Genesis 1:12 even tells us:

00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:26.544
"I have given you all of the seed-bearing
plants and herbs to use."

00:02:26.568 --> 00:02:30.000
It's the microphone -- it's got
a TV preacher sort of thing.

00:02:30.024 --> 00:02:32.092
(Laughter)

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:36.151
Now, cannabis is made up of hundreds
of different chemicals,

00:02:36.175 --> 00:02:39.893
but two of those chemicals
are by far the most interesting.

00:02:39.917 --> 00:02:42.484
That's CBD and THC.

00:02:42.944 --> 00:02:47.100
CBD is where almost all
of the medicinal properties lie.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.227
It's an incredibly fascinating
part of the plant

00:02:50.251 --> 00:02:52.978
with real potential to help people.

00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:56.708
It also is totally nonintoxicating.

00:02:57.525 --> 00:03:00.872
You could take a bath in the stuff
while vaping pure CBD

00:03:00.896 --> 00:03:03.105
and drinking a CBD smoothie,

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.402
and you still couldn't get high.

00:03:05.426 --> 00:03:06.576
(Laughter)

00:03:07.275 --> 00:03:08.496
I've tried.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.535
(Laughter)

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:11.845
I haven't, I haven't.

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:13.446
That'd cost a lot of money.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.608
(Laughter)

00:03:16.703 --> 00:03:20.660
Now, for as interesting and remarkable
a part of the plant as CBD is,

00:03:20.684 --> 00:03:23.977
it actually makes up a really tiny portion
of the commercial market.

00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:26.600
The real money is being made
in that other chemical --

00:03:26.624 --> 00:03:27.774
in THC.

00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:31.043
THC is the natural part of the plant
that gets you high.

00:03:31.067 --> 00:03:32.965
And before the 1970s,

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.839
cannabis contained less than half
of a percent of THC.

00:03:36.863 --> 00:03:38.737
That's what's naturally occurring.

00:03:38.761 --> 00:03:43.064
Over the last 40 years,
as we became better gardeners, that --

00:03:43.088 --> 00:03:44.222
(Laughter)

00:03:44.246 --> 00:03:49.140
that percentage of THC started
to slowly but steadily rise,

00:03:49.941 --> 00:03:53.403
until recently, when the chemists
started to get involved.

00:03:53.991 --> 00:03:56.424
So these guys moved grow cycles --

00:03:56.448 --> 00:04:00.740
sorry -- these guys moved cultivation
exclusively indoors,

00:04:00.764 --> 00:04:04.338
and they made grow cycles
extremely and unnaturally short.

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.742
They also started to use
pesticides and fertilizers

00:04:07.766 --> 00:04:09.954
in some ways that we
should be concerned with.

00:04:10.612 --> 00:04:12.616
In fact, I was recently talking to a buddy

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.415
who had just left a job
at a commercial grow operation

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:17.630
because he was so concerned
with the chemicals

00:04:17.654 --> 00:04:19.615
that he was being asked to interact with.

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.216
Some of his fellow employees
were actually encouraged

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.339
to wear hazmat suits

00:04:24.363 --> 00:04:27.284
while they were spraying
the chemical cocktails on the plants.

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:30.878
With that kind of manipulation,

00:04:30.902 --> 00:04:35.509
the products that are being sold today
can contain above 30 percent THC.

00:04:36.338 --> 00:04:38.334
And our concentrates --

00:04:38.358 --> 00:04:42.672
our concentrates can actually contain
above 95 percent THC --

00:04:43.632 --> 00:04:45.616
a far cry from the natural plant.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.200
Listen, this isn't your grandpa's weed.

00:04:51.224 --> 00:04:52.700
(Laughter)

00:04:52.724 --> 00:04:55.274
This isn't your dad's weed.

00:04:55.298 --> 00:04:58.135
Like, this isn't even my weed.

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:59.334
(Laughter)

00:05:00.523 --> 00:05:03.734
If you've ever set foot inside
one of the thousands of dispensaries

00:05:03.758 --> 00:05:05.550
that have sprung up in recent years,

00:05:05.574 --> 00:05:08.975
you know that what we're
really selling in them is THC.

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:14.351
All of the weed that you buy commercially
lists exactly how much THC it contains,

00:05:14.375 --> 00:05:17.378
as do our other,
much more popular products

00:05:17.402 --> 00:05:21.790
like vape pens, coffee, ice cream,

00:05:21.814 --> 00:05:25.200
condiments, granola, gum, candy,

00:05:25.224 --> 00:05:26.812
baked goods,

00:05:26.836 --> 00:05:28.272
suppositories.

00:05:28.296 --> 00:05:29.301
(Laughter)

00:05:29.325 --> 00:05:31.049
And, of course, lube.

00:05:31.542 --> 00:05:33.618
Pretty much -- no, for real --

00:05:33.642 --> 00:05:35.454
(Laughter)

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.536
pretty much anything that you can imagine
introducing into the human body.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.552
The vast majority of cannabis
that's being sold today --

00:05:45.576 --> 00:05:47.153
it isn't really cannabis.

00:05:47.954 --> 00:05:50.881
It's THC in either a pure form

00:05:50.905 --> 00:05:54.733
or in an extremely high
and unnatural concentration.

00:05:54.757 --> 00:05:58.459
To say that we have legalized weed
is subtly misleading.

00:05:58.792 --> 00:06:01.383
We have commercialized THC.

00:06:02.371 --> 00:06:04.435
And it's happened really quickly.

00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:08.457
Now, the reason why the commercial market
has so rapidly exploded

00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:11.222
is because there is a hell
of a lot of money to be made

00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:15.332
in satisfying and increasing
our desire to get high.

00:06:15.862 --> 00:06:19.917
And that money is no longer really
being made by the mom-and-pop shops.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.052
So industry groups and corporations --

00:06:23.076 --> 00:06:24.880
groups like the Drug Policy Alliance,

00:06:24.904 --> 00:06:26.439
the Marijuana Policy Project,

00:06:26.463 --> 00:06:27.629
Arcview Investment,

00:06:27.653 --> 00:06:30.000
the Cannabis Industry Association --

00:06:30.024 --> 00:06:34.435
they've chased out and helped to chase out
a lot of the small-time growers.

00:06:35.274 --> 00:06:40.973
So these cats know that the best way
to continue to profit off of us

00:06:40.997 --> 00:06:44.012
is if they follow the alcohol
industry's 80/20 rule.

00:06:44.036 --> 00:06:47.215
It's simple -- it's where 80 percent
of the product is consumed

00:06:47.239 --> 00:06:50.501
by 20 percent of the consumers --
the problemed users.

00:06:51.631 --> 00:06:55.414
The wealthy, white, weed lobbyists --

00:06:55.438 --> 00:07:00.452
and seriously, they are almost
all rich, white men --

00:07:01.595 --> 00:07:04.424
they know that we will consume
more of what they're selling

00:07:04.448 --> 00:07:06.113
if they jack up the potency.

00:07:07.019 --> 00:07:11.813
They also know that we are more than
twice as likely to consume THC regularly

00:07:11.837 --> 00:07:14.768
if we earn under 20,000 dollars a year

00:07:14.792 --> 00:07:17.722
than those who earn
over 50,000 dollars a year.

00:07:18.503 --> 00:07:21.436
In other words, the poorer you are,

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.476
the more likely you are to spend
your money on their products.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:31.579
And in this country, income
and race are highly correlated.

00:07:33.192 --> 00:07:36.697
One of the reasons we often hear cited
for the legalization of marijuana

00:07:36.721 --> 00:07:40.461
is that it will help to stop
the disproportionate incarceration rates

00:07:40.485 --> 00:07:41.646
among minorities,

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.828
which is something everybody in this room
should be extremely concerned with.

00:07:47.084 --> 00:07:49.622
Unfortunately, we don't
have to look any further

00:07:49.646 --> 00:07:52.140
than arrest rates for juveniles
here in Colorado

00:07:52.164 --> 00:07:53.529
to counter that argument.

00:07:54.048 --> 00:07:56.742
According to the Colorado
Department of Public Safety,

00:07:57.949 --> 00:08:00.783
since we opened retail in 2014 --

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:05.621
almost all of which are in poor,
minority neighborhoods --

00:08:06.646 --> 00:08:10.221
we saw an eight percent reduction
in the arrest of white kids

00:08:10.245 --> 00:08:12.069
for all weed-related activity.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:15.292
Good on 'em.

00:08:16.472 --> 00:08:18.115
During that same time period,

00:08:18.139 --> 00:08:21.689
there was a 29 percent increase
in the arrest of Hispanic kids

00:08:21.713 --> 00:08:23.242
for weed-related activity

00:08:23.266 --> 00:08:29.133
and a 58 percent increase in the arrest
of black kids for weed-related crimes.

00:08:29.157 --> 00:08:31.033
You guys heard that, right?

00:08:31.057 --> 00:08:34.628
We are actually arresting
more people of color in Colorado

00:08:34.652 --> 00:08:37.111
than we were prior to commercialization.

00:08:38.036 --> 00:08:40.276
And you're not reading that in the Post.

00:08:42.617 --> 00:08:44.320
Colorado Department of Safety.

00:08:44.344 --> 00:08:46.145
Legal marijuana coming into focus.

00:08:48.313 --> 00:08:51.823
Another big issue that we have
is in school suspension rates.

00:08:52.354 --> 00:08:55.173
So, schools that are
predominantly white --

00:08:55.197 --> 00:08:59.303
that is, they have a minority population
of 25 percent or fewer --

00:08:59.327 --> 00:09:03.416
in the first full year of data collection
following commercialization,

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.575
these schools had a grand total
of 190 drug-related suspensions,

00:09:08.599 --> 00:09:11.371
almost all of which are for THC.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:13.872
At the same time,

00:09:13.896 --> 00:09:19.161
schools with a minority population
of 75 to 100 percent

00:09:19.185 --> 00:09:24.212
had 801 drug-related suspensions,

00:09:24.236 --> 00:09:26.005
almost all of which were for THC.

00:09:27.303 --> 00:09:29.404
When discussing minority populations,

00:09:29.428 --> 00:09:33.128
one that unfortunately often
gets left out of the conversation

00:09:33.152 --> 00:09:35.081
is the LGBTQ community.

00:09:36.448 --> 00:09:41.467
Members of this community are more
than twice as likely to consume THC

00:09:41.491 --> 00:09:44.895
than those who identify
as heterosexual or cisgender.

00:09:46.115 --> 00:09:50.604
They also, unfortunately, have
higher rates of mental illness

00:09:50.628 --> 00:09:51.809
and suicide.

00:09:52.824 --> 00:09:55.729
According to a study published in 2014
called "Going to Pot,"

00:09:55.753 --> 00:10:00.316
we see that the unnaturally high levels
of THC found in today's products

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.046
actually compound those issues.

00:10:03.515 --> 00:10:04.893
They make them worse.

00:10:06.184 --> 00:10:09.472
Unfortunately, that seems
to matter very little

00:10:09.496 --> 00:10:11.559
to the folks who are
selling these products,

00:10:11.583 --> 00:10:13.294
because as you just saw,

00:10:13.318 --> 00:10:16.053
clearly, this is a good consumer base.

00:10:17.828 --> 00:10:19.067
Listen, man -- I get it.

00:10:19.091 --> 00:10:23.451
In many circles, legalized marijuana
is too much of a sacred cow to question.

00:10:24.254 --> 00:10:26.926
But we need to start this conversation,

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:30.508
because what's being sold today
is not natural,

00:10:31.587 --> 00:10:36.104
and lobbyists and industry are using
social justice as a smoke screen

00:10:36.128 --> 00:10:37.938
so that they can get richer.

00:10:40.972 --> 00:10:44.922
It's been my own journey to sobriety
that led me to begin questioning

00:10:44.946 --> 00:10:46.273
a lot of what I was seeing;

00:10:46.297 --> 00:10:49.052
that's kind of one of the things
that we're taught to do.

00:10:49.723 --> 00:10:53.196
When I left Boulder
for the Washington, DC, area

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.429
at 12 years old,

00:10:54.453 --> 00:10:57.813
I was transported into a world
where the kind of shoes you wore

00:10:57.837 --> 00:11:00.417
mattered more than
just about anything else.

00:11:00.441 --> 00:11:04.720
And my family was just too poor
to help me play that game.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.752
So I was faced with a pretty real
crisis of identity.

00:11:09.554 --> 00:11:12.695
In this new scene where there's more
blacktop than treetops,

00:11:12.719 --> 00:11:14.857
man, I just didn't know who I was.

00:11:14.881 --> 00:11:16.634
So I smoked weed for the first time

00:11:16.658 --> 00:11:17.814
when I was 13.

00:11:17.838 --> 00:11:20.482
And I loved it.

00:11:20.506 --> 00:11:21.685
(Laughter)

00:11:21.709 --> 00:11:24.717
I instantly found this social group,

00:11:24.741 --> 00:11:28.026
and I also just really liked being high.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.725
I finally found a way to shut this up.

00:11:33.149 --> 00:11:36.246
I quickly turned to other
drugs and alcohol,

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:39.731
and something just woke up
inside of my brain.

00:11:40.071 --> 00:11:42.555
I was a daily user
within a couple of months.

00:11:42.579 --> 00:11:45.274
My addictive use mirrors
many of the stories

00:11:45.298 --> 00:11:47.165
that I'm sure you've heard before.

00:11:47.189 --> 00:11:49.007
It started out as fun,

00:11:49.031 --> 00:11:50.547
it got scary,

00:11:50.571 --> 00:11:52.456
and then it was just necessary.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:54.617
Enough said.

00:11:56.039 --> 00:11:59.806
I got wasted for the last time
on June 15 of 1996.

00:12:00.446 --> 00:12:01.607
And I --

00:12:01.631 --> 00:12:06.880
(Applause and cheers)

00:12:09.991 --> 00:12:11.141
Thank you.

00:12:12.342 --> 00:12:17.858
And I've spent the last 21 years
trying to both put my life back in order

00:12:17.882 --> 00:12:21.522
as well as trying to find
some peace in this world.

00:12:23.029 --> 00:12:24.743
And one of the ways I've done that

00:12:24.767 --> 00:12:27.625
is by working inside of nonprofit
drug and alcohol treatment

00:12:27.649 --> 00:12:28.802
for the last 10 years,

00:12:28.826 --> 00:12:30.877
with groups like Phoenix Multisport,

00:12:30.901 --> 00:12:32.991
the University of Colorado Hospital

00:12:33.015 --> 00:12:34.816
and NALGAP --

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:39.835
the National Association for Lesbian, Gay,
Transgender, Bisexual Treatment Providers

00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:41.052
and their Allies.

00:12:42.662 --> 00:12:45.534
Even after all of my work
on the front lines

00:12:45.558 --> 00:12:48.815
and as a former consumer myself,

00:12:48.839 --> 00:12:51.961
I was shocked and pissed
when I started to see

00:12:51.985 --> 00:12:54.500
what commercialization
was doing to cannabis,

00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:58.635
because, you see, our hope
for something pure and natural

00:12:58.659 --> 00:13:01.665
is making it hard for us to see
what's really going on,

00:13:01.689 --> 00:13:03.996
and that is that the rich
are getting richer

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.328
on the backs of the poor

00:13:05.352 --> 00:13:07.959
and lying to our faces the entire time.

00:13:08.945 --> 00:13:12.171
(Applause)

00:13:12.195 --> 00:13:13.345
Thank you.

00:13:14.921 --> 00:13:21.029
My friends, once again I fear
that we are allowing industry

00:13:21.053 --> 00:13:24.483
to take advantage of the most
challenged among us

00:13:24.507 --> 00:13:26.224
in order to turn a profit,

00:13:26.248 --> 00:13:30.613
much like we saw with tobacco
and food in years past.

00:13:31.371 --> 00:13:33.004
So when we told the food industry

00:13:33.028 --> 00:13:36.526
that we understood the impact
our choices were having,

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:40.660
and that we demanded better
for ourselves and our families,

00:13:40.684 --> 00:13:42.645
that industry got into line.

00:13:43.544 --> 00:13:47.719
So is there any reason why we couldn't
demand the same thing from this

00:13:47.743 --> 00:13:51.260
and from future industries who are trying
to get a piece of our paychecks?

00:13:52.327 --> 00:13:55.011
What if we made these guys answer
some hard questions?

00:13:56.129 --> 00:13:59.669
What if we held them to a higher standard
than we are right now?

00:14:00.241 --> 00:14:02.337
Because as it stands,

00:14:02.361 --> 00:14:04.454
for many in our community,

00:14:05.191 --> 00:14:08.428
the grass isn't greener on this side
of commercialization.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.516
They've just been sold a bag of goods.

00:14:12.121 --> 00:14:13.272
Thank you.

00:14:13.296 --> 00:14:17.168
(Applause)

00:14:20.182 --> 00:14:22.413
Jeremy Duhon: I know
this is a sensitive topic

00:14:22.437 --> 00:14:23.631
but a very important one,

00:14:23.655 --> 00:14:27.259
so thank you for bringing this up
and helping us explore it.

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:30.893
You know, a lot of folks
are experiencing health benefits

00:14:30.917 --> 00:14:32.625
from marijuana and cannabis.

00:14:32.649 --> 00:14:35.307
What would you say
to that part of the community?

00:14:35.331 --> 00:14:37.617
Ben Cort: I'm actually glad
you brought that up.

00:14:37.641 --> 00:14:40.815
I think one of the most important things
that we can do right now

00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:42.821
is to separate out medicinal,

00:14:42.845 --> 00:14:44.704
and especially what's happening

00:14:44.728 --> 00:14:47.117
and some of the advances
that are being made

00:14:47.141 --> 00:14:50.456
using parts of this plant and even
some whole-plant medicines,

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.453
from the commercial market for THC.

00:14:53.477 --> 00:14:55.738
That's, I think, crucial.

00:14:55.762 --> 00:14:57.690
We've got to stop putting them together,

00:14:57.714 --> 00:15:00.656
and we've got to say, "OK, here's
the part about getting high,

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.038
and here's the part about the medicine."

00:15:03.062 --> 00:15:05.645
(Applause)

00:15:06.928 --> 00:15:12.768
JD: So it sounds like your talk
is less about being anti-cannabis

00:15:12.792 --> 00:15:16.771
and more about raising awareness
about aspects of commercialization.

00:15:16.795 --> 00:15:18.525
Is that a fair way to put it?

00:15:18.549 --> 00:15:22.207
BC: Yes. So, I am not the anti-weed guy.

00:15:22.231 --> 00:15:23.844
(Laughter)

00:15:23.868 --> 00:15:26.826
I'm the pro-logic guy.

00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:30.827
For me to cast stones --
listen, I'm a drug addict.

00:15:30.851 --> 00:15:33.311
I don't get to do that,
and I don't want to do that.

00:15:33.335 --> 00:15:35.659
But what's bothering me
and what's so hard for me

00:15:35.683 --> 00:15:38.859
is to see the way
that we are just embracing

00:15:38.883 --> 00:15:40.706
without asking the hard questions,

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:42.744
when if this was another industry,

00:15:42.768 --> 00:15:45.327
we'd be holding their feet
to the fire on some stuff.

00:15:45.351 --> 00:15:48.015
And no, I'm not the anti-weed guy,

00:15:48.039 --> 00:15:49.647
I'm the pro-thought guy.

00:15:49.671 --> 00:15:50.848
So: think.

00:15:50.872 --> 00:15:53.278
I don't even care
if you're smoking when you do it,

00:15:53.302 --> 00:15:54.888
just so long as you're an adult.

00:15:54.912 --> 00:15:56.252
So long as you're an adult,

00:15:56.276 --> 00:15:57.563
just think.

00:15:58.657 --> 00:16:02.148
(Applause)
