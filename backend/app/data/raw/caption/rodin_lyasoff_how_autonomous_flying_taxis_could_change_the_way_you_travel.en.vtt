00:00:12.872 --> 00:00:14.182
I love airplanes.

00:00:14.206 --> 00:00:15.841
Oh -- I love airplanes.

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.333
So, when I went to college
in the late 90s,

00:00:19.357 --> 00:00:21.863
it was obvious that I was
going to study aerospace.

00:00:21.887 --> 00:00:24.252
And you wouldn't believe
how many people told me,

00:00:24.276 --> 00:00:26.363
"Oh no, not aerospace.

00:00:26.387 --> 00:00:27.927
Aerospace is going to be boring,

00:00:27.951 --> 00:00:30.305
everything in aerospace
has already been done."

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.661
Well, they were a little bit off the mark.

00:00:33.685 --> 00:00:35.423
And in fact, I think the next decade

00:00:35.447 --> 00:00:37.645
is going to be another
golden age for aviation.

00:00:37.669 --> 00:00:39.868
For one thing, and this is
where I get excited,

00:00:39.892 --> 00:00:41.921
flight is about to get
a lot more personal.

00:00:41.945 --> 00:00:44.061
So, a little compare and contrast.

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:46.078
In the last century,

00:00:46.102 --> 00:00:49.704
large commercial airplanes
have connected cities across the globe.

00:00:49.728 --> 00:00:50.895
And 100 years ago,

00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:52.998
it would have been
unthinkable for all of us

00:00:53.022 --> 00:00:55.882
to fly here from around the world
for a five-day conference.

00:00:55.906 --> 00:00:59.104
But we did, and most of us
probably without a second thought.

00:00:59.128 --> 00:01:02.104
And that's a remarkable
achievement for humanity.

00:01:02.636 --> 00:01:06.836
But on a day-to-day basis,
we still spend a lot of time in cars.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.527
Or actively trying to avoid it.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.408
Some of my best friends
live in San Francisco,

00:01:12.432 --> 00:01:15.058
I live in Mountain View,
about 40 miles away.

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:16.755
We're all busy.

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:17.958
At the end of the day,

00:01:17.982 --> 00:01:20.871
we're separated by something like
two hours of heavy traffic.

00:01:20.895 --> 00:01:23.505
So frankly, we haven't seen
each other in a few months.

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:27.452
Now, I work in downtown San Jose,
which is near the airport.

00:01:28.204 --> 00:01:31.847
And there are actually days
when I can leave work,

00:01:31.871 --> 00:01:34.203
get on a plane and fly to Los Angeles

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:36.188
faster than I can drive to San Francisco.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.736
Cities are only getting more populated,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.649
the roads are full, and it's really
difficult to expand them.

00:01:41.673 --> 00:01:43.029
And so in a lot of places,

00:01:43.053 --> 00:01:45.212
there really aren't a lot
of good solutions

00:01:45.236 --> 00:01:46.969
for getting around traffic.

00:01:47.891 --> 00:01:50.351
But what if you could fly over it?

00:01:51.296 --> 00:01:52.804
The sky is underutilized,

00:01:52.828 --> 00:01:55.907
and I would argue it will never be
as congested as the roads are.

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.085
First of all, you've got
a whole other dimension,

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:03.156
but also just safety considerations
and air-traffic management

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.863
will not allow bumper-to-bumper
traffic in the sky.

00:02:05.887 --> 00:02:07.800
Which means, in many cases,

00:02:07.824 --> 00:02:10.871
flying can be a long-term,
compelling alternative

00:02:10.895 --> 00:02:12.695
to traveling on the ground.

00:02:13.474 --> 00:02:14.627
So imagine this:

00:02:14.651 --> 00:02:17.609
you call an Uber, it takes you
to a nearby landing spot --

00:02:17.633 --> 00:02:20.006
we call these vertiports --

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.044
there's an airplane waiting for you there,

00:02:22.068 --> 00:02:24.347
flies you over all
of the traffic in the middle,

00:02:24.371 --> 00:02:27.665
and on the other side, another Uber
takes you to your friend's house.

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:28.840
And I said Uber,

00:02:28.864 --> 00:02:31.950
but I really think we need
to congratulate the Lyft branding team

00:02:31.974 --> 00:02:34.442
for their forward thinking
in choosing their brand.

00:02:34.466 --> 00:02:36.418
(Laughter)

00:02:36.442 --> 00:02:37.688
So in that example,

00:02:37.712 --> 00:02:39.665
OK, there are a few extra steps, I admit.

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:43.014
But it's 30 minutes versus two hours,

00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:44.704
it costs around 60 dollars,

00:02:44.728 --> 00:02:45.995
and you get to fly.

00:02:46.974 --> 00:02:48.149
We're not there yet,

00:02:48.173 --> 00:02:50.490
but we are a lot closer
than you might think.

00:02:50.514 --> 00:02:52.236
So one of the first things we need

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.465
is we need an aircraft that can
take off and land in small spaces

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.530
and quickly take you where you want to go.

00:02:57.554 --> 00:02:59.822
And helicopters can do that today,

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:03.670
but traditionally, helicopters have been
just a little bit too expensive,

00:03:03.694 --> 00:03:05.361
just a little too hard to pilot

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:09.562
and just a little too noisy to be used
for daily transportation in cities.

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:13.419
Well, electric flight and autonomy
are changing that.

00:03:14.228 --> 00:03:15.736
Electric flight, in particular,

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.482
unlocks new possibilities
for vehicle configurations

00:03:18.506 --> 00:03:21.156
that we just could not
explore in the past.

00:03:21.712 --> 00:03:23.037
If you use electric motors,

00:03:23.061 --> 00:03:25.410
you can have many of them
around the aircraft,

00:03:25.434 --> 00:03:27.442
and it doesn't add a lot of extra weight.

00:03:27.466 --> 00:03:29.490
And that gives you redundancy and safety.

00:03:29.514 --> 00:03:31.729
And also, they are cleaner,
cheaper and quieter

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:33.577
than internal combustion engines.

00:03:33.601 --> 00:03:36.529
Autonomy allows the transportation
network to scale,

00:03:36.553 --> 00:03:39.082
and I actually think
it makes the aircraft safer.

00:03:39.561 --> 00:03:42.791
Commercial flights are already automated
for most of their duration,

00:03:42.815 --> 00:03:45.426
and I believe there will come a day

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.908
when we won't even trust an airplane
that required a human to fly.

00:03:50.323 --> 00:03:52.585
So, one of our teams at A3

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.077
wanted to see just how close
this future really was.

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:59.315
So they built and flew a prototype
of one such vehicle.

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:01.022
And they made a point of only using

00:04:01.046 --> 00:04:03.498
mature, commercially available
technologies today.

00:04:04.228 --> 00:04:05.378
We call it Vahana.

00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.292
It's fully electric.

00:04:08.036 --> 00:04:11.920
It takes off and lands vertically,
but flies forward like a regular airplane.

00:04:11.944 --> 00:04:13.928
It's fully self-piloted.

00:04:13.952 --> 00:04:17.126
You push a button, it takes off,
flies and lands, all by itself.

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:19.299
The prototype that you see here

00:04:19.323 --> 00:04:21.776
is designed to carry
a single passenger and luggage.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.818
And it can go about
20 miles in 15 minutes.

00:04:23.842 --> 00:04:28.190
And our estimate for a trip like that
is it would cost around 40 dollars,

00:04:28.214 --> 00:04:30.334
which you can really
build a business around.

00:04:30.358 --> 00:04:32.802
It has multiple redundant
motors and batteries,

00:04:32.826 --> 00:04:36.167
you can lose one, it will continue
flying and land normally.

00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:37.671
It's pretty quiet.

00:04:37.695 --> 00:04:41.196
When it's flying overhead, it will be
quieter than a Prius on the highway.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.918
It's intelligent and has cameras,
lidar and radar,

00:04:43.942 --> 00:04:46.634
so it can detect and avoid
unexpected obstacles.

00:04:47.148 --> 00:04:49.548
And the team really focused
on making it efficient,

00:04:49.572 --> 00:04:53.017
so the batteries are small, light,
and they last longer.

00:04:53.556 --> 00:04:55.994
For reference, the Vahana battery

00:04:56.018 --> 00:04:59.498
is less than half the size
of a Tesla Model S battery.

00:04:59.522 --> 00:05:01.085
It's about 40 kilowatt-hours.

00:05:01.481 --> 00:05:04.275
And you can hot swap the batteries
in just a few minutes.

00:05:05.124 --> 00:05:06.791
And I do think that in a few years,

00:05:06.815 --> 00:05:09.061
people will be comfortable
getting by themselves

00:05:09.085 --> 00:05:13.180
in a self-piloted, electric,
VTOL air taxi.

00:05:13.545 --> 00:05:15.871
But the team is busy
working on the next version,

00:05:15.895 --> 00:05:18.125
which is going to carry
at least two passengers

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:19.545
and fly quite a bit farther.

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:24.141
But more importantly, there are
over 20 companies around the world

00:05:24.165 --> 00:05:26.818
working on vehicles
just like this one right now.

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:30.307
My best guess is in the next five years,

00:05:30.331 --> 00:05:32.783
you'll start seeing
vertiports in some cities,

00:05:32.807 --> 00:05:35.982
and little airplane icons
on your ride-sharing apps.

00:05:36.006 --> 00:05:38.451
And it might begin with a dozen,

00:05:38.475 --> 00:05:40.744
but eventually, we could have
hundreds of these,

00:05:40.768 --> 00:05:41.994
flying around our cities.

00:05:42.018 --> 00:05:45.894
And it will fundamentally transform
our relationship with local travel.

00:05:47.658 --> 00:05:50.727
In the past century,
flight connected our planet,

00:05:50.751 --> 00:05:53.688
in the next, it will reconnect
our local communities,

00:05:53.712 --> 00:05:56.569
and I hope it will
reconnect us to each other.

00:05:56.593 --> 00:05:57.760
Thank you.

00:05:57.784 --> 00:06:04.757
(Applause)

00:06:05.096 --> 00:06:08.032
Chris Anderson: OK, so when
these things first roll out --

00:06:08.056 --> 00:06:11.944
right now, it's a single
person aircraft, right?

00:06:12.293 --> 00:06:13.664
Rodin Lyasoff: Ours is, yes.

00:06:13.688 --> 00:06:14.871
CA: Yours is.

00:06:14.895 --> 00:06:17.141
I mean, someone comes out of their car,

00:06:17.165 --> 00:06:20.369
the door opens, they get in,
there's no one else in there.

00:06:20.837 --> 00:06:22.059
This thing takes off.

00:06:22.496 --> 00:06:23.710
Could we do a poll here?

00:06:23.734 --> 00:06:25.916
Because these are
early adopters in this room.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.179
I want to know who here is excited

00:06:28.203 --> 00:06:32.399
about the idea of being picked up solo
in an auto-flying --

00:06:32.942 --> 00:06:34.101
Well, there you go!

00:06:34.125 --> 00:06:35.324
RL: It's pretty good.

00:06:35.348 --> 00:06:36.688
CA: That is pretty awesome,

00:06:36.712 --> 00:06:39.006
half of TED is completely
stark staring bonkers.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.304
(Laughter)

00:06:42.307 --> 00:06:44.941
RL: So, one of the things
we're really focusing on

00:06:44.965 --> 00:06:46.196
is, really, the cost.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.482
So you can really wrap
a business around that.

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:52.272
And so, that's why some of the features
are really driven by price.

00:06:52.296 --> 00:06:55.685
And the 40-dollar price tag
is really a target that we're aiming for.

00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:59.510
Which should make it accessible
to a larger crowd than this one.

00:06:59.534 --> 00:07:03.112
CA: The biggest blockage
in terms of when this rolls out

00:07:03.136 --> 00:07:06.692
is probably not the technology
at this point -- it's regulation, right?

00:07:06.716 --> 00:07:09.319
RL: That's probably true, yes,
I would agree with that.

00:07:09.343 --> 00:07:12.120
The technology need to mature
in terms of safety,

00:07:12.144 --> 00:07:15.103
to get to the safety levels
that we expect from aircraft.

00:07:16.245 --> 00:07:18.459
But I don't think there are
any blockers there,

00:07:18.483 --> 00:07:19.920
just work needs to get done.

00:07:19.944 --> 00:07:21.682
CA: So, first, this is ride sharing.

00:07:21.706 --> 00:07:23.349
Are we that far away from a time

00:07:23.373 --> 00:07:26.015
when lots of people have
one of these in their garage

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:28.854
and just kind of, go direct
to their friend's house?

00:07:29.381 --> 00:07:32.997
RL: My personal view is that ride sharing
actually allows you to operate

00:07:33.021 --> 00:07:35.069
that entire business
much more efficiently.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.688
You know, there are millennials
that say they never want to own a car.

00:07:40.712 --> 00:07:43.522
I think they'll probably feel
even stronger about aircraft.

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:44.710
So --

00:07:44.734 --> 00:07:46.410
(Laughter)

00:07:46.434 --> 00:07:50.553
I really think that the network
scales and operates a lot better

00:07:50.577 --> 00:07:52.189
as a ride-sharing platform,

00:07:52.213 --> 00:07:55.649
also because the integration
with air-traffic management

00:07:55.673 --> 00:07:58.682
works a lot better
if it's handled centrally.

00:07:58.706 --> 00:08:00.166
CA: Cool. Thank you for that.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.890
RL: Thank you.
CA: That was amazing.
