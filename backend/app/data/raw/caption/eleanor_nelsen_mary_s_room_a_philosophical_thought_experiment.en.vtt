00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:11.149
Imagine a brilliant neuroscientist
named Mary.

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:13.830
Mary lives in a black and white room,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.220
she only reads black and white books,

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.580
and her screens only display 
black and white.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.160
But even though she has never seen color,
Mary is an expert in color vision

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.221
and knows everything ever discovered
about its physics and biology.

00:00:31.221 --> 00:00:33.421
She knows how different 
wavelengths of light

00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:36.842
stimulate three types of cone cells
in the retina,

00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:38.601
and she knows how electrical signals

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:42.821
travel down the optic nerve 
into the brain.

00:00:42.821 --> 00:00:45.232
There, they create patterns 
of neural activity

00:00:45.232 --> 00:00:50.851
that correspond to the millions
of colors most humans can distinguish.

00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:52.192
Now imagine that one day,

00:00:52.192 --> 00:00:54.802
Mary's black and white screen
malfunctions

00:00:54.802 --> 00:00:57.580
and an apple appears in color.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.691
For the first time,

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:03.502
she can experience something
that she's known about for years.

00:01:03.502 --> 00:01:05.211
Does she learn anything new?

00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:10.342
Is there anything about perceiving color
that wasn't captured in all her knowledge?

00:01:10.342 --> 00:01:13.491
Philosopher Frank Jackson proposed
this thought experiment,

00:01:13.491 --> 00:01:17.069
called Mary's room, in 1982.

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:21.312
He argued that if Mary already knew
all the physical facts about color vision,

00:01:21.312 --> 00:01:24.722
and experiencing color still teaches
her something new,

00:01:24.722 --> 00:01:27.462
then mental states, like color perception,

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:31.713
can't be completely described 
by physical facts.

00:01:31.713 --> 00:01:33.492
The Mary's room thought experiment

00:01:33.492 --> 00:01:37.492
describes what philosophers call
the knowledge argument,

00:01:37.492 --> 00:01:40.041
that there are non-physical properties
and knowledge

00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:44.852
which can only be discovered
through conscious experience.

00:01:44.852 --> 00:01:48.024
The knowledge argument contradicts
the theory of physicalism,

00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:50.603
which says that everything, 
including mental states,

00:01:50.603 --> 00:01:53.684
has a physical explanation.

00:01:53.684 --> 00:01:55.813
To most people hearing Mary's story,

00:01:55.813 --> 00:01:59.483
it seems intuitively obvious 
that actually seeing color

00:01:59.483 --> 00:02:03.063
will be totally different 
than learning about it.

00:02:03.063 --> 00:02:06.057
Therefore, there must be some quality
of color vision

00:02:06.057 --> 00:02:09.303
that transcends its physical description.

00:02:09.303 --> 00:02:12.822
The knowledge argument isn't just
about color vision.

00:02:12.822 --> 00:02:18.395
Mary's room uses color vision
to represent conscious experience.

00:02:18.395 --> 00:02:21.713
If physical science can't entirely
explain color vision,

00:02:21.713 --> 00:02:26.844
then maybe it can't entirely explain
other conscious experiences either.

00:02:26.844 --> 00:02:29.304
For instance, we could know every
physical detail

00:02:29.304 --> 00:02:32.724
about the structure and function
of someone else's brain,

00:02:32.724 --> 00:02:37.794
but still not understand
what it feels like to be that person.

00:02:37.794 --> 00:02:42.407
These ineffable experiences 
have properties called qualia,

00:02:42.407 --> 00:02:47.665
subjective qualities that you can't 
accurately describe or measure.

00:02:47.665 --> 00:02:50.469
Qualia are unique to the person
experiencing them,

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:51.714
like having an itch,

00:02:51.714 --> 00:02:52.934
being in love,

00:02:52.934 --> 00:02:54.734
or feeling bored.

00:02:54.734 --> 00:02:58.737
Physical facts can't completely explain
mental states like this.

00:02:58.737 --> 00:03:02.185
Philosophers interested
in artificial intelligence

00:03:02.185 --> 00:03:03.985
have used the knowledge argument

00:03:03.985 --> 00:03:06.715
to theorize that recreating 
a physical state

00:03:06.715 --> 00:03:11.375
won't necessarily recreate
a corresponding mental state.

00:03:11.375 --> 00:03:12.656
In other words,

00:03:12.656 --> 00:03:16.304
building a computer which mimicked 
the function of every single neuron

00:03:16.304 --> 00:03:17.716
of the human brain

00:03:17.716 --> 00:03:22.665
won't necessarily create a conscious
computerized brain.

00:03:22.665 --> 00:03:26.927
Not all philosophers agree that
the Mary's room experiment is useful.

00:03:26.927 --> 00:03:29.836
Some argue that her extensive knowledge
of color vision

00:03:29.836 --> 00:03:32.636
would have allowed her to create
the same mental state

00:03:32.636 --> 00:03:35.446
produced by actually seeing the color.

00:03:35.446 --> 00:03:39.655
The screen malfunction wouldn't
show her anything new.

00:03:39.655 --> 00:03:42.945
Others say that her knowledge
was never complete in the first place

00:03:42.945 --> 00:03:45.816
because it was based only
on those physical facts

00:03:45.816 --> 00:03:48.506
that can be conveyed in words.

00:03:48.506 --> 00:03:50.085
Years after he proposed it,

00:03:50.085 --> 00:03:53.826
Jackson actually reversed his own
stance on his thought experiment.

00:03:53.826 --> 00:03:56.886
He decided that even 
Mary's experience of seeing red

00:03:56.886 --> 00:04:01.726
still does correspond to a measurable
physical event in the brain,

00:04:01.726 --> 00:04:05.557
not unknowable qualia beyond
physical explanation.

00:04:05.557 --> 00:04:07.637
But there still isn't a definitive answer

00:04:07.637 --> 00:04:11.037
to the question of whether Mary would
learn anything new

00:04:11.037 --> 00:04:12.866
when she sees the apple.

00:04:12.866 --> 00:04:15.976
Could it be that there are fundamental
limits to what we can know

00:04:15.976 --> 00:04:18.917
about something we can't experience?

00:04:18.917 --> 00:04:21.948
And would this mean there are certain
aspects of the universe

00:04:21.948 --> 00:04:25.338
that lie permanently beyond
our comprehension?

00:04:25.338 --> 00:04:30.676
Or will science and philosophy allow
us to overcome our mind's limitations?
