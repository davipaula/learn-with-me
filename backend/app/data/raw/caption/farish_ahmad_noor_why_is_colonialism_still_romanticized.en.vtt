00:00:12.835 --> 00:00:16.765
I promise you that I will not sing.
I will spare you that, at least.

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.769
But I am a historian

00:00:20.663 --> 00:00:24.013
with a background in philosophy,

00:00:24.037 --> 00:00:28.868
and my main area of research is basically
the history of Southeast Asia,

00:00:28.892 --> 00:00:33.054
with a focus on 19th-century
colonial Southeast Asia.

00:00:33.078 --> 00:00:34.416
And over the last few years,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.406
what I've been doing is really
tracing the history of certain ideas

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.504
that shape our viewpoint,

00:00:43.528 --> 00:00:45.839
the way we in Asia, in Southeast Asia,

00:00:45.863 --> 00:00:48.787
look at ourselves
and understand ourselves.

00:00:48.811 --> 00:00:54.891
Now, there's one thing
that I cannot explain

00:00:54.915 --> 00:00:56.071
as a historian,

00:00:56.095 --> 00:00:59.663
and this has been puzzling me
for a long time,

00:00:59.687 --> 00:01:06.687
and this is how and why
certain ideas, certain viewpoints

00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:09.999
do not seem to ever go away.

00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:11.975
And I don't know why.

00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:14.118
And in particular,

00:01:14.142 --> 00:01:20.056
I'm interested to understand why
some people -- not all, by no means --

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.795
but some people
in postcolonial Asia

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:32.464
still hold on to a somewhat romanticized
view of the colonial past,

00:01:32.488 --> 00:01:35.144
see it through kind of rose-tinted lenses

00:01:35.168 --> 00:01:40.244
as perhaps a time that was
benevolent or nice or pleasant,

00:01:40.268 --> 00:01:45.674
even though historians know
the realities of the violence

00:01:45.698 --> 00:01:46.894
and the oppression

00:01:46.918 --> 00:01:50.184
and the darker side
of that entire colonial experience.

00:01:50.208 --> 00:01:54.301
So let's imagine that I build
a time machine for myself.

00:01:54.325 --> 00:01:55.420
(Makes beeping noises)

00:01:55.444 --> 00:01:57.905
I build a time machine,

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:59.756
I send myself back to the 1860s,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.290
a hundred years before I was born.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.824
Oh dear, I've just dated myself.

00:02:04.848 --> 00:02:08.212
OK, I go back a hundred years
before I was born.

00:02:08.236 --> 00:02:12.565
Now, if I were to find myself
in the context of colonial Southeast Asia

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:14.054
in the 19th century,

00:02:15.142 --> 00:02:16.560
I would not be a professor.

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:18.911
Historians know this.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.633
And yet, despite that,

00:02:23.253 --> 00:02:27.135
there's still some quarters that somehow
want to hold on to this idea

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.481
that that past was not as murky,

00:02:30.505 --> 00:02:33.873
that there was a romanticized side to it.

00:02:33.897 --> 00:02:35.934
Now, here is where I, as a historian,

00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.604
I encounter the limits of history,

00:02:38.628 --> 00:02:40.905
because I can trace ideas.

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:46.293
I can find out the origins
of certain clichés, certain stereotypes.

00:02:46.317 --> 00:02:50.161
I can tell you who came up with it,
where and when and in which book.

00:02:50.185 --> 00:02:51.815
But there's one thing I cannot do:

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:58.266
I cannot get into the internal,
subjective mental universe of someone

00:02:59.083 --> 00:03:00.496
and change their mind.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.130
And I think this is where and why,
over the last few years,

00:03:05.154 --> 00:03:08.868
I'm increasingly drawn
to things like psychology

00:03:08.892 --> 00:03:10.528
and cognitive behavioral therapy;

00:03:10.552 --> 00:03:15.098
because in these fields,
scholars look at the persistence of ideas.

00:03:15.122 --> 00:03:17.997
Why do some people
have certain prejudices?

00:03:18.021 --> 00:03:21.617
Why are there certain biases,
certain phobias?

00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:27.266
We live, unfortunately, sadly, in a world
where, still, misogyny persists,

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.704
racism persists, all kinds of phobias.

00:03:29.728 --> 00:03:32.542
Islamophobia, for instance, is now a term.

00:03:32.566 --> 00:03:35.258
And why do these ideas persist?

00:03:36.456 --> 00:03:40.088
Many scholars agree that it's partly
because, when looking at the world,

00:03:40.112 --> 00:03:42.511
we fall back, we fall back, we fall back

00:03:42.535 --> 00:03:44.413
on a finite pool,

00:03:44.437 --> 00:03:48.431
a small pool of basic ideas
that don't get challenged.

00:03:48.871 --> 00:03:52.842
Look at how we, particularly us
in Southeast Asia,

00:03:52.866 --> 00:03:56.725
represent ourselves to ourselves
and to the world.

00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:58.261
Look at how often,

00:03:58.285 --> 00:04:02.474
when we talk about ourselves,
my viewpoint, my identity, our identity,

00:04:02.498 --> 00:04:05.664
invariably, we fall back, we fall back,
we fall back, we fall back

00:04:05.688 --> 00:04:07.514
on the same set of ideas,

00:04:07.538 --> 00:04:11.776
all of which have histories of their own.

00:04:12.446 --> 00:04:14.506
Very simple example:

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.015
we live in Southeast Asia,

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.199
which is very popular with tourists
from all over the world.

00:04:19.223 --> 00:04:21.743
And I don't think that's
a bad thing, by the way.

00:04:21.767 --> 00:04:25.070
I think it's good
that tourists come to Southeast Asia,

00:04:25.094 --> 00:04:27.886
because it's part and parcel
of broadening your worldview

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.770
and meeting cultures, etc, etc.

00:04:29.794 --> 00:04:34.527
But look at how we represent ourselves

00:04:34.551 --> 00:04:37.848
through the tourist campaigns,
the tourist ads that we produce.

00:04:37.872 --> 00:04:42.111
There will be the obligatory coconut tree,
banana tree, orangutan.

00:04:42.135 --> 00:04:43.349
(Laughter)

00:04:43.373 --> 00:04:45.334
And the orangutan doesn't even get paid.

00:04:45.358 --> 00:04:46.532
(Laughter)

00:04:47.405 --> 00:04:51.353
Look at how we represent ourselves.
Look at how we represent nature.

00:04:51.377 --> 00:04:53.368
Look at how we represent the countryside.

00:04:53.392 --> 00:04:56.670
Look at how we represent
agricultural life.

00:04:56.694 --> 00:04:58.675
Watch our sitcoms.

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:01.632
Watch our dramas. Watch our movies.

00:05:01.656 --> 00:05:05.266
It's very common,
particularly in Southeast Asia,

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.546
when you watch these sitcoms,

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.812
if there's someone from the countryside,
invariably, they're ugly,

00:05:13.836 --> 00:05:15.848
they're funny, they're silly,

00:05:15.872 --> 00:05:17.415
they're without knowledge.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.486
It's as if the countryside
has nothing to offer.

00:05:22.868 --> 00:05:24.977
Our view of nature,

00:05:25.001 --> 00:05:27.133
despite all our talk,

00:05:27.157 --> 00:05:32.582
despite all our talk about
Asian philosophy, Asian values,

00:05:32.606 --> 00:05:38.302
despite all our talk about how we have
an organic relationship to nature,

00:05:38.326 --> 00:05:41.663
how do we actually treat nature
in Southeast Asia today?

00:05:41.687 --> 00:05:46.839
We regard nature as something
to be defeated and exploited.

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:48.800
And that's the reality.

00:05:49.426 --> 00:05:52.215
So the way in which we live
in our part of the world,

00:05:52.239 --> 00:05:53.805
postcolonial Southeast Asia,

00:05:53.829 --> 00:05:56.278
in so many ways, for me,

00:05:57.364 --> 00:06:03.628
bears residual traces to ideas, tropes,

00:06:03.652 --> 00:06:05.081
clichés, stereotypes

00:06:05.105 --> 00:06:06.706
that have a history.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.600
This idea of the countryside
as a place to be exploited,

00:06:10.624 --> 00:06:14.615
the idea of countryfolk
as being without knowledge --

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.121
these are ideas that historians
like me can go back,

00:06:17.145 --> 00:06:20.423
we can trace how
these stereotypes emerged.

00:06:20.447 --> 00:06:23.222
And they emerged at a time

00:06:24.555 --> 00:06:26.021
when Southeast Asia

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:30.693
was being governed according to
the logic of colonial capitalism.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.717
And in so many ways,

00:06:34.725 --> 00:06:36.275
we've taken these ideas with us.

00:06:36.299 --> 00:06:37.824
They're part of us now.

00:06:37.848 --> 00:06:40.313
But we are not critical

00:06:40.337 --> 00:06:42.917
in interrogating ourselves
and asking ourselves,

00:06:42.941 --> 00:06:45.336
how did I have this view of the world?

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.528
How did I come to have
this view of nature?

00:06:47.552 --> 00:06:50.351
How did I come to have
this view of the countryside?

00:06:50.375 --> 00:06:53.569
How do I have this idea of Asia as exotic?

00:06:53.593 --> 00:06:56.049
And we, Southeast Asians in particular,

00:06:56.073 --> 00:07:00.361
love to self-exoticize ourselves.

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:06.340
We've turned Southeast Asian identity
into a kind of cosplay

00:07:06.364 --> 00:07:10.155
where you can literally
go to the supermarket, go to the mall

00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:14.256
and buy your do-it-yourself
exotic Southeast Asian costume kit.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.478
And we parade this identity,

00:07:16.502 --> 00:07:19.477
not asking ourselves how and when

00:07:19.501 --> 00:07:22.480
did this particular image
of ourselves emerge.

00:07:22.504 --> 00:07:24.080
They all have a history, too.

00:07:25.068 --> 00:07:26.726
And that's why, increasingly,

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.941
as a historian, I find that
as I encounter the limits of history,

00:07:31.965 --> 00:07:35.329
I see that I can't work alone anymore.

00:07:36.436 --> 00:07:38.377
I can't work alone anymore,

00:07:38.401 --> 00:07:43.168
because there's absolutely no point
in me doing my archival work,

00:07:43.192 --> 00:07:47.527
there's no point in me seeking
the roots of these ideas,

00:07:47.551 --> 00:07:49.454
tracing the genesis of ideas

00:07:49.478 --> 00:07:51.316
and then putting it in some journal

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.410
to be read by maybe
three other historians.

00:07:53.434 --> 00:07:54.831
There's absolutely no point.

00:07:55.498 --> 00:08:00.375
The reason why I think this is important
is because our region, Southeast Asia,

00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:03.899
will, I believe, in the years to come,

00:08:03.923 --> 00:08:08.173
go through enormous changes,
unprecedented changes in our history,

00:08:08.197 --> 00:08:09.935
partly because of globalization,

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:13.524
world politics,
geopolitical contestations,

00:08:13.548 --> 00:08:14.996
the impact of technology,

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.806
the Fourth Industrial Revolution ...

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:20.200
Our world as we know it
is going to change.

00:08:20.691 --> 00:08:23.144
But for us to adapt to this change,

00:08:23.168 --> 00:08:25.028
for us to be ready for that change,

00:08:25.052 --> 00:08:27.706
we need to think out of the box,

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:31.168
and we can't fall back,
we can't fall back, we can't fall back

00:08:31.192 --> 00:08:38.177
on the same set of clichéd,
tired, staid old stereotypes.

00:08:38.201 --> 00:08:39.807
We need to think out,

00:08:39.831 --> 00:08:42.605
and that's why historians,
we can't work alone now.

00:08:42.629 --> 00:08:47.160
I, I need to engage
with people in psychology,

00:08:47.184 --> 00:08:49.041
people in behavioral therapy.

00:08:49.065 --> 00:08:52.637
I need to engage with sociologists,
anthropologists, political economists.

00:08:52.661 --> 00:08:55.977
I need above all to engage
with people in the arts

00:08:56.001 --> 00:08:58.152
and the media,

00:08:58.176 --> 00:09:01.049
because it's there, in that forum,

00:09:01.073 --> 00:09:04.450
outside the confines of the university,

00:09:04.474 --> 00:09:07.903
that these debates
really need to take place.

00:09:08.553 --> 00:09:10.719
And they need to take place now,

00:09:11.716 --> 00:09:17.781
because we need to understand
that the way things are today

00:09:17.805 --> 00:09:21.334
are not determined by some fixed,

00:09:22.293 --> 00:09:24.401
iron historical railway track,

00:09:24.425 --> 00:09:26.832
but rather there are many other histories,

00:09:26.856 --> 00:09:31.368
many other ideas that were forgotten,
marginalized, erased along the line.

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:35.594
Historians like me, our job
is to uncover all this, discover all this,

00:09:35.618 --> 00:09:40.497
but we need to engage this,
we need to engage with society as a whole.

00:09:41.088 --> 00:09:45.760
So to go back to that time machine
example I gave earlier.

00:09:46.224 --> 00:09:50.344
Let's say this is a 19th-century
colonial subject then,

00:09:50.368 --> 00:09:51.950
and a person's wondering,

00:09:51.974 --> 00:09:53.762
"Will empire ever come to an end?

00:09:53.786 --> 00:09:55.398
Will there be an end to all this?

00:09:55.422 --> 00:09:57.165
Will we one day be free?"

00:09:57.864 --> 00:09:59.884
So the person invents a time machine --

00:09:59.908 --> 00:10:01.356
(Makes beeping noises)

00:10:02.106 --> 00:10:03.276
goes into the future

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:07.760
and arrives here in postcolonial
Southeast Asia today.

00:10:09.811 --> 00:10:11.695
And the person looks around,

00:10:11.719 --> 00:10:13.095
and the person will see,

00:10:13.119 --> 00:10:14.318
well yes, indeed,

00:10:15.762 --> 00:10:17.671
the imperial flags are gone,

00:10:18.956 --> 00:10:22.000
the imperial gunboats are gone,
the colonial armies are gone.

00:10:22.024 --> 00:10:24.580
There are new flags, new nation-states.

00:10:24.604 --> 00:10:26.582
There is independence after all.

00:10:27.285 --> 00:10:28.703
But has there been?

00:10:29.215 --> 00:10:33.848
The person then watches the tourist ads

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:38.648
and sees again the banana tree,
the coconut tree and the orangutan.

00:10:39.469 --> 00:10:41.175
The person watches on TV

00:10:42.722 --> 00:10:46.538
and watches how images
of an exotic Southeast Asia

00:10:46.562 --> 00:10:50.234
are being reproduced again and again
by Southeast Asians.

00:10:50.258 --> 00:10:53.649
And the person might then
come to the conclusion that, well,

00:10:53.673 --> 00:10:57.279
notwithstanding the fact that

00:10:59.001 --> 00:11:00.488
colonialism is over,

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.476
we are still in so, so many ways

00:11:06.462 --> 00:11:09.568
living in the long shadow
of the 19th century.

00:11:11.128 --> 00:11:15.695
And this, I think, has become
my personal mission.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.122
The reason why I think
history is so important

00:11:19.146 --> 00:11:21.874
and the reason why I think
it's so important for history

00:11:21.898 --> 00:11:23.696
to go beyond history,

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:29.378
because need to reignite this debate
about who and what we are,

00:11:29.402 --> 00:11:30.609
all of us.

00:11:30.633 --> 00:11:33.991
We talk about, "No, I have my viewpoint,
you have your viewpoint."

00:11:34.015 --> 00:11:35.304
Well, that's partly true.

00:11:35.328 --> 00:11:39.224
Our viewpoints are never
entirely our own individually.

00:11:39.248 --> 00:11:41.633
We're all social beings.
We're historical beings.

00:11:41.657 --> 00:11:42.828
You, me, all of us,

00:11:42.852 --> 00:11:44.768
we carry history in us.

00:11:44.792 --> 00:11:47.542
It's in the language we use.
It's in the fiction we write.

00:11:47.566 --> 00:11:49.437
It's in the movies we choose to watch.

00:11:49.461 --> 00:11:52.902
It's in the images that we conjure
when we think of who and what we are.

00:11:52.926 --> 00:11:54.262
We are historical beings.

00:11:54.866 --> 00:11:56.990
We carry history with us,

00:11:57.014 --> 00:11:59.312
and history carries us along.

00:11:59.884 --> 00:12:02.788
But while we are determined by history,

00:12:02.812 --> 00:12:05.296
it is my personal belief

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.548
that we need not be trapped by history,

00:12:08.572 --> 00:12:11.760
and we need not be the victims of history.

00:12:12.744 --> 00:12:13.904
Thank you.

00:12:13.928 --> 00:12:16.052
(Applause)
