00:00:06.914 --> 00:00:11.104
The contents of this metal cylinder could
either revolutionize technology

00:00:11.104 --> 00:00:12.844
or be completely useless—

00:00:12.844 --> 00:00:16.504
it all depends on whether we can harness
the strange physics of matter

00:00:16.504 --> 00:00:18.644
at very, very small scales.

00:00:18.644 --> 00:00:20.954
To have even a chance of doing so,

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:23.434
we have to control the environment 
precisely:

00:00:23.434 --> 00:00:27.114
the thick tabletop and legs guard against
vibrations from footsteps,

00:00:27.114 --> 00:00:30.244
nearby elevators, and opening
or closing doors.

00:00:30.244 --> 00:00:32.384
The cylinder is a vacuum chamber,

00:00:32.384 --> 00:00:34.734
devoid of all the gases in air.

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:37.174
Inside the vacuum chamber is a smaller,

00:00:37.174 --> 00:00:40.824
extremely cold compartment, 
reachable by tiny laser beams.

00:00:40.824 --> 00:00:45.694
Inside are ultra-sensitive particles
that make up a quantum computer.

00:00:45.694 --> 00:00:48.763
So what makes these particles 
worth the effort?

00:00:48.763 --> 00:00:52.913
In theory, quantum computers could 
outstrip the computational limits

00:00:52.913 --> 00:00:54.763
of classical computers.

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:58.833
Classical computers process 
data in the form of bits.

00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:03.263
Each bit can switch between two states 
labeled zero and one.

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:06.371
A quantum computer uses something 
called a qubit,

00:01:06.371 --> 00:01:11.311
which can switch between zero, one, 
and what’s called a superposition.

00:01:11.311 --> 00:01:13.720
While the qubit is in its superposition,

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.950
it has a lot more information 
than one or zero.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.160
You can think of these positions as 
points on a sphere:

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.160
the north and south poles of the sphere 
represent one and zero.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.100
A bit can only switch between 
these two poles,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.660
but when a qubit is in its superposition,

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.780
it can be at any point on the sphere.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.810
We can’t locate it exactly—

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.200
the moment we read it, the qubit resolves 
into a zero or a one.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.869
But even though we can’t observe the 
qubit in its superposition,

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.889
we can manipulate it to perform 
particular operations while in this state.

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:49.379
So as a problem grows more complicated,

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:53.749
a classical computer needs correspondingly
more bits to solve it,

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:57.119
while a quantum computer will 
theoretically be able to handle

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.039
more and more complicated problems

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.479
without requiring as many more qubits as a
classical computer would need bits.

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.009
The unique properties of quantum computers

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.869
result from the behavior of atomic 
and subatomic particles.

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.969
These particles have quantum states,

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:15.779
which correspond to the 
state of the qubit.

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:17.909
Quantum states are incredibly fragile,

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.569
easily destroyed by temperature 
and pressure fluctuations,

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.539
stray electromagnetic fields,

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:26.019
and collisions with nearby particles.

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.819
That’s why quantum computers need 
such an elaborate set up.

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.739
It’s also why, for now,

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.719
the power of quantum computers 
remains largely theoretical.

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:41.759
So far, we can only control a few qubits 
in the same place at the same time.

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:43.728
There are two key components involved

00:02:43.728 --> 00:02:46.898
in managing these fickle quantum 
states effectively:

00:02:46.898 --> 00:02:49.828
the types of particles a quantum 
computer uses,

00:02:49.828 --> 00:02:52.408
and how it manipulates those particles.

00:02:52.408 --> 00:02:55.338
For now, there are two leading approaches:

00:02:55.338 --> 00:02:58.608
trapped ions and superconducting qubits.

00:02:58.608 --> 00:03:03.178
A trapped ion quantum computer uses 
ions as its particles

00:03:03.178 --> 00:03:05.364
and manipulates them with lasers.

00:03:05.364 --> 00:03:09.554
The ions are housed in a trap made 
of electrical fields.

00:03:09.554 --> 00:03:13.034
Inputs from the lasers tell the ions what 
operation to make

00:03:13.034 --> 00:03:16.494
by causing the qubit state 
to rotate on the sphere.

00:03:16.494 --> 00:03:18.354
To use a simplified example,

00:03:18.354 --> 00:03:20.384
the lasers could input the question:

00:03:20.384 --> 00:03:23.244
what are the prime factors of 15?

00:03:23.244 --> 00:03:26.464
In response, the ions may release photons—

00:03:26.464 --> 00:03:30.014
the state of the qubit determines whether
the ion emits photons

00:03:30.014 --> 00:03:32.514
and how many photons it emits.

00:03:32.514 --> 00:03:37.524
An imaging system collects these photons
and processes them to reveal the answer:

00:03:37.524 --> 00:03:39.741
3 and 5.

00:03:39.741 --> 00:03:43.791
Superconducting qubit quantum computers
do the same thing in a different way:

00:03:43.791 --> 00:03:47.671
using a chip with electrical circuits 
instead of an ion trap.

00:03:47.671 --> 00:03:51.761
The states of each electrical circuit 
translate to the state of the qubit.

00:03:51.761 --> 00:03:57.027
They can be manipulated with electrical
inputs in the form of microwaves.

00:03:57.027 --> 00:04:01.089
So: the qubits come from either ions 
or electrical circuits,

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:04.229
acted on by either lasers or microwaves.

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:07.319
Each approach has advantages 
and disadvantages.

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.989
Ions can be manipulated very precisely,

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.959
and they last a long time,

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.009
but as more ions are added to a trap,

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:17.879
it becomes increasingly difficult to 
control each with precision.

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:22.949
We can’t currently contain enough ions 
in a trap to make advanced computations,

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.062
but one possible solution might be to 
connect many smaller traps

00:04:27.062 --> 00:04:29.774
that communicate with each 
other via photons

00:04:29.774 --> 00:04:32.744
rather than trying to create one big trap.

00:04:32.744 --> 00:04:37.924
Superconducting circuits, meanwhile, make
operations much faster than trapped ions,

00:04:37.924 --> 00:04:41.210
and it’s easier to scale up the number 
of circuits in a computer

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.980
than the number of ions.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.190
But the circuits are also more fragile,

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.800
and have a shorter overall lifespan.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.110
And as quantum computers advance,

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.930
they will still be subject to the 
environmental constraints

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.140
needed to preserve quantum states.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.240
But in spite of all these obstacles,

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.710
we’ve already succeeded at making 
computations

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.960
in a realm we can’t enter or even observe.
