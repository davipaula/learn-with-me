00:00:12.927 --> 00:00:14.642
Who do you want to be?

00:00:15.317 --> 00:00:17.295
It's a simple question,

00:00:17.319 --> 00:00:19.071
and whether you know it or not,

00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:22.360
you're answering it every day
through your actions.

00:00:22.971 --> 00:00:27.444
This one question will define
your professional success

00:00:27.468 --> 00:00:29.492
more than any other,

00:00:29.516 --> 00:00:33.497
because how you show up
and treat people means everything.

00:00:34.116 --> 00:00:38.318
Either you lift people up
by respecting them,

00:00:38.342 --> 00:00:42.402
making them feel valued,
appreciated and heard,

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:47.970
or you hold people down
by making them feel small,

00:00:47.994 --> 00:00:51.872
insulted, disregarded or excluded.

00:00:52.314 --> 00:00:55.885
And who you choose to be means everything.

00:00:56.631 --> 00:00:59.604
I study the effects
of incivility on people.

00:00:59.628 --> 00:01:01.313
What is incivility?

00:01:01.337 --> 00:01:03.285
It's disrespect or rudeness.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.982
It includes a lot of different behaviors,

00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:08.360
from mocking or belittling someone

00:01:08.384 --> 00:01:10.923
to teasing people in ways that sting

00:01:10.947 --> 00:01:12.806
to telling offensive jokes

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.639
to texting in meetings.

00:01:14.663 --> 00:01:19.057
And what's uncivil to one person
may be absolutely fine to another.

00:01:19.414 --> 00:01:22.082
Take texting while someone's
speaking to you.

00:01:22.106 --> 00:01:24.268
Some of us may find it rude,

00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:27.147
others may think it's absolutely civil.

00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:28.831
So it really depends.

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:33.908
It's all in the eyes of the beholder
and whether that person felt disrespected.

00:01:34.748 --> 00:01:37.537
We may not mean to make
someone feel that way,

00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:40.498
but when we do, it has consequences.

00:01:41.736 --> 00:01:43.630
Over 22 years ago,

00:01:43.654 --> 00:01:47.162
I vividly recall walking into
this stuffy hospital room.

00:01:47.901 --> 00:01:53.919
It was heartbreaking to see my dad,
this strong, athletic, energetic guy,

00:01:53.943 --> 00:01:57.627
lying in the bed with electrodes
strapped to his bare chest.

00:01:58.548 --> 00:02:01.374
What put him there
was work-related stress.

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:04.051
For over a decade,

00:02:04.075 --> 00:02:07.435
he suffered an uncivil boss.

00:02:09.244 --> 00:02:13.556
And for me, I thought he was
just an outlier at that time.

00:02:14.382 --> 00:02:16.868
But just a couple years later,

00:02:16.892 --> 00:02:19.782
I witnessed and experienced
a lot of incivility

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:21.520
in my first job out of college.

00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:24.862
I spent a year going to work every day

00:02:24.886 --> 00:02:27.227
and hearing things from coworkers like,

00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:30.469
"Are you an idiot?
That's not how it's done,"

00:02:30.493 --> 00:02:33.916
and, "If I wanted your opinion, I'd ask."

00:02:35.025 --> 00:02:37.838
So I did the natural thing.

00:02:37.862 --> 00:02:41.845
I quit, and I went back to grad school
to study the effects of this.

00:02:42.437 --> 00:02:44.701
There, I met Christine Pearson.

00:02:45.218 --> 00:02:48.870
And she had a theory
that small, uncivil actions

00:02:48.894 --> 00:02:51.282
can lead to much bigger problems

00:02:51.306 --> 00:02:53.408
like aggression and violence.

00:02:53.908 --> 00:02:57.896
We believed that incivility affected
performance and the bottom line.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.661
So we launched a study,
and what we found was eye-opening.

00:03:02.383 --> 00:03:05.053
We sent a survey to business school alumni

00:03:05.077 --> 00:03:07.468
working in all different organizations.

00:03:07.492 --> 00:03:09.967
We asked them to write a few sentences

00:03:09.991 --> 00:03:13.005
about one experience
where they were treated rudely,

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:15.619
disrespectfully or insensitively,

00:03:15.643 --> 00:03:18.629
and to answer questions
about how they reacted.

00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:24.393
One person told us about a boss
that made insulting statements like,

00:03:24.417 --> 00:03:26.068
"That's kindergartner's work,"

00:03:26.772 --> 00:03:31.278
and another tore up someone's work
in front of the entire team.

00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:36.156
And what we found is that incivility
made people less motivated:

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.419
66 percent cut back work efforts,

00:03:39.443 --> 00:03:42.462
80 percent lost time
worrying about what happened,

00:03:42.486 --> 00:03:45.482
and 12 percent left their job.

00:03:46.506 --> 00:03:50.177
And after we published these results,
two things happened.

00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:52.892
One, we got calls from organizations.

00:03:53.503 --> 00:03:55.281
Cisco read about these numbers,

00:03:55.305 --> 00:03:59.849
took just a few of these
and estimated, conservatively,

00:03:59.873 --> 00:04:03.112
that incivility was costing them
12 million dollars a year.

00:04:03.961 --> 00:04:08.701
The second thing that happened was,
we heard from others in our academic field

00:04:08.725 --> 00:04:13.369
who said, "Well, people are reporting
this, but how can you really show it?

00:04:13.393 --> 00:04:15.931
Does people's performance really suffer?"

00:04:16.711 --> 00:04:18.593
I was curious about that, too.

00:04:19.046 --> 00:04:23.288
With Amir Erez, I compared
those that experienced incivility

00:04:23.312 --> 00:04:26.088
to those that didn't
experience incivility.

00:04:26.112 --> 00:04:29.791
And what we found is that those
that experience incivility

00:04:29.815 --> 00:04:32.468
do actually function much worse.

00:04:33.571 --> 00:04:35.983
"OK," you may say. "This makes sense.

00:04:36.007 --> 00:04:39.362
After all, it's natural
that their performance suffers."

00:04:40.394 --> 00:04:43.567
But what about if you're not
the one who experiences it?

00:04:44.202 --> 00:04:46.284
What if you just see or hear it?

00:04:46.855 --> 00:04:48.356
You're a witness.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.920
We wondered if it affected witnesses, too.

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:53.080
So we conducted studies

00:04:53.104 --> 00:04:56.701
where five participants would witness
an experimenter act rudely

00:04:56.725 --> 00:04:59.178
to someone who arrived late to the study.

00:04:59.678 --> 00:05:02.382
The experimenter said,
"What is it with you?

00:05:02.406 --> 00:05:04.684
You arrive late, you're irresponsible.

00:05:04.708 --> 00:05:07.944
Look at you! How do you expect
to hold a job in the real world?"

00:05:09.008 --> 00:05:11.269
And in another study in a small group,

00:05:11.293 --> 00:05:14.652
we tested the effects of a peer
insulting a group member.

00:05:15.442 --> 00:05:17.825
Now, what we found was really interesting,

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.517
because witnesses'
performance decreased, too --

00:05:20.541 --> 00:05:24.311
and not just marginally,
quite significantly.

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.025
Incivility is a bug.

00:05:28.576 --> 00:05:30.197
It's contagious,

00:05:30.221 --> 00:05:34.062
and we become carriers of it
just by being around it.

00:05:34.525 --> 00:05:37.112
And this isn't confined to the workplace.

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:39.657
We can catch this virus anywhere --

00:05:39.681 --> 00:05:44.133
at home, online, in schools
and in our communities.

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:49.588
It affects our emotions,
our motivation, our performance

00:05:49.612 --> 00:05:50.975
and how we treat others.

00:05:51.531 --> 00:05:55.314
It even affects our attention
and can take some of our brainpower.

00:05:56.283 --> 00:05:59.859
And this happens not only
if we experience incivility

00:05:59.883 --> 00:06:01.428
or we witness it.

00:06:01.452 --> 00:06:05.267
It can happen even if we
just see or read rude words.

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:08.059
Let me give you an example of what I mean.

00:06:09.424 --> 00:06:12.523
To test this, we gave people
combinations of words

00:06:12.547 --> 00:06:14.028
to use to make a sentence.

00:06:14.591 --> 00:06:16.318
But we were very sneaky.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:22.333
Half the participants got a list
with 15 words used to trigger rudeness:

00:06:22.357 --> 00:06:26.821
impolitely, interrupt, obnoxious, bother.

00:06:27.414 --> 00:06:30.129
Half the participants
received a list of words

00:06:30.153 --> 00:06:32.339
with none of these rude triggers.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.714
And what we found was really surprising,

00:06:35.738 --> 00:06:38.138
because the people who got the rude words

00:06:38.162 --> 00:06:42.473
were five times more likely to miss
information right in front of them

00:06:42.497 --> 00:06:43.854
on the computer screen.

00:06:44.671 --> 00:06:46.741
And as we continued this research,

00:06:46.765 --> 00:06:50.121
what we found is that those
that read the rude words

00:06:50.145 --> 00:06:52.105
took longer to make decisions,

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:53.873
to record their decisions,

00:06:53.897 --> 00:06:56.414
and they made significantly more errors.

00:06:57.263 --> 00:06:58.975
This can be a big deal,

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:02.292
especially when it comes
to life-and-death situations.

00:07:02.887 --> 00:07:06.646
Steve, a physician, told me
about a doctor that he worked with

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:08.396
who was never very respectful,

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.846
especially to junior staff and nurses.

00:07:11.381 --> 00:07:14.784
But Steve told me about
this one particular interaction

00:07:14.808 --> 00:07:17.552
where this doctor shouted
at a medical team.

00:07:18.544 --> 00:07:20.337
Right after the interaction,

00:07:20.361 --> 00:07:23.908
the team gave the wrong dosage
of medication to their patient.

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:29.120
Steve said the information
was right there on the chart,

00:07:29.144 --> 00:07:32.387
but somehow everyone
on the team missed it.

00:07:33.307 --> 00:07:36.960
He said they lacked the attention
or awareness to take it into account.

00:07:37.698 --> 00:07:39.322
Simple mistake, right?

00:07:39.803 --> 00:07:41.304
Well, that patient died.

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:45.640
Researchers in Israel have actually shown

00:07:45.664 --> 00:07:48.149
that medical teams exposed to rudeness

00:07:48.173 --> 00:07:51.606
perform worse not only
in all their diagnostics,

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:53.756
but in all the procedures they did.

00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:57.775
This was mainly because
the teams exposed to rudeness

00:07:57.799 --> 00:08:00.227
didn't share information as readily,

00:08:00.251 --> 00:08:03.104
and they stopped seeking
help from their teammates.

00:08:03.128 --> 00:08:07.010
And I see this not only in medicine
but in all industries.

00:08:08.581 --> 00:08:11.635
So if incivility has such a huge cost,

00:08:11.659 --> 00:08:13.668
why do we still see so much of it?

00:08:14.636 --> 00:08:17.560
I was curious, so we surveyed
people about this, too.

00:08:18.068 --> 00:08:20.934
The number one reason is stress.

00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.669
People feel overwhelmed.

00:08:23.849 --> 00:08:26.528
The other reason that people
are not more civil

00:08:26.552 --> 00:08:29.326
is because they're skeptical
and even concerned

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.980
about being civil or appearing nice.

00:08:32.004 --> 00:08:34.527
They believe they'll appear
less leader-like.

00:08:34.551 --> 00:08:37.487
They wonder: Do nice guys finish last?

00:08:38.042 --> 00:08:40.976
Or in other words: Do jerks get ahead?

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.303
(Laughter)

00:08:43.088 --> 00:08:44.576
It's easy to think so,

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.525
especially when we see
a few prominent examples

00:08:47.549 --> 00:08:49.515
that dominate the conversation.

00:08:50.466 --> 00:08:53.253
Well, it turns out,
in the long run, they don't.

00:08:54.063 --> 00:08:58.039
There's really rich research on this
by Morgan McCall and Michael Lombardo

00:08:58.063 --> 00:09:00.702
when they were at
the Center for Creative Leadership.

00:09:00.726 --> 00:09:05.535
They found that the number one reason
tied to executive failure

00:09:05.559 --> 00:09:09.198
was an insensitive, abrasive
or bullying style.

00:09:10.428 --> 00:09:14.794
There will always be some outliers
that succeed despite their incivility.

00:09:14.818 --> 00:09:16.381
Sooner or later, though,

00:09:16.405 --> 00:09:19.424
most uncivil people
sabotage their success.

00:09:20.217 --> 00:09:22.210
For example, with uncivil executives,

00:09:22.234 --> 00:09:25.282
it comes back to hurt them
when they're in a place of weakness

00:09:25.306 --> 00:09:26.723
or they need something.

00:09:26.747 --> 00:09:28.533
People won't have their backs.

00:09:29.795 --> 00:09:31.716
But what about nice guys?

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.389
Does civility pay?

00:09:33.413 --> 00:09:35.170
Yes, it does.

00:09:35.853 --> 00:09:40.264
And being civil doesn't just mean
that you're not a jerk.

00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:44.152
Not holding someone down
isn't the same as lifting them up.

00:09:44.605 --> 00:09:47.840
Being truly civil means
doing the small things,

00:09:47.864 --> 00:09:50.914
like smiling and saying
hello in the hallway,

00:09:50.938 --> 00:09:53.821
listening fully when
someone's speaking to you.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.291
Now, you can have strong opinions,

00:09:56.315 --> 00:10:01.334
disagree, have conflict
or give negative feedback civilly,

00:10:01.358 --> 00:10:02.846
with respect.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.282
Some people call it "radical candor,"

00:10:05.306 --> 00:10:06.794
where you care personally,

00:10:06.818 --> 00:10:08.589
but you challenge directly.

00:10:09.612 --> 00:10:12.025
So yes, civility pays.

00:10:12.474 --> 00:10:15.369
In a biotechnology firm,
colleagues and I found

00:10:15.393 --> 00:10:17.468
that those that were seen as civil

00:10:17.492 --> 00:10:20.129
were twice as likely
to be viewed as leaders,

00:10:20.153 --> 00:10:22.451
and they performed significantly better.

00:10:23.066 --> 00:10:25.043
Why does civility pay?

00:10:25.067 --> 00:10:29.815
Because people see you
as an important -- and a powerful --

00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:33.542
unique combination
of two key characteristics:

00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:36.641
warm and competent, friendly and smart.

00:10:37.184 --> 00:10:41.684
In other words, being civil
isn't just about motivating others.

00:10:41.708 --> 00:10:42.968
It's about you.

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:47.150
If you're civil, you're more likely
to be seen as a leader.

00:10:47.174 --> 00:10:50.357
You'll perform better, and you're seen
as warm and competent.

00:10:51.722 --> 00:10:55.430
But there's an even bigger story
about how civility pays,

00:10:55.454 --> 00:10:59.472
and it ties to one of the most
important questions around leadership:

00:11:00.234 --> 00:11:03.120
What do people want most
from their leaders?

00:11:03.993 --> 00:11:07.706
We took data from over
20,000 employees around the world,

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:09.735
and we found the answer was simple:

00:11:10.933 --> 00:11:12.145
respect.

00:11:12.711 --> 00:11:15.917
Being treated with respect
was more important

00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:18.437
than recognition and appreciation,

00:11:18.461 --> 00:11:20.016
useful feedback,

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.977
even opportunities for learning.

00:11:22.675 --> 00:11:26.382
Those that felt respected were healthier,

00:11:26.406 --> 00:11:27.781
more focused,

00:11:27.805 --> 00:11:30.311
more likely to stay
with their organization

00:11:30.335 --> 00:11:32.373
and far more engaged.

00:11:34.123 --> 00:11:35.798
So where do you start?

00:11:36.219 --> 00:11:39.739
How can you lift people up
and make people feel respected?

00:11:40.411 --> 00:11:43.478
Well, the nice thing is,
it doesn't require a huge shift.

00:11:43.977 --> 00:11:46.523
Small things can make a big difference.

00:11:47.108 --> 00:11:49.766
I found that thanking people,

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:51.256
sharing credit,

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.012
listening attentively,

00:11:53.663 --> 00:11:56.092
humbly asking questions,

00:11:56.116 --> 00:11:58.831
acknowledging others and smiling

00:11:58.855 --> 00:12:00.243
has an impact.

00:12:01.497 --> 00:12:05.232
Patrick Quinlan, former CEO
of Ochsner Health [System],

00:12:05.256 --> 00:12:08.113
told me about the effects
of their 10-5 way,

00:12:08.137 --> 00:12:10.395
where if you're within 10 feet of someone,

00:12:10.419 --> 00:12:13.069
you make eye contact and smile,

00:12:13.093 --> 00:12:14.765
and if you're within five feet,

00:12:14.789 --> 00:12:16.082
you say hello.

00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:19.381
He explained that civility spread,

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:21.811
patient satisfaction scores rose,

00:12:21.835 --> 00:12:23.731
as did patient referrals.

00:12:24.916 --> 00:12:29.212
Civility and respect can be used
to boost an organization's performance.

00:12:29.808 --> 00:12:35.556
When my friend Doug Conant took over
as CEO of Campbell's Soup Company in 2001,

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.507
the company's market share
had just dropped in half.

00:12:38.531 --> 00:12:40.206
Sales were declining,

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:42.839
lots of people had just been laid off.

00:12:42.863 --> 00:12:46.687
A Gallup manager said it was
the least engaged organization

00:12:46.711 --> 00:12:48.057
that they had surveyed.

00:12:48.969 --> 00:12:51.894
And as Doug drove up
to work his first day,

00:12:51.918 --> 00:12:55.892
he noticed that the headquarters
was surrounded by barbwire fence.

00:12:56.313 --> 00:12:58.894
There were guard towers
in the parking lot.

00:12:59.775 --> 00:13:03.412
He said it looked like
a minimum security prison.

00:13:03.436 --> 00:13:05.247
It felt toxic.

00:13:06.771 --> 00:13:09.721
Within five years, Doug
had turned things around.

00:13:10.182 --> 00:13:13.740
And within nine years, they were setting
all-time performance records

00:13:13.764 --> 00:13:16.719
and racking up awards,
including best place to work.

00:13:17.449 --> 00:13:18.742
How did he do it?

00:13:19.416 --> 00:13:21.843
On day one, Doug told employees

00:13:21.867 --> 00:13:24.534
that he was going to have
high standards for performance,

00:13:24.558 --> 00:13:26.643
but they were going
to do it with civility.

00:13:26.667 --> 00:13:29.893
He walked the talk,
and he expected his leaders to.

00:13:30.805 --> 00:13:35.520
For Doug, it all came down
to being tough-minded on standards

00:13:35.544 --> 00:13:37.428
and tenderhearted with people.

00:13:38.119 --> 00:13:41.332
For him, he said it was all about
these touch points,

00:13:41.356 --> 00:13:44.563
or these daily interactions
he had with employees,

00:13:44.587 --> 00:13:48.517
whether in the hallway,
in the cafeteria or in meetings.

00:13:49.064 --> 00:13:51.742
And if he handled each touch point well,

00:13:51.766 --> 00:13:53.894
he'd make employees feel valued.

00:13:55.089 --> 00:13:58.604
Another way that Doug
made employees feel valued

00:13:58.628 --> 00:14:01.024
and showed them that
he was paying attention

00:14:01.048 --> 00:14:06.411
is that he handwrote over 30,000
thank-you notes to employees.

00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:09.290
And this set an example for other leaders.

00:14:10.456 --> 00:14:14.141
Leaders have about 400
of these touch points a day.

00:14:14.165 --> 00:14:17.513
Most don't take long,
less than two minutes each.

00:14:17.537 --> 00:14:21.844
The key is to be agile and mindful
in each of these moments.

00:14:22.933 --> 00:14:24.663
Civility lifts people.

00:14:25.179 --> 00:14:28.664
We'll get people to give more
and function at their best

00:14:28.688 --> 00:14:29.846
if we're civil.

00:14:30.528 --> 00:14:33.675
Incivility chips away at people
and their performance.

00:14:33.699 --> 00:14:35.960
It robs people of their potential,

00:14:35.984 --> 00:14:38.009
even if they're just working around it.

00:14:39.001 --> 00:14:43.289
What I know from my research is that
when we have more civil environments,

00:14:43.313 --> 00:14:48.769
we're more productive, creative,
helpful, happy and healthy.

00:14:49.428 --> 00:14:50.868
We can do better.

00:14:51.479 --> 00:14:54.487
Each one of us can be more mindful

00:14:54.511 --> 00:14:58.081
and can take actions
to lift others up around us,

00:14:58.105 --> 00:15:01.393
at work, at home, online,

00:15:01.417 --> 00:15:02.581
in schools

00:15:02.605 --> 00:15:04.268
and in our communities.

00:15:04.943 --> 00:15:07.392
In every interaction, think:

00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:09.586
Who do you want to be?

00:15:10.419 --> 00:15:12.932
Let's put an end to incivility bug

00:15:12.956 --> 00:15:14.920
and start spreading civility.

00:15:15.404 --> 00:15:17.647
After all, it pays.

00:15:18.219 --> 00:15:19.384
Thank you.

00:15:19.408 --> 00:15:21.928
(Applause)
