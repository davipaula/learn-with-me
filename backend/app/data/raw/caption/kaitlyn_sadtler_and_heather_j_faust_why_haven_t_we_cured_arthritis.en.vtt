00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:09.450
While regaling you with daring 
stories from her youth,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.364
it might be hard to believe your 
grandmother used to be a trapeze artist.

00:00:13.364 --> 00:00:18.344
However, the bad backs, elbow pain, 
and creaky knees so common in older people

00:00:18.344 --> 00:00:20.497
is more than just “old age."

00:00:20.497 --> 00:00:25.157
In fact, the source of this stiffness 
plagues many young people as well.

00:00:25.157 --> 00:00:26.838
The culprit is arthritis:

00:00:26.838 --> 00:00:29.974
a condition that causes inflammation 
and pain in the joints

00:00:29.974 --> 00:00:33.694
of over 90 million people 
in the U.S. alone.

00:00:33.694 --> 00:00:36.567
But are stiff, creaky joints 
really inevitable?

00:00:36.567 --> 00:00:38.781
What makes arthritis so pervasive,

00:00:38.781 --> 00:00:42.619
and why haven’t we found a cure for 
this widespread condition?

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:45.538
The first hurdle is that arthritis 
is actually a spectrum

00:00:45.538 --> 00:00:48.949
of over 100 different arthritic 
conditions.

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.103
All these conditions share symptoms 
of joint pain and inflammation,

00:00:53.103 --> 00:00:57.120
but the origin and severity of those 
symptoms vary widely.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.812
Even the most common type, 
osteoarthritis,

00:00:59.812 --> 00:01:02.217
is trickier to prevent than 
one might think.

00:01:02.217 --> 00:01:06.242
It’s a general misconception that 
arthritis is confined to old age.

00:01:06.242 --> 00:01:10.640
The origins of osteoarthritis can often 
be traced to a patient’s early life,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.681
from any seemingly ordinary joint injury.

00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:18.211
Following impact, immune cells rush in 
to help clean and repair the damaged site

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:20.001
and begin pumping out enzymes,

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:24.065
including matrix metalloproteinases 
and aggrecanases.

00:01:24.065 --> 00:01:28.221
These enzymes clear out the damaged 
tissue and contribute to inflammation.

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:31.545
But while this rapid swelling helps 
protect the joint during recovery,

00:01:31.545 --> 00:01:36.215
inadequately healed tissue can cause these
immune cells to overstay their welcome.

00:01:36.215 --> 00:01:39.741
The continuing flood of enzymes starts 
to degrade the cartilage,

00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:43.133
weakening the joint and leading 
to arthritis later on.

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:47.813
Not all forms of arthritis can simply 
be traced to an old sports injury.

00:01:47.813 --> 00:01:52.583
Take rheumatoid arthritis, which 
affects 1.3 million U.S. adults.

00:01:52.583 --> 00:01:55.247
This condition is actually an 
autoimmune disease

00:01:55.247 --> 00:01:58.855
in which autoantibodies target 
natively produced proteins,

00:01:58.855 --> 00:02:01.874
some of which are secreted 
by cartilage cells.

00:02:01.874 --> 00:02:04.114
We still don’t know what 
causes this behavior,

00:02:04.114 --> 00:02:08.195
but the result is that the body treats 
joint tissue like a foreign invader.

00:02:08.195 --> 00:02:13.245
Immune cells infiltrate the joint despite 
there being no tissue damage to repair.

00:02:13.245 --> 00:02:15.984
This response leads to chronic 
inflammation,

00:02:15.984 --> 00:02:18.893
which destroys bone and cartilage.

00:02:18.893 --> 00:02:21.648
Yet another condition, 
spondyloarthritis,

00:02:21.648 --> 00:02:24.711
has similarities to both of the 
conditions we’ve covered.

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:27.766
Patients experience continuous 
inflammation in the joints

00:02:27.766 --> 00:02:30.909
and at the sites where ligaments and 
tendons attach to bones,

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.265
even without any initial injury.

00:02:33.265 --> 00:02:37.835
This leads to the flood of enzymes and 
degradation seen in osteoarthritis,

00:02:37.835 --> 00:02:42.027
but is driven by different inflammatory 
proteins called cytokines.

00:02:42.027 --> 00:02:44.363
As the enzymes eat away at cartilage,

00:02:44.363 --> 00:02:48.409
the body attempts to stabilize smaller 
joints by fusing them together.

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.548
This process sometimes leads to 
outgrowths called bone spurs,

00:02:52.548 --> 00:02:56.023
which also cause intense stiffness 
and joint pain.

00:02:56.023 --> 00:02:58.296
With so many factors causing arthritis,

00:02:58.296 --> 00:03:01.405
our current treatments are tailored 
to tackle specific symptoms

00:03:01.405 --> 00:03:03.405
rather than underlying causes.

00:03:03.405 --> 00:03:05.839
These range from promising 
MACI techniques,

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:09.928
which harvest cells from small pieces 
of cartilage to grow replacement tissue.

00:03:09.928 --> 00:03:12.267
To a technique called microfracture,

00:03:12.267 --> 00:03:14.772
where surgeons create small 
holes in the bone,

00:03:14.772 --> 00:03:19.182
allowing bone marrow stem cells to 
leak out and form new cartilage.

00:03:19.182 --> 00:03:20.332
As a last resort,

00:03:20.332 --> 00:03:24.832
people with withered cartilage can 
even undergo full joint replacements.

00:03:24.832 --> 00:03:26.663
But outside these drastic measures,

00:03:26.663 --> 00:03:29.425
the underlying drivers of 
autoimmune arthritis

00:03:29.425 --> 00:03:32.441
still present a unique 
treatment challenge.

00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:36.828
Scientists are making progress with 
therapies that block TNF-alpha,

00:03:36.828 --> 00:03:40.847
one of the primary proteins causing 
inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis.

00:03:40.847 --> 00:03:46.017
But even this approach only treats the 
symptoms of the condition, not the cause.

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:51.509
In the meantime, some of our best defenses
against arthritis are lifestyle choices:

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:54.538
maintaining a healthy weight to 
take pressure off joints,

00:03:54.538 --> 00:03:59.258
low-impact exercises like yoga or cycling,
and avoiding smoking.

00:03:59.258 --> 00:04:03.192
These arthritis-fighting behaviors 
can help us lead longer lives

00:04:03.192 --> 00:04:06.092
as we continue to research 
cures and treatments

00:04:06.092 --> 00:04:09.102
for the huge diversity of 
arthritic conditions.
