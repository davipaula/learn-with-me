00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.453
How does your smartphone
know exactly where you are?

00:00:10.453 --> 00:00:13.756
The answer lies 12,000 miles 
over your head

00:00:13.756 --> 00:00:18.229
in an orbiting satellite that keeps time
to the beat of an atomic clock

00:00:18.229 --> 00:00:21.406
powered by quantum mechanics.

00:00:21.406 --> 00:00:22.436
Phew.

00:00:22.436 --> 00:00:24.425
Let's break that down.

00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:29.121
First of all, why is it so important 
to know what time it is on a satellite

00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:32.149
when location is what
we're concerned about?

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.359
The first thing 
your phone needs to determine

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:37.696
is how far it is from a satellite.

00:00:37.696 --> 00:00:40.883
Each satellite constantly 
broadcasts radio signals

00:00:40.883 --> 00:00:45.762
that travel from space to your phone
at the speed of light.

00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:48.562
Your phone records 
the signal arrival time

00:00:48.562 --> 00:00:51.753
and uses it to calculate 
the distance to the satellite

00:00:51.753 --> 00:00:57.717
using the simple formula,
distance = c x time,

00:00:57.717 --> 00:01:03.085
where c is the speed of light
and time is how long the signal traveled.

00:01:03.085 --> 00:01:04.336
But there's a problem.

00:01:04.336 --> 00:01:06.238
Light is incredibly fast.

00:01:06.238 --> 00:01:09.640
If we were only able to calculate 
time to the nearest second,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.950
every location on Earth, and far beyond,

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.102
would seem to be the same 
distance from the satellite.

00:01:16.102 --> 00:01:20.375
So in order to calculate that distance
to within a few dozen feet,

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:24.168
we need the best clock ever invented.

00:01:24.168 --> 00:01:27.697
Enter atomic clocks,
some of which are so precise

00:01:27.697 --> 00:01:30.563
that they would not gain or lose a second

00:01:30.563 --> 00:01:35.603
even if they ran 
for the next 300 million years.

00:01:35.603 --> 00:01:38.847
Atomic clocks work 
because of quantum physics.

00:01:38.847 --> 00:01:41.808
All clocks must have a constant frequency.

00:01:41.808 --> 00:01:45.371
In other words, a clock must carry out
some repetitive action

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:49.385
to mark off equivalent increments of time.

00:01:49.385 --> 00:01:52.731
Just as a grandfather clock 
relies on the constant swinging

00:01:52.731 --> 00:01:55.847
back and forth of a pendulum 
under gravity,

00:01:55.847 --> 00:01:57.939
the tick tock of an atomic clock

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.041
is maintained by the transition 
between two energy levels of an atom.

00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:06.069
This is where quantum physics 
comes into play.

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.311
Quantum mechanics 
says that atoms carry energy,

00:02:09.311 --> 00:02:13.168
but they can't take on 
just any arbitrary amount.

00:02:13.168 --> 00:02:18.215
Instead, atomic energy 
is constrained to a precise set of levels.

00:02:18.215 --> 00:02:20.300
We call these quanta.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.402
As a simple analogy, 
think about driving a car onto a freeway.

00:02:24.402 --> 00:02:25.730
As you increase your speed,

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.222
you would normally continuously go 
from, say, 20 miles/hour up to 70 miles/hour.

00:02:32.222 --> 00:02:34.792
Now, if you had a quantum atomic car,

00:02:34.792 --> 00:02:37.778
you wouldn't accelerate 
in a linear fashion.

00:02:37.778 --> 00:02:44.495
Instead, you would instantaneously jump,
or transition, from one speed to the next.

00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:48.768
For an atom, when a transition 
occurs from one energy level to another,

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:50.183
quantum mechanics says

00:02:50.183 --> 00:02:54.622
that the energy difference 
is equal to a characteristic frequency,

00:02:54.622 --> 00:02:57.199
multiplied by a constant,

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:02.815
where the change in energy is equal to 
a number, called Planck's constant,

00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:05.092
times the frequency.

00:03:05.092 --> 00:03:10.297
That characteristic frequency 
is what we need to make our clock.

00:03:10.297 --> 00:03:16.311
GPS satellites rely on cesium and rubidium
atoms as frequency standards.

00:03:16.311 --> 00:03:18.651
In the case of cesium 133,

00:03:18.651 --> 00:03:28.846
the characteristic clock frequency
is 9,192,631,770 Hz.

00:03:28.846 --> 00:03:31.636
That's 9 billion cycles per second.

00:03:31.636 --> 00:03:33.625
That's a really fast clock.

00:03:33.625 --> 00:03:36.005
No matter how skilled a clockmaker may be,

00:03:36.005 --> 00:03:38.160
every pendulum, wind-up mechanism

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.760
and quartz crystal resonates 
at a slightly different frequency.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.969
However, every cesium 133 atom 
in the universe

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:50.818
oscillates at the same exact frequency.

00:03:50.818 --> 00:03:53.261
So thanks to the atomic clock,

00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:57.279
we get a time reading accurate
to within 1 billionth of a second,

00:03:57.279 --> 00:04:02.294
and a very precise measurement
of the distance from that satellite.

00:04:02.294 --> 00:04:06.821
Let's ignore the fact that you're almost
definitely on Earth.

00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:10.327
We now know that you're at a fixed 
distance from the satellite.

00:04:10.327 --> 00:04:13.187
In other words, you're somewhere 
on the surface of a sphere

00:04:13.187 --> 00:04:15.950
centered around the satellite.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.137
Measure your distance 
from a second satellite

00:04:18.137 --> 00:04:21.218
and you get another overlapping sphere.

00:04:21.218 --> 00:04:22.186
Keep doing that,

00:04:22.186 --> 00:04:23.793
and with just four measurements,

00:04:23.793 --> 00:04:27.269
and a little correction 
using Einstein's theory of relativity,

00:04:27.269 --> 00:04:33.537
you can pinpoint your location to exactly
one point in space.

00:04:33.537 --> 00:04:34.970
So that's all it takes:

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.770
a multibillion-dollar 
network of satellites,

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.817
oscillating cesium atoms,

00:04:39.817 --> 00:04:41.232
quantum mechanics,

00:04:41.232 --> 00:04:42.327
relativity,

00:04:42.327 --> 00:04:43.484
a smartphone,

00:04:43.484 --> 00:04:45.727
and you.

00:04:45.727 --> 00:04:47.109
No problem.
