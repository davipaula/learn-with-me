00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:14.453
About two years ago,

00:00:14.477 --> 00:00:16.568
I got a phone call that changed my life.

00:00:17.687 --> 00:00:20.549
"Hey, this is your cousin Hassen."

00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:22.668
I froze.

00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:26.207
You see, I have well over
30 first cousins,

00:00:26.231 --> 00:00:28.323
but I didn't know anybody named Hassen.

00:00:29.712 --> 00:00:32.347
It turned out that Hassen
was actually my mom's cousin

00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:34.748
and had just arrived
in Montreal as a refugee.

00:00:35.422 --> 00:00:36.934
And over the next few months,

00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:40.291
I would have three more relatives
coming to Canada to apply for asylum

00:00:40.315 --> 00:00:42.700
with little more than
the clothes on their back.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.669
And in the two years
since that phone call,

00:00:45.693 --> 00:00:47.630
my life has completely changed.

00:00:48.162 --> 00:00:49.388
I left academia

00:00:49.412 --> 00:00:53.838
and now lead a diverse team
of technologists, researchers and refugees

00:00:53.862 --> 00:00:57.646
that is developing customized
self-help resources for newcomers.

00:00:58.418 --> 00:01:02.468
We want to help them overcome
language, cultural and other barriers

00:01:02.492 --> 00:01:06.046
that make them feel like they've lost
control over their own lives.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.234
And we feel that AI can help restore
the rights and the dignity

00:01:09.258 --> 00:01:11.368
that many people lose when seeking help.

00:01:12.559 --> 00:01:15.455
My family's refugee experience
is not unique.

00:01:16.384 --> 00:01:18.155
According to the UNHCR,

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:21.249
every minute, 20 people
are newly displaced

00:01:21.273 --> 00:01:23.653
by climate change, economic crisis

00:01:23.677 --> 00:01:25.743
and social and political instability.

00:01:26.441 --> 00:01:29.233
And it was while volunteering
at a local YMCA shelter

00:01:29.257 --> 00:01:32.227
that my cousin Hassen
and other relatives were sent to

00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:34.565
that we saw and learned to appreciate

00:01:34.589 --> 00:01:38.676
how much effort and coordination
resettlement requires.

00:01:39.042 --> 00:01:42.522
When you first arrive,
you need to find a lawyer

00:01:42.546 --> 00:01:45.028
and fill out legal documents
within two weeks.

00:01:45.052 --> 00:01:49.084
You also need to schedule a medical exam
with a pre-authorized physician,

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:51.651
just so that you can apply
for a work permit.

00:01:51.675 --> 00:01:54.078
And you need to start looking
for a place to live

00:01:54.102 --> 00:01:56.970
before you receive
any sort of social assistance.

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.833
With thousands fleeing the United States

00:02:00.857 --> 00:02:03.196
to seek asylum in Canada
over the past few years,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.863
we quickly saw what it looks like

00:02:04.887 --> 00:02:08.980
when there are more people who need help
than there are resources to help them.

00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:11.367
Social services doesn't scale quickly,

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.519
and even if communities do their best

00:02:14.543 --> 00:02:17.288
to help more people
with limited resources,

00:02:17.312 --> 00:02:19.939
newcomers end up spending
more time waiting in limbo,

00:02:19.963 --> 00:02:21.566
not knowing where to turn.

00:02:22.457 --> 00:02:23.912
In Montreal, for example,

00:02:23.936 --> 00:02:27.644
despite millions of dollars being spent
to support resettlement efforts,

00:02:27.668 --> 00:02:30.200
nearly 50 percent of newcomers
still don't know

00:02:30.224 --> 00:02:32.526
that there are free resources that exist

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.143
to help them with everything
from filling out paperwork

00:02:35.167 --> 00:02:36.477
to finding a job.

00:02:37.292 --> 00:02:40.347
The challenge is not
that this information doesn't exist.

00:02:41.064 --> 00:02:45.464
On the contrary, those in need are often
bombarded with so much information

00:02:45.488 --> 00:02:47.665
that it's difficult
to make sense of it all.

00:02:48.957 --> 00:02:52.501
"Don't give me more information,
just tell me what to do,"

00:02:52.525 --> 00:02:55.711
was a sentiment we heard
over and over again.

00:02:55.735 --> 00:02:59.440
And it reflects how insanely difficult
it could be to get your bearings

00:02:59.464 --> 00:03:01.705
when you first arrive in a new country.

00:03:02.603 --> 00:03:06.355
Hell, I struggled with the same issues
when I got to Montreal,

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:07.805
and I have a PhD.

00:03:08.234 --> 00:03:09.601
(Laughter)

00:03:10.068 --> 00:03:12.973
As another member of our team,
himself also a refugee, put it:

00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:17.279
"In Canada, a SIM card
is more important than food,

00:03:17.303 --> 00:03:19.292
because we will not die from hunger."

00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:23.291
But getting access to the right
resources and information

00:03:23.315 --> 00:03:26.571
can be the difference
between life and death.

00:03:27.465 --> 00:03:28.894
Let me say that again:

00:03:28.918 --> 00:03:32.049
getting access to the right
resources and information

00:03:32.073 --> 00:03:35.967
can be the difference
between life and death.

00:03:37.347 --> 00:03:38.958
In order to address these issues,

00:03:38.982 --> 00:03:40.668
we built Atar,

00:03:40.692 --> 00:03:43.602
the first-ever AI-powered virtual advocate

00:03:43.626 --> 00:03:46.240
that guides you step-by-step
through your first week

00:03:46.264 --> 00:03:47.754
of arriving in a new city.

00:03:47.778 --> 00:03:49.781
Just tell Atar what you need help with.

00:03:50.747 --> 00:03:52.835
Atar will then ask you
some basic questions

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.903
to understand your unique circumstances

00:03:54.927 --> 00:03:57.823
and determine your eligibility
for resources.

00:03:57.847 --> 00:04:00.654
For example: Do you have
a place to stay tonight?

00:04:01.845 --> 00:04:04.498
If not, would you prefer
an all-women's shelter?

00:04:05.232 --> 00:04:06.623
Do you have children?

00:04:07.442 --> 00:04:10.584
Atar will then generate
a custom, step-by-step to-do list

00:04:10.608 --> 00:04:12.897
that tells you everything
that you need to know,

00:04:12.921 --> 00:04:15.646
from where to go, how to get there,

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:16.872
what to bring with you

00:04:16.896 --> 00:04:18.122
and what to expect.

00:04:18.924 --> 00:04:21.311
You can ask a question at any time,

00:04:21.335 --> 00:04:23.028
and if Atar doesn't have an answer,

00:04:23.052 --> 00:04:25.721
you'll be connected
with a real person who does.

00:04:26.775 --> 00:04:28.323
But what's most exciting

00:04:29.077 --> 00:04:32.152
is that we help humanitarian
and service organizations

00:04:32.176 --> 00:04:36.211
collect the data and the analytics
that's necessary to understand

00:04:36.235 --> 00:04:37.856
the changing needs of newcomers

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.315
in real time.

00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:41.338
That's a game changer.

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:44.321
We've already partnered with the UNHCR

00:04:44.345 --> 00:04:46.215
to provide this technology in Canada,

00:04:46.239 --> 00:04:50.048
and in our work have conducted
campaigns in Arabic, English,

00:04:50.072 --> 00:04:52.553
French, Creole and Spanish.

00:04:54.246 --> 00:04:57.177
When we talk about the issue of refugees,

00:04:57.201 --> 00:04:59.218
we often focus on the official statistic

00:04:59.242 --> 00:05:03.100
of 65.8 million forcibly
displaced worldwide.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.429
But the reality is much greater than that.

00:05:07.193 --> 00:05:12.351
By 2050, there will be
an additional 140 million people

00:05:12.375 --> 00:05:15.797
who are at risk of being displaced
due to environmental degradation.

00:05:16.412 --> 00:05:21.200
And today -- that is today --
there are nearly one billion people

00:05:21.224 --> 00:05:24.234
who already live in illegal
settlements and slums.

00:05:25.356 --> 00:05:27.300
Resettlement and integration

00:05:27.324 --> 00:05:29.953
is one of the greatest
challenges of our time.

00:05:30.883 --> 00:05:35.077
and our hope is that Atar can provide
every single newcomer an advocate.

00:05:36.212 --> 00:05:39.629
Our hope is that Atar
can amplify existing efforts

00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:43.165
and alleviate pressure
on a social safety net

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:45.772
that's already stretched
beyond imagination.

00:05:47.183 --> 00:05:49.629
But what's most important to us

00:05:49.653 --> 00:05:54.257
is that our work helps restore
the rights and the dignity

00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:57.832
that refugees lose throughout
resettlement and integration

00:05:57.856 --> 00:06:02.173
by giving them the resources that
they need in order to help themselves.

00:06:02.197 --> 00:06:03.429
Thank you.

00:06:03.453 --> 00:06:06.037
(Applause)
