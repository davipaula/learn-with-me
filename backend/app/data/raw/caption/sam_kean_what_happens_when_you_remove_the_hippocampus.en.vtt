00:00:06.688 --> 00:00:09.604
On September 1st, 1953,

00:00:09.604 --> 00:00:13.240
William Scoville used a hand crank
and a cheap drill saw

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.946
to bore into a young man's skull,
cutting away vital pieces of his brain

00:00:17.946 --> 00:00:20.806
and sucking them out through a metal tube.

00:00:20.806 --> 00:00:25.111
But this wasn't a scene from a horror film
or a gruesome police report.

00:00:25.111 --> 00:00:29.811
Dr. Scoville was one of the most 
renowned neurosurgeons of his time,

00:00:29.811 --> 00:00:35.114
and the young man was Henry Molaison,
the famous patient known as "H.M.",

00:00:35.114 --> 00:00:40.466
whose case provided amazing insights
into how our brains work.

00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:43.866
As a boy, Henry had cracked 
his skull in an accident

00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:49.610
and soon began having seizures, blacking out
and losing control of bodily functions.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.901
After enduring years of frequent episodes,
and even dropping out of high school,

00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:57.009
the desperate young man 
had turned to Dr. Scoville,

00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:00.202
a daredevil known for risky surgeries.

00:01:00.202 --> 00:01:04.259
Partial lobotomies had been used
for decades to treat mental patients

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.793
based on the notion that
mental functions were strictly localized

00:01:07.793 --> 00:01:10.588
to corresponding brain areas.

00:01:10.588 --> 00:01:14.162
Having successfully used them
to reduce seizures in psychotics,

00:01:14.162 --> 00:01:17.378
Scoville decided to remove 
H.M.'s hippocampus,

00:01:17.378 --> 00:01:21.142
a part of the limbic system
that was associated with emotion

00:01:21.142 --> 00:01:23.781
but whose function was unknown.

00:01:23.781 --> 00:01:26.352
At first glance, 
the operation had succeeded.

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:30.593
H.M.'s seizures virtually disappeared,
with no change in personality,

00:01:30.593 --> 00:01:32.854
and his IQ even improved.

00:01:32.854 --> 00:01:36.616
But there was one problem: 
His memory was shot.

00:01:36.616 --> 00:01:39.907
Besides losing most of his memories
from the previous decade,

00:01:39.907 --> 00:01:43.290
H.M. was unable to form new ones,
forgetting what day it was,

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.111
repeating comments,
and even eating multiple meals in a row.

00:01:48.111 --> 00:01:52.333
When Scoville informed another expert,
Wilder Penfield, of the results,

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:57.918
he sent a Ph.D student named Brenda Milner
to study H.M. at his parents' home,

00:01:57.918 --> 00:02:00.464
where he now spent his days
doing odd chores,

00:02:00.464 --> 00:02:04.607
and watching classic movies
for the first time, over and over.

00:02:04.607 --> 00:02:07.402
What she discovered through
a series of tests and interviews

00:02:07.402 --> 00:02:10.608
didn't just contribute greatly
to the study of memory.

00:02:10.608 --> 00:02:13.751
It redefined what memory even meant.

00:02:13.751 --> 00:02:16.692
One of Milner's findings shed light
on the obvious fact

00:02:16.692 --> 00:02:21.577
that although H.M. couldn't form new memories,
he still retained information

00:02:21.577 --> 00:02:26.185
long enough from moment to moment
to finish a sentence or find the bathroom.

00:02:26.185 --> 00:02:28.358
When Milner gave him a random number,

00:02:28.358 --> 00:02:31.123
he managed to remember it 
for fifteen minutes

00:02:31.123 --> 00:02:33.474
by repeating it to himself constantly.

00:02:33.474 --> 00:02:38.064
But only five minutes later,
he forgot the test had even taken place.

00:02:38.064 --> 00:02:41.812
Neuroscientists had though of memory
as monolithic,

00:02:41.812 --> 00:02:45.800
all of it essentially the same
and stored throughout the brain.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.868
Milner's results were not only the first
clue for the now familiar distinction

00:02:49.868 --> 00:02:52.536
between short-term and long-term memory,

00:02:52.536 --> 00:02:56.125
but show that each uses 
different brain regions.

00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:59.369
We now know that memory formation
involves several steps.

00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:04.834
After immediate sensory data is temporarily
transcribed by neurons in the cortex,

00:03:04.834 --> 00:03:06.742
it travels to the hippocampus,

00:03:06.742 --> 00:03:12.066
where special proteins work to strengthen 
the cortical synaptic connections.

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:13.749
If the experience was strong enough,

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:16.682
or we recall it periodically
in the first few days,

00:03:16.682 --> 00:03:22.147
the hippocampus then transfers the memory
back to the cortex for permanent storage.

00:03:22.147 --> 00:03:25.371
H.M.'s mind could form
the initial impressions,

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:29.325
but without a hippocampus
to perform this memory consolidation,

00:03:29.325 --> 00:03:33.361
they eroded, 
like messages scrawled in sand.

00:03:33.361 --> 00:03:36.565
But this was not the 
only memory distinction Milner found.

00:03:36.565 --> 00:03:41.194
In a now famous experiment,
she asked H.M. to trace a third star

00:03:41.194 --> 00:03:45.753
in the narrow space between 
the outlines of two concentric ones

00:03:45.753 --> 00:03:49.373
while he could only see
his paper and pencil through a mirror.

00:03:49.373 --> 00:03:52.490
Like anyone else performing such 
an awkward task for the first time,

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.297
he did horribly.

00:03:54.297 --> 00:03:57.685
But surprisingly, he improved over 
repeated trials,

00:03:57.685 --> 00:04:01.151
even though he had no memory
of previous attempts.

00:04:01.151 --> 00:04:06.644
His unconscious motor centers remembered
what the conscious mind had forgotten.

00:04:06.644 --> 00:04:11.690
What Milner had discovered was that the
declarative memory of names, dates and facts

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.256
is different from the procedural memory
of riding a bicycle or signing your name.

00:04:17.256 --> 00:04:19.500
And we now know that procedural memory

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.852
relies more on the basal ganglia 
and cerebellum,

00:04:22.852 --> 00:04:26.117
structures that were intact in H.M.'s brain.

00:04:26.117 --> 00:04:29.556
This distinction between "knowing that"
and "knowing how"

00:04:29.556 --> 00:04:32.960
has underpinned all memory research since.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.152
H.M. died at the age of 82 after
a mostly peaceful life in a nursing home.

00:04:38.152 --> 00:04:42.556
Over the years, he had been examined
by more than 100 neuroscientists,

00:04:42.556 --> 00:04:45.750
making his the most 
studied mind in history.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.915
Upon his death, his brain was
preserved and scanned

00:04:48.915 --> 00:04:52.356
before being cut into over 2000
individual slices

00:04:52.356 --> 00:04:57.624
and photographed to form a digital map
down to the level of individual neurons,

00:04:57.624 --> 00:05:02.017
all in a live broadcast
watched by 400,000 people.

00:05:02.017 --> 00:05:04.684
Though H.M. spent most of his life
forgetting things,

00:05:04.684 --> 00:05:07.602
he and his contributions
to our understanding of memory

00:05:07.602 --> 00:05:10.013
will be remembered for 
generations to come.
