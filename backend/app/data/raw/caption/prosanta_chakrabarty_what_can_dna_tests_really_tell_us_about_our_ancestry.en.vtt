00:00:07.013 --> 00:00:11.187
Two sisters take the same DNA test.

00:00:11.187 --> 00:00:17.994
The results show that one sister 
is 10% French, the other 0%.

00:00:17.994 --> 00:00:20.724
Both sisters share the same two parents,

00:00:20.724 --> 00:00:23.284
and therefore the same set 
of ancestors.

00:00:23.284 --> 00:00:28.574
So how can one be 10% more French 
than the other?

00:00:28.574 --> 00:00:34.178
Tests like these rely on our DNA 
to answer questions about our ancestry,

00:00:34.178 --> 00:00:37.418
but our DNA actually 
can’t tell us everything

00:00:37.418 --> 00:00:41.760
about who we are or where we’re from.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.160
DNA tests are great 
at answering some questions,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.428
like who your parents are, but 
can provide baffling results to others,

00:00:50.428 --> 00:00:54.442
like whether you have ancestors 
from a particular region.

00:00:54.442 --> 00:01:00.673
To understand why, it helps to know where
our DNA comes from in the first place.

00:01:00.673 --> 00:01:05.865
Each person’s DNA consists 
of about 6 billion base pairs

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:11.025
stored in 23 pairs of chromosomes—
46 total.

00:01:11.025 --> 00:01:14.365
That may seem like a dizzying amount 
of information,

00:01:14.365 --> 00:01:19.207
but 99% of our genome 
is shared among all humans.

00:01:19.207 --> 00:01:26.675
The remaining 1% contains everything
distinct about an individual’s ancestry.

00:01:26.675 --> 00:01:34.036
Commercial DNA tests utilize 
less than 1% of that 1%.

00:01:34.036 --> 00:01:38.588
One chromosome in each pair 
comes from each parent.

00:01:38.588 --> 00:01:42.963
These halves join at conception: 
when a sperm and egg,

00:01:42.963 --> 00:01:46.713
each with only 23 chromosomes, 
combine.

00:01:46.713 --> 00:01:51.733
The story of our ancestry becomes
muddled before conception.

00:01:51.733 --> 00:01:56.028
That’s because the 23 chromosomes 
in a sperm or egg

00:01:56.028 --> 00:02:01.344
aren’t identical to the chromosomes 
of every other cell in the body.

00:02:01.344 --> 00:02:06.576
As they go from a cell with 46 
chromosomes to a sex cell with only 23,

00:02:06.576 --> 00:02:11.463
the chromosomes within each pair 
swap some sections.

00:02:11.463 --> 00:02:17.975
This process is called recombination, 
and it means that every sperm or egg

00:02:17.975 --> 00:02:23.662
contains single chromosomes 
that are a unique mash up of each pair.

00:02:23.662 --> 00:02:28.327
Recombination occurs uniquely 
in each sex cell—

00:02:28.327 --> 00:02:33.045
making two sisters’ chromosomes different
not only from their parents’,

00:02:33.045 --> 00:02:35.285
but from each other’s.

00:02:35.285 --> 00:02:39.105
Recombination happens before conception,

00:02:39.105 --> 00:02:44.123
so you get exactly half of your DNA 
from each parent,

00:02:44.123 --> 00:02:48.464
but going further back 
things get more complicated.

00:02:48.464 --> 00:02:53.216
Without recombination, you would get 
1/4 from each grandparent,

00:02:53.216 --> 00:02:57.399
1/8 from each great-grandparent, 
and so on,

00:02:57.399 --> 00:03:02.861
but because recombination happens 
every generation, those numbers vary.

00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:06.481
The more generations removed 
an ancestor is,

00:03:06.481 --> 00:03:11.618
the more likely they won’t be represented
in your DNA at all.

00:03:11.618 --> 00:03:14.548
For example, without recombination,

00:03:14.548 --> 00:03:22.216
just 1/64 of your DNA would come 
from each ancestor six generations back.

00:03:22.216 --> 00:03:25.696
Because of recombination, 
that number can be higher,

00:03:25.696 --> 00:03:32.367
though we don’t know for sure how high—
or it can as low as 0.

00:03:32.367 --> 00:03:34.977
So one sister isn’t more French

00:03:34.977 --> 00:03:38.517
in the sense of having more 
ancestors from France.

00:03:38.517 --> 00:03:45.390
Instead, the French ancestors are simply
more represented in her DNA.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.260
But the story doesn’t end there.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.327
Tests don’t trace the DNA 
of the sisters' actual French ancestors—

00:03:53.327 --> 00:03:57.067
we don’t have access to the genomes 
of deceased individuals

00:03:57.067 --> 00:03:59.799
from previous generations.

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.249
Instead, these results 
are based on a comparison

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:07.915
to the DNA of people 
living in France today.

00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:13.837
The tests look for genetic markers, 
or combinations of genetic markers.

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:19.216
These markers are short sequences 
that appear in specific places.

00:04:19.216 --> 00:04:23.812
The sister deemed "more French" 
shares genetic markers

00:04:23.812 --> 00:04:26.932
with people currently living in France.

00:04:26.932 --> 00:04:31.408
The assumption is that these 
shared markers indicate ancestors

00:04:31.408 --> 00:04:34.588
from the same place: France.

00:04:34.588 --> 00:04:38.678
It’s important to note that results 
are based on people

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:40.698
who’ve had their genomes sequenced—

00:04:40.698 --> 00:04:45.032
80-90% of which are of European descent.

00:04:45.032 --> 00:04:49.745
Many indigenous peoples 
are barely represented, if at all.

00:04:49.745 --> 00:04:55.453
The test won’t reveal heritage from people
not represented in the database,

00:04:55.453 --> 00:05:00.198
and shouldn’t be used to prove 
race or ethnicity.

00:05:00.198 --> 00:05:05.232
And as more people get sequenced, 
your results might change.

00:05:05.232 --> 00:05:10.843
Looking further back, you may get a result
like 2% Neanderthal.

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:14.494
Though Neanderthals were a separate 
species from humans,

00:05:14.494 --> 00:05:21.444
that 2% doesn’t come out of the 99% 
of our genome shared among all humans,

00:05:21.444 --> 00:05:24.194
but the 1% that varies.

00:05:24.194 --> 00:05:27.874
That’s because about 40,000 years ago,

00:05:27.874 --> 00:05:31.602
certain human populations 
interbred with Neanderthals,

00:05:31.602 --> 00:05:36.222
meaning some people alive today 
have Neanderthal ancestors.

00:05:36.222 --> 00:05:40.084
Many Neanderthal ancestors, in fact:

00:05:40.084 --> 00:05:43.404
there are so many generations 
in 40,000 years

00:05:43.404 --> 00:05:48.883
that a single Neanderthal’s genetic 
contribution would be untraceable.

00:05:48.883 --> 00:05:53.868
You can be both 100% French 
and 2% Neanderthal—

00:05:53.868 --> 00:05:58.535
though both come from the 1% 
of DNA that makes us different,

00:05:58.535 --> 00:06:02.375
they’re accounting for different things.

00:06:02.375 --> 00:06:09.129
Looking for traces of our ancestry 
in our DNA gets complicated very quickly.

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:13.914
Both the way we inherit DNA 
and the information available for testing

00:06:13.914 --> 00:06:19.794
makes it difficult to say certain things
with 100% certainty.
