00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.520
[Why don't we eat bugs?]

00:00:09.416 --> 00:00:12.124
For centuries, people have consumed bugs,

00:00:12.148 --> 00:00:13.473
everything from beetles

00:00:13.497 --> 00:00:15.351
to caterpillars, locusts,

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:18.304
grasshoppers, termites, and dragonflies.

00:00:18.328 --> 00:00:20.449
The practice even has a name:

00:00:20.473 --> 00:00:21.488
entomophagy.

00:00:21.512 --> 00:00:24.257
Early hunter-gatherers
probably learned from animals

00:00:24.281 --> 00:00:27.370
that foraged for protein-rich insects
and followed suit.

00:00:28.147 --> 00:00:31.507
As we evolved and bugs
became part of our dietary tradition,

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:35.368
they fulfilled the role
of both staple food and delicacy.

00:00:35.392 --> 00:00:39.250
In ancient Greece, cicadas
were considered luxury snacks.

00:00:39.274 --> 00:00:43.016
And even the Romans found
beetle larvae to be scrumptious.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.125
Why have we lost our taste for bugs?

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.971
The reason for our rejection
is historical,

00:00:47.995 --> 00:00:49.541
and the story probably begins

00:00:49.565 --> 00:00:52.773
around 10,000 BC in the Fertile Crescent,

00:00:52.797 --> 00:00:54.248
a place in the Middle East

00:00:54.272 --> 00:00:56.757
that was a major birthplace
of agriculture.

00:00:56.781 --> 00:01:01.333
Back then, our once-nomadic ancestors
began to settle in the Crescent.

00:01:01.357 --> 00:01:04.646
And as they learned to farm crops
and domesticate animals there,

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.084
attitudes changed,

00:01:06.108 --> 00:01:09.530
rippling outwards towards Europe
and the rest of the Western world.

00:01:09.554 --> 00:01:10.839
As farming took off,

00:01:10.863 --> 00:01:13.940
people might have spurned
bugs as mere pests

00:01:13.964 --> 00:01:15.508
that destroyed their crops.

00:01:15.532 --> 00:01:18.367
Populations grew,
and the West became urbanized,

00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:21.168
weakening connections
with our foraging past.

00:01:21.192 --> 00:01:23.627
People simply forgot
their bug-rich history.

00:01:24.015 --> 00:01:26.663
Today, for people not
accustomed to entomophagy,

00:01:26.687 --> 00:01:28.256
bugs are just an irritant.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.216
They sting and bite and infest our food.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.692
We feel an "ick factor"
associated with them

00:01:33.716 --> 00:01:37.118
and are disgusted
by the prospect of cooking insects.

00:01:37.142 --> 00:01:40.441
Almost 2,000 insect species
are turned into food,

00:01:40.465 --> 00:01:42.542
forming a big part of everyday diets

00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:45.334
for two billion people around the world.

00:01:45.358 --> 00:01:48.386
Countries in the tropics
are the keenest consumers,

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.387
because culturally, it's acceptable.

00:01:50.411 --> 00:01:53.318
Species in those regions
are also large, diverse,

00:01:53.342 --> 00:01:55.904
and tend to congregate in groups or swarms

00:01:55.928 --> 00:01:57.870
that make them easy to harvest.

00:01:58.124 --> 00:01:59.855
Take Cambodia in Southeast Asia

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:02.320
where huge tarantulas are gathered,

00:02:02.344 --> 00:02:04.438
fried, and sold in the marketplace.

00:02:04.462 --> 00:02:05.477
In southern Africa,

00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:08.642
the juicy mopane worm is a dietary staple,

00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:10.056
simmered in a spicy sauce

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.554
or eaten dried and salted.

00:02:12.578 --> 00:02:17.229
And in Mexico, chopped jumiles
are toasted with garlic, lemon, and salt.

00:02:17.253 --> 00:02:19.630
Bugs can be eaten whole to make up a meal

00:02:19.654 --> 00:02:23.288
or ground into flour, powder,
and paste to add to food.

00:02:23.312 --> 00:02:25.153
But it's not all about taste.

00:02:25.177 --> 00:02:26.419
They're also healthy.

00:02:26.443 --> 00:02:30.657
In fact, scientists say entomophagy
could be a cost-effective solution

00:02:30.681 --> 00:02:33.503
for developing countries
that are food insecure.

00:02:33.527 --> 00:02:36.466
Insects can contain up to 80% protein,

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.313
the body's vital building blocks,

00:02:38.337 --> 00:02:40.856
and are also high in energy-rich fat,

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.264
fiber, and micronutrients
like vitamins and minerals.

00:02:44.288 --> 00:02:47.228
Did you know that most edible insects
contain the same amount

00:02:47.252 --> 00:02:50.223
or even more mineral iron than beef,

00:02:50.247 --> 00:02:54.670
making them a huge, untapped resource
when you consider that iron deficiency

00:02:54.694 --> 00:02:58.398
is currently the most common
nutritional problem in the world?

00:02:58.422 --> 00:03:00.555
The mealworm
is another nutritious example.

00:03:01.492 --> 00:03:05.390
The yellow beetle larvae are native
to America and easy to farm.

00:03:06.362 --> 00:03:07.983
They have a high vitamin content,

00:03:08.007 --> 00:03:09.246
loads of healthy minerals,

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.977
and can contain up to 50% protein,

00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:15.230
almost as much as in an equivalent
amount of beef.

00:03:15.254 --> 00:03:17.822
To cook, simply sautÃ© in butter and salt

00:03:17.846 --> 00:03:21.066
or roast and drizzle with chocolate
for a crunchy snack.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.090
What you have to overcome in "ick factor,"

00:03:23.114 --> 00:03:25.485
you gain in nutrition and taste.

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:27.249
Indeed, bugs can be delicious.

00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:29.276
Mealworms taste like roasted nuts.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.195
Locusts are similar to shrimp.

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:34.864
Crickets, some people say,
have an aroma of popcorn.

00:03:34.888 --> 00:03:38.587
Farming insects for food
also has less environmental impact

00:03:38.611 --> 00:03:40.365
than livestock farms do

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.361
because insects emit
far less greenhouse gas

00:03:43.385 --> 00:03:46.288
and use up less space, water, and food.

00:03:46.312 --> 00:03:48.511
Socioeconomically, bug production

00:03:48.535 --> 00:03:50.641
could uplift people
in developing countries

00:03:50.665 --> 00:03:53.099
since insect farms can be small scale,

00:03:53.123 --> 00:03:57.049
highly productive, and yet
relatively inexpensive to keep.

00:03:57.073 --> 00:04:00.529
Insects can also be turned
into more sustainable food for livestock

00:04:00.553 --> 00:04:02.735
and can be reared on organic waste,

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:04.108
like vegetable peelings,

00:04:04.132 --> 00:04:06.998
that might otherwise
just end up rotting in landfills.

00:04:07.022 --> 00:04:08.640
Feeling hungry yet?

00:04:08.664 --> 00:04:12.777
Faced with a plate of fried crickets,
most people today would still recoil,

00:04:12.801 --> 00:04:16.774
imagining all those legs and feelers
getting stuck between their teeth.

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:18.028
But think of a lobster.

00:04:18.052 --> 00:04:22.383
It's pretty much just a giant insect
with legs and feelers galore

00:04:22.407 --> 00:04:25.587
that was once regarded
as an inferior, repulsive food.

00:04:25.611 --> 00:04:27.596
Now, lobster is a delicacy.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.392
Can the same paradigm shift
happen for bugs?

00:04:30.416 --> 00:04:31.631
So, give it a try!

00:04:31.655 --> 00:04:33.526
Pop that insect into your mouth,

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.247
and savor the crunch.
