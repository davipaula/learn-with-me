00:00:13.165 --> 00:00:16.613
I'm an ocean microbiologist
at the University of Tennessee,

00:00:16.637 --> 00:00:19.182
and I want to tell you guys
about some microbes

00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:22.400
that are so strange and wonderful

00:00:22.424 --> 00:00:26.227
that they're challenging our assumptions
about what life is like on Earth.

00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:27.680
So I have a question.

00:00:27.704 --> 00:00:30.747
Please raise your hand
if you've ever thought it would be cool

00:00:30.771 --> 00:00:33.418
to go to the bottom
of the ocean in a submarine?

00:00:34.372 --> 00:00:35.522
Yes.

00:00:35.546 --> 00:00:37.722
Most of you, because
the oceans are so cool.

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:40.449
Alright, now -- please raise your hand

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:44.163
if the reason you raised your hand
to go to the bottom of the ocean

00:00:44.187 --> 00:00:46.478
is because it would get you
a little bit closer

00:00:46.502 --> 00:00:49.195
to that exciting mud that's down there.

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:50.227
(Laughter)

00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:51.541
Nobody.

00:00:51.565 --> 00:00:53.390
I'm the only one in this room.

00:00:53.414 --> 00:00:55.400
Well, I think about this all the time.

00:00:55.424 --> 00:00:57.689
I spend most of my waking hours

00:00:57.713 --> 00:01:01.499
trying to determine
how deep we can go into the Earth

00:01:01.523 --> 00:01:05.276
and still find something,
anything, that's alive,

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.396
because we still don't know
the answer to this very basic question

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.619
about life on Earth.

00:01:09.643 --> 00:01:13.243
So in the 1980s, a scientist
named John Parkes, in the UK,

00:01:13.267 --> 00:01:15.171
was similarly obsessed,

00:01:15.195 --> 00:01:17.792
and he came up with a crazy idea.

00:01:17.816 --> 00:01:23.474
He believed that there was a vast,
deep, and living microbial biosphere

00:01:23.498 --> 00:01:25.093
underneath all the world's oceans

00:01:25.117 --> 00:01:27.735
that extends hundreds of meters
into the seafloor,

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:28.910
which is cool,

00:01:28.934 --> 00:01:32.076
but the only problem
is that nobody believed him,

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.863
and the reason that nobody believed him

00:01:34.887 --> 00:01:39.067
is that ocean sediments
may be the most boring place on Earth.

00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:40.177
(Laughter)

00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:43.236
There's no sunlight, there's no oxygen,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.799
and perhaps worst of all,

00:01:44.823 --> 00:01:48.998
there's no fresh food deliveries
for literally millions of years.

00:01:49.022 --> 00:01:50.964
You don't have to have a PhD in biology

00:01:50.988 --> 00:01:53.623
to know that that is a bad place
to go looking for life.

00:01:53.647 --> 00:01:54.654
(Laughter)

00:01:54.678 --> 00:01:57.895
But in 2002, [Steven D'Hondt] had
convinced enough people

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.517
that he was on to something 
that he actually got an expedition

00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:05.073
on this drillship,
called the JOIDES Resolution.

00:02:05.097 --> 00:02:08.177
And he ran it along with
Bo Barker JÃ¸rgensen of Denmark.

00:02:08.201 --> 00:02:09.923
And so they were finally able to get

00:02:09.947 --> 00:02:13.312
good pristine deep subsurface samples

00:02:13.336 --> 00:02:16.149
some really without contamination
from surface microbes.

00:02:16.173 --> 00:02:21.446
This drill ship is capable of drilling
thousands of meters underneath the ocean,

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.966
and the mud comes up in sequential cores,
one after the other --

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.660
long, long cores that look like this.

00:02:27.684 --> 00:02:31.493
This is being carried by scientists
such as myself who go on these ships,

00:02:31.517 --> 00:02:34.517
and we process the cores on the ships
and then we send them home

00:02:34.541 --> 00:02:36.640
to our home laboratories
for further study.

00:02:36.664 --> 00:02:38.141
So when John and his colleagues

00:02:38.165 --> 00:02:41.720
got these first precious
deep-sea pristine samples,

00:02:41.744 --> 00:02:43.625
they put them under the microscope,

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:47.758
and they saw images
that looked pretty much like this,

00:02:47.782 --> 00:02:50.259
which is actually taken
from a more recent expedition

00:02:50.283 --> 00:02:52.469
by my PhD student, Joy Buongiorno.

00:02:52.493 --> 00:02:54.781
You can see the hazy stuff
in the background.

00:02:54.805 --> 00:02:57.590
That's mud. That's deep-sea ocean mud,

00:02:57.614 --> 00:03:01.601
and the bright green dots
stained with the green fluorescent dye

00:03:01.625 --> 00:03:04.363
are real, living microbes.

00:03:05.173 --> 00:03:08.203
Now I've got to tell you
something really tragic about microbes.

00:03:08.227 --> 00:03:10.306
They all look the same under a microscope,

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.937
I mean, to a first approximation.

00:03:11.961 --> 00:03:15.553
You can take the most fascinating
organisms in the world,

00:03:15.577 --> 00:03:19.243
like a microbe that literally
breathes uranium,

00:03:19.267 --> 00:03:21.679
and another one that makes rocket fuel,

00:03:21.703 --> 00:03:23.259
mix them up with some ocean mud,

00:03:23.283 --> 00:03:25.480
put them underneath a microscope,

00:03:25.504 --> 00:03:27.315
and they're just little dots.

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:28.770
It's really annoying.

00:03:28.794 --> 00:03:31.285
So we can't use their looks
to tell them apart.

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:33.469
We have to use DNA, like a fingerprint,

00:03:33.493 --> 00:03:35.214
to say who is who.

00:03:35.238 --> 00:03:37.500
And I'll teach you guys
how to do it right now.

00:03:37.524 --> 00:03:41.540
So I made up some data, and I'm going
to show you some data that are not real.

00:03:41.564 --> 00:03:43.747
This is to illustrate
what it would look like

00:03:43.771 --> 00:03:47.151
if a bunch of species
were not related to each other at all.

00:03:47.722 --> 00:03:50.940
So you can see each species

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:55.163
has a list of combinations
of A, G, C and T,

00:03:55.187 --> 00:03:56.902
which are the four sub-units of DNA,

00:03:56.926 --> 00:04:00.711
sort of randomly jumbled,
and nothing looks like anything else,

00:04:00.735 --> 00:04:03.346
and these species
are totally unrelated to each other.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.425
But this is what real DNA looks like,

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:07.900
from a gene that these species
happen to share.

00:04:08.477 --> 00:04:11.465
Everything lines up nearly perfectly.

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.909
The chances of getting
so many of those vertical columns

00:04:14.933 --> 00:04:18.322
where every species has a C
or every species has a T,

00:04:18.346 --> 00:04:21.131
by random chance, are infinitesimal.

00:04:21.155 --> 00:04:26.068
So we know that all those species
had to have had a common ancestor.

00:04:26.092 --> 00:04:27.989
They're all relatives of each other.

00:04:28.013 --> 00:04:29.861
So now I'll tell you who they are.

00:04:30.338 --> 00:04:32.942
The top two are us and chimpanzees,

00:04:32.966 --> 00:04:36.561
which y'all already knew were related,
because, I mean, obviously.

00:04:36.585 --> 00:04:38.045
(Laughter)

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.847
But we're also related to things
that we don't look like,

00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:45.394
like pine trees and Giardia,
which is that gastrointestinal disease

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:48.425
you can get if you don't filter
your water while you're hiking.

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.363
We're also related to bacteria
like E. coli and Clostridium difficile,

00:04:53.387 --> 00:04:56.849
which is a horrible, opportunistic
pathogen that kills lots of people.

00:04:56.873 --> 00:05:01.047
But there's of course good microbes too,
like Dehalococcoides ethenogenes,

00:05:01.071 --> 00:05:03.939
which cleans up
our industrial waste for us.

00:05:03.963 --> 00:05:06.702
So if I take these DNA sequences,

00:05:06.726 --> 00:05:09.869
and then I use them, the similarities
and differences between them,

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:11.722
to make a family tree for all of us

00:05:11.746 --> 00:05:13.611
so you can see who is closely related,

00:05:13.635 --> 00:05:15.540
then this is what it looks like.

00:05:15.564 --> 00:05:17.847
So you can see clearly, at a glance,

00:05:17.871 --> 00:05:23.188
that things like us and Giardia
and bunnies and pine trees

00:05:23.212 --> 00:05:24.988
are all, like, siblings,

00:05:25.012 --> 00:05:28.092
and then the bacteria
are like our ancient cousins.

00:05:28.116 --> 00:05:32.289
But we're kin to every
living thing on Earth.

00:05:32.313 --> 00:05:34.781
So in my job, on a daily basis,

00:05:34.805 --> 00:05:39.136
I get to produce scientific evidence
against existential loneliness.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.024
So when we got these first DNA sequences,

00:05:42.048 --> 00:05:46.248
from the first cruise, of pristine samples
from the deep subsurface,

00:05:46.272 --> 00:05:48.121
we wanted to know where they were.

00:05:48.145 --> 00:05:51.359
So the first thing that we discovered
is that they were not aliens,

00:05:51.383 --> 00:05:54.968
because we could get their DNA to line up
with everything else on Earth.

00:05:54.992 --> 00:05:58.190
But now check out where they go
on our tree of life.

00:05:59.468 --> 00:06:02.570
The first thing you'll notice
is that there's a lot of them.

00:06:02.594 --> 00:06:04.419
It wasn't just one little species

00:06:04.443 --> 00:06:06.562
that managed to live
in this horrible place.

00:06:06.586 --> 00:06:08.069
It's kind of a lot of things.

00:06:08.093 --> 00:06:10.051
And the second thing that you'll notice,

00:06:10.075 --> 00:06:14.895
hopefully, is that they're not
like anything we've ever seen before.

00:06:15.482 --> 00:06:17.616
They are as different from each other

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.505
as they are from anything
that we've known before

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:22.490
as we are from pine trees.

00:06:22.514 --> 00:06:25.695
So John Parkes was completely correct.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.847
He, and we, had discovered
a completely new and highly diverse

00:06:30.871 --> 00:06:32.841
microbial ecosystem on Earth

00:06:32.865 --> 00:06:36.706
that no one even knew existed
before the 1980s.

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:38.692
So now we were on a roll.

00:06:38.716 --> 00:06:43.428
The next step was to grow
these exotic species in a petri dish

00:06:43.452 --> 00:06:45.622
so that we could
do real experiments on them

00:06:45.646 --> 00:06:47.685
like microbiologists are supposed to do.

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:49.651
But no matter what we fed them,

00:06:49.675 --> 00:06:51.238
they refused to grow.

00:06:51.825 --> 00:06:55.832
Even now, 15 years
and many expeditions later,

00:06:55.856 --> 00:07:01.260
no human has ever gotten a single one
of these exotic deep subsurface microbes

00:07:01.284 --> 00:07:02.947
to grow in a petri dish.

00:07:02.971 --> 00:07:04.657
And it's not for lack of trying.

00:07:05.185 --> 00:07:07.161
That may sound disappointing,

00:07:07.185 --> 00:07:08.908
but I actually find it exhilarating,

00:07:08.932 --> 00:07:12.503
because it means there are so many
tantalizing unknowns to work on.

00:07:12.527 --> 00:07:16.114
Like, my colleagues and I got
what we thought was a really great idea.

00:07:16.138 --> 00:07:19.419
We were going to read their genes
like a recipe book,

00:07:19.443 --> 00:07:22.920
find out what it was they wanted to eat
and put it in their petri dishes,

00:07:22.944 --> 00:07:24.855
and then they would grow and be happy.

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:26.530
But when we looked at their genes,

00:07:26.554 --> 00:07:30.622
it turns out that what they wanted to eat
was the food we were already feeding them.

00:07:30.646 --> 00:07:32.256
So that was a total wash.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.257
There was something else
that they wanted in their petri dishes

00:07:35.281 --> 00:07:37.097
that we were just not giving them.

00:07:38.248 --> 00:07:41.954
So by combining measurements
from many different places

00:07:41.978 --> 00:07:43.136
around the world,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.823
my colleagues at the University
of Southern California,

00:07:46.847 --> 00:07:48.553
Doug LaRowe and Jan Amend,

00:07:48.577 --> 00:07:53.280
were able to calculate that each one
of these deep-sea microbial cells

00:07:53.304 --> 00:07:56.670
requires only one zeptowatt of power,

00:07:56.694 --> 00:08:00.634
and before you get your phones out,
a zepto is 10 to the minus 21,

00:08:00.658 --> 00:08:02.706
because I know I would want
to look that up.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:04.261
Humans, on the other hand,

00:08:04.285 --> 00:08:06.874
require about 100 watts of power.

00:08:06.898 --> 00:08:10.409
So 100 watts is basically
if you take a pineapple

00:08:10.433 --> 00:08:16.643
and drop it from about waist height
to the ground 881,632 times a day.

00:08:16.667 --> 00:08:19.048
If you did that
and then linked it up to a turbine,

00:08:19.072 --> 00:08:22.310
that would create enough power
to make me happen for a day.

00:08:23.177 --> 00:08:25.970
A zeptowatt, if you put it
in similar terms,

00:08:25.994 --> 00:08:30.077
is if you take just one grain of salt

00:08:30.101 --> 00:08:33.719
and then you imagine
a tiny, tiny, little ball

00:08:33.743 --> 00:08:37.359
that is one thousandth of the mass
of that one grain of salt

00:08:37.383 --> 00:08:40.192
and then you drop it one nanometer,

00:08:40.216 --> 00:08:44.398
which is a hundred times smaller
than the wavelength of visible light,

00:08:44.422 --> 00:08:46.057
once per day.

00:08:46.773 --> 00:08:49.971
That's all it takes
to make these microbes live.

00:08:50.717 --> 00:08:56.082
That's less energy than we ever thought
would be capable of supporting life,

00:08:56.106 --> 00:08:59.180
but somehow, amazingly, beautifully,

00:08:59.204 --> 00:09:00.394
it's enough.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.203
So if these deep-subsurface microbes

00:09:03.227 --> 00:09:06.779
have a very different relationship
with energy than we previously thought,

00:09:06.803 --> 00:09:08.767
then it follows that they'll have to have

00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:10.948
a different relationship
with time as well,

00:09:10.972 --> 00:09:14.067
because when you live
on such tiny energy gradients,

00:09:14.091 --> 00:09:15.786
rapid growth is impossible.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.827
If these things wanted
to colonize our throats and make us sick,

00:09:18.851 --> 00:09:21.471
they would get muscled out
by fast-growing streptococcus

00:09:21.495 --> 00:09:23.656
before they could even
initiate cell division.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.442
So that's why we never
find them in our throats.

00:09:27.537 --> 00:09:31.712
Perhaps the fact that the deep
subsurface is so boring

00:09:31.736 --> 00:09:34.226
is actually an asset to these microbes.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.338
They never get washed out by a storm.

00:09:36.362 --> 00:09:38.527
They never get overgrown by weeds.

00:09:39.125 --> 00:09:42.321
All they have to do is exist.

00:09:42.807 --> 00:09:46.817
Maybe that thing that we were missing
in our petri dishes

00:09:46.841 --> 00:09:48.562
was not food at all.

00:09:48.586 --> 00:09:50.064
Maybe it wasn't a chemical.

00:09:50.088 --> 00:09:51.914
Maybe the thing that they really want,

00:09:51.938 --> 00:09:54.770
the nutrient that they want, is time.

00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:59.671
But time is the one thing
that I'll never be able to give them.

00:09:59.695 --> 00:10:02.909
So even if I have a cell culture
that I pass to my PhD students,

00:10:02.933 --> 00:10:05.424
who pass it to their
PhD students, and so on,

00:10:05.448 --> 00:10:08.016
we'd have to do that
for thousands of years

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.271
in order to mimic the exact conditions
of the deep subsurface,

00:10:11.295 --> 00:10:13.614
all without growing any contaminants.

00:10:13.638 --> 00:10:14.936
It's just not possible.

00:10:15.637 --> 00:10:18.763
But maybe in a way we already have
grown them in our petri dishes.

00:10:18.787 --> 00:10:21.597
Maybe they looked at all that food
we offered them and said,

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.483
"Thanks, I'm going to speed up so much

00:10:23.507 --> 00:10:25.747
that I'm going to make
a new cell next century.

00:10:25.771 --> 00:10:26.932
Ugh.

00:10:26.956 --> 00:10:27.995
(Laughter)

00:10:28.019 --> 00:10:33.128
So why is it that the rest
of biology moves so fast?

00:10:33.152 --> 00:10:35.058
Why does a cell die after a day

00:10:35.082 --> 00:10:37.593
and a human dies
after only a hundred years?

00:10:37.617 --> 00:10:40.058
These seem like really
arbitrarily short limits

00:10:40.082 --> 00:10:43.081
when you think about the total amount
of time in the universe.

00:10:43.105 --> 00:10:45.916
But these are not arbitrary limits.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.831
They're dictated by one simple thing,

00:10:48.855 --> 00:10:50.914
and that thing is the Sun.

00:10:51.785 --> 00:10:54.535
Once life figured out how to harness
the energy of the Sun

00:10:54.559 --> 00:10:55.721
through photosynthesis,

00:10:55.745 --> 00:10:58.664
we all had to speed up
and get on day and night cycles.

00:10:58.688 --> 00:11:02.042
In that way, the Sun gave us
both a reason to be fast

00:11:02.066 --> 00:11:03.673
and the fuel to do it.

00:11:03.697 --> 00:11:06.556
You can view most of life on Earth
like a circulatory system,

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.270
and the Sun is our beating heart.

00:11:09.064 --> 00:11:11.897
But the deep subsurface
is like a circulatory system

00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:14.356
that's completely
disconnected from the Sun.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:18.872
It's instead being driven
by long, slow geological rhythms.

00:11:19.933 --> 00:11:25.321
There's currently no theoretical limit
on the lifespan of one single cell.

00:11:26.632 --> 00:11:30.600
As long as there is at least
a tiny energy gradient to exploit,

00:11:30.624 --> 00:11:32.808
theoretically, a single cell could live

00:11:32.832 --> 00:11:34.974
for hundreds of thousands
of years or more,

00:11:34.998 --> 00:11:37.442
simply by replacing
broken parts over time.

00:11:38.047 --> 00:11:42.380
To ask a microbe that lives like that
to grow in our petri dishes

00:11:42.404 --> 00:11:47.467
is to ask them to adapt to our frenetic,
Sun-centric, fast way of living,

00:11:47.491 --> 00:11:49.984
and maybe they've got
better things to do than that.

00:11:50.008 --> 00:11:51.317
(Laughter)

00:11:51.341 --> 00:11:55.618
Imagine if we could figure out
how they managed to do this.

00:11:55.642 --> 00:11:58.928
What if it involves some cool,
ultra-stable compounds

00:11:58.952 --> 00:12:01.213
that we could use
to increase the shelf life

00:12:01.237 --> 00:12:03.824
in biomedical or industrial applications?

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:06.404
Or maybe if we figure out
the mechanism that they use

00:12:06.428 --> 00:12:09.546
to grow so extraordinarily slowly,

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:12.920
we could mimic it in cancer cells
and slow runaway cell division.

00:12:13.928 --> 00:12:15.118
I don't know.

00:12:15.142 --> 00:12:18.173
I mean, honestly, that is all speculation,

00:12:18.197 --> 00:12:20.646
but the only thing I know for certain

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:24.743
is that there are
a hundred billion billion billlion

00:12:24.767 --> 00:12:26.871
living microbial cells

00:12:26.895 --> 00:12:29.093
underlying all the world's oceans.

00:12:29.117 --> 00:12:33.482
That's 200 times more than the total
biomass of humans on this planet.

00:12:33.966 --> 00:12:37.672
And those microbes have
a fundamentally different relationship

00:12:37.696 --> 00:12:39.561
with time and energy than we do.

00:12:39.989 --> 00:12:42.231
What seems like a day to them

00:12:42.255 --> 00:12:44.572
might be a thousand years to us.

00:12:45.072 --> 00:12:47.091
They don't care about the Sun,

00:12:47.115 --> 00:12:49.326
and they don't care about growing fast,

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.247
and they probably don't give a damn
about my petri dishes ...

00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:53.294
(Laughter)

00:12:53.334 --> 00:12:57.260
but if we can continue to find
creative ways to study them,

00:12:57.284 --> 00:13:03.619
then maybe we'll finally figure out
what life, all of life, is like on Earth.

00:13:04.031 --> 00:13:05.182
Thank you.

00:13:05.206 --> 00:13:06.998
(Applause)
