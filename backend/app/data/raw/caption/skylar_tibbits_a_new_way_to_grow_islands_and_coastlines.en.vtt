00:00:13.458 --> 00:00:14.768
For nearly a decade,

00:00:14.792 --> 00:00:17.018
my collaborators and I
at the Self-Assembly Lab

00:00:17.042 --> 00:00:20.559
have been working on material systems
that transform themselves,

00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:21.893
assemble themselves

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:23.542
and adapt to their environment.

00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.768
From our early work on 4D printing,

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:29.143
where we printed objects,
dipped them underwater,

00:00:29.167 --> 00:00:30.976
and they transform,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.434
to our active auxetics that respond
to temperature and sunlight,

00:00:35.458 --> 00:00:37.601
to our more recent work on active textiles

00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:41.226
that respond to body temperature
and change porosity,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.893
to our rapid liquid printing work

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:44.768
where we print inflatable structures

00:00:44.792 --> 00:00:46.893
that morph based on air pressure

00:00:46.917 --> 00:00:49.351
and go from one shape to another,

00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:50.726
or our self-assembly work

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.643
where we dip objects underwater,

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:55.559
they respond to wave energy
and assemble themselves

00:00:55.583 --> 00:00:57.875
into precise objects like furniture.

00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:00.226
Or, at larger scales,

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.601
using wind energy,

00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:03.559
we have meter-diameter weather balloons

00:01:03.583 --> 00:01:06.559
that assemble in the airspace
above a construction site.

00:01:06.583 --> 00:01:09.476
For dangerous environments
or harsh, extreme places

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.559
where it's hard to get
people or equipment,

00:01:11.583 --> 00:01:14.393
they can assemble in the airspace,
and as the helium dies,

00:01:14.417 --> 00:01:16.101
they then come back to the ground,

00:01:16.125 --> 00:01:18.934
and you're left with a big
space frame structure.

00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:22.601
All of this research is about
taking simple materials,

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:25.393
activating them with forces
in their environment --

00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:28.393
gravity, wind, waves,
temperature, sunlight --

00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:29.893
and getting them to perform,

00:01:29.917 --> 00:01:32.643
getting them to transform, assemble, etc.

00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:34.309
How do we build smart things

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:37.726
without complex electromechanical devices?

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.768
But more recently we were approached
by a group in the Maldives,

00:01:40.792 --> 00:01:44.434
and they were interested in taking
some of this research and ways of thinking

00:01:44.458 --> 00:01:47.309
and applying it to some
of the challenges that they've faced

00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:48.684
in terms of climate change.

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:50.018
And the first thing you do

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:52.393
when you're approached
by someone in the Maldives

00:01:52.417 --> 00:01:54.309
is say you want to go on a site visit.

00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:55.351
(Laughter)

00:01:55.375 --> 00:01:56.643
It is amazing.

00:01:56.667 --> 00:01:57.934
So we went there

00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.893
and I actually walked away
with a really different perspective

00:02:00.917 --> 00:02:02.518
on the future of climate change.

00:02:02.542 --> 00:02:05.518
Because you would imagine,
you know, the Maldives are sinking.

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:07.601
They're screwed.
What are they going to do?

00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:10.143
But I walked away thinking,
they might be the model,

00:02:10.167 --> 00:02:13.934
the future model of the built environment,
where they can adapt and be resilient

00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.226
rather than our fixed,
man-made infrastructure.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.309
But there's typically
three main approaches

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:20.184
to sea level rise and climate change.

00:02:20.208 --> 00:02:23.018
One of them is that we can do nothing
and we can run away.

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:24.851
And that's a pretty bad idea.

00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:27.226
As more than 40 percent
of the world's population

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.226
is living in coastal areas,

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.976
as sea levels rise
and as storms get worse and worse,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.143
we're going to be
more and more underwater.

00:02:34.167 --> 00:02:38.309
So it's imperative that we solve
this pretty demanding problem.

00:02:38.333 --> 00:02:40.893
The second is that we can build barriers.

00:02:40.917 --> 00:02:42.268
We can build walls.

00:02:42.292 --> 00:02:45.268
The problem here is that
we take a static solution

00:02:45.292 --> 00:02:49.976
trying to fight against a superdynamic,
high-energy problem,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.643
and nature is almost always going to win.

00:02:52.667 --> 00:02:54.726
So that's likely not going to work either.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.809
The third approach is using dredging.

00:02:56.833 --> 00:03:00.101
So dredging is where you suck up
a bunch of sand from the deep ocean

00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:01.976
and you pump it back onto the beaches.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.893
If you go to any beach
around the Northeast or Western Coast,

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:07.768
you'll see that they use dredging
year after year after year

00:03:07.792 --> 00:03:09.059
just to survive.

00:03:09.083 --> 00:03:10.893
It's really not a good solution.

00:03:10.917 --> 00:03:14.809
In the Maldives, they do the same thing,
and they can build an island in a month,

00:03:14.833 --> 00:03:17.434
a brand new island
they build from dredging.

00:03:17.458 --> 00:03:20.268
But it's really, really bad
for the marine ecosystem,

00:03:20.292 --> 00:03:22.351
and then they become addicted to dredging.

00:03:22.375 --> 00:03:24.184
They need to do that year after year.

00:03:24.208 --> 00:03:27.018
But in the time that it took them
to build that one island,

00:03:27.042 --> 00:03:29.393
three sandbars built themselves,

00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:31.726
and these are massive amounts of sand

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.768
so big you can park your boat on it,

00:03:33.792 --> 00:03:35.976
and this is what's called a site visit.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.309
It's really hard work.

00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:39.351
(Laughter)

00:03:39.375 --> 00:03:40.958
In Boston winters.

00:03:41.917 --> 00:03:45.476
This is massive amounts of sand
that naturally accumulates

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.601
just based on the forces of the waves

00:03:47.625 --> 00:03:49.476
and the ocean topography.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.893
So we started to study that.
Why do sandbars form?

00:03:51.917 --> 00:03:53.226
If we could tap into that,

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.601
we could understand it
and we could utilize it.

00:03:55.625 --> 00:03:57.976
It's based on the amount
of energy in the ocean

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.893
and the topography in the landscape
that promotes sand accumulation.

00:04:01.917 --> 00:04:05.184
So what we're proposing
is to work with the forces of nature

00:04:05.208 --> 00:04:07.351
to build rather than destroy,

00:04:07.375 --> 00:04:09.726
and in my lab at MIT,
we set up a wave tank,

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.893
a big tank that's pumping waves,

00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:14.059
and we placed geometries underwater.

00:04:14.083 --> 00:04:16.601
We tried all sorts
of different geometries.

00:04:16.625 --> 00:04:19.101
The waves interact with the geometry,

00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:22.559
and then create turbulence
and start to accumulate the sand

00:04:22.583 --> 00:04:26.018
so the sand starts to form
these sandbars on their own.

00:04:26.042 --> 00:04:27.351
Here's an aerial view.

00:04:27.375 --> 00:04:30.184
On the left-hand side,
you'll see the beach that's growing.

00:04:30.208 --> 00:04:32.559
In the middle you'll see
the sandbar that formed.

00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:36.268
So these are geometries that collaborate
with the force of the wave to build.

00:04:36.292 --> 00:04:39.434
We then started to fabricate one.
This was in February in Boston.

00:04:39.458 --> 00:04:41.809
We have large rolls of canvas.

00:04:41.833 --> 00:04:43.434
It's a biodegradable material,

00:04:43.458 --> 00:04:45.976
it's super cheap, easy to work with.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.851
We then sew it into these large bladders,

00:04:48.875 --> 00:04:50.351
and then we flew over there.

00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:53.393
And I know what you're thinking.
This is not the Fyre Festival.

00:04:53.417 --> 00:04:54.893
(Laughter)

00:04:54.917 --> 00:04:57.226
This is real life. It's real.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.143
And we flew there with these
canvas bladders in our suitcases,

00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:04.059
we got sunburned
because it was Boston winter,

00:05:04.083 --> 00:05:07.101
and then we filled them with sand
and we placed them underwater.

00:05:07.125 --> 00:05:10.309
These are exactly the same geometries
that you saw in the tank,

00:05:10.333 --> 00:05:12.143
they're just human scale.

00:05:12.167 --> 00:05:13.851
Large objects filled with sand,

00:05:13.875 --> 00:05:17.393
we'd place them underwater,
they're just really simple geometries.

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:20.351
In the front of them,
you'll see it's clear water.

00:05:20.375 --> 00:05:22.559
The waves are crashing over.

00:05:22.583 --> 00:05:23.893
It's quite clear.

00:05:23.917 --> 00:05:26.059
And then on the backside,
there's turbulence.

00:05:26.083 --> 00:05:28.309
The water and the sand is mixing up.

00:05:28.333 --> 00:05:31.809
It's causing sediment transport,
and then the sand is accumulating.

00:05:31.833 --> 00:05:34.768
You'll see some friendly stingrays
here that visited us.

00:05:34.792 --> 00:05:37.559
On the left is day one,
the right is day three.

00:05:37.583 --> 00:05:39.809
You'll see the sand ripples
in the light areas

00:05:39.833 --> 00:05:41.309
where the sand is accumulating

00:05:41.333 --> 00:05:43.059
just after two days.

00:05:43.083 --> 00:05:46.476
So this was last February,
and it's very much ongoing work.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.059
This is just in the beginning
of this research.

00:05:49.083 --> 00:05:50.809
Over the next year and longer,

00:05:50.833 --> 00:05:53.601
we're going to be studying this
through satellite imagery

00:05:53.625 --> 00:05:54.934
and bathymetry data

00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:58.476
to understand what the short-term
and long-term impacts are

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.476
of natural sand accumulation
in the environment.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.018
And the bigger vision, though,

00:06:03.042 --> 00:06:05.351
is that we want to build
submersible geometries,

00:06:05.375 --> 00:06:08.476
almost like submarines
that we can sink and float.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.601
Like adaptable artificial reefs,

00:06:10.625 --> 00:06:11.893
you could deploy them

00:06:11.917 --> 00:06:15.226
if there's a storm coming
from one direction or another

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.768
or if the seasons are changing,

00:06:16.792 --> 00:06:19.268
you can use these
adaptable reef structures

00:06:19.292 --> 00:06:22.559
to use the force of the waves
to accumulate sand.

00:06:22.583 --> 00:06:25.184
And we think this could be used
in many coastal regions

00:06:25.208 --> 00:06:27.934
and many island nations around the world.

00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.559
But when we think about building
smarter environments,

00:06:30.583 --> 00:06:34.268
think of smarter buildings
or smarter cars or smarter clothing,

00:06:34.292 --> 00:06:36.768
that typically means adding more power,

00:06:36.792 --> 00:06:40.809
more batteries, more devices,
more cost, more complexity

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:43.059
and ultimately more failure.

00:06:43.083 --> 00:06:46.934
So we're always trying to think about
how do we build smarter things with less?

00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.684
How do we build smarter things
that are simple?

00:06:49.708 --> 00:06:53.351
And so what we're proposing at the lab
and with this project specifically

00:06:53.375 --> 00:06:56.101
is to use simple materials like sand

00:06:56.125 --> 00:06:59.476
that collaborates with forces
in the environment like waves

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.768
to accumulate and adapt.

00:07:01.792 --> 00:07:05.101
And we'd like to work with you,
collaborate with us, to develop this,

00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:07.559
to scale it and apply
this way of thinking.

00:07:07.583 --> 00:07:10.351
We think it's a different
model for climate change,

00:07:10.375 --> 00:07:13.018
one that's about adaptation and resilience

00:07:13.042 --> 00:07:16.018
rather than resistance and fear.

00:07:16.042 --> 00:07:20.601
So help us turn natural destruction
into natural construction.

00:07:20.625 --> 00:07:21.934
Thank you.

00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.583
(Applause)
