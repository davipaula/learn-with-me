00:00:12.873 --> 00:00:15.296
It was just an ordinary Saturday.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.536
My dad was outside mowing the lawn,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.816
my mom was upstairs folding laundry,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.976
my sister was in her room doing homework

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.360
and I was in the basement
playing video games.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.416
And as I came upstairs
to get something to drink,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.656
I looked out the window

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.976
and realized that there was something
that I was supposed to be doing,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.200
and this is what I saw.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.976
No, this wasn't
my family's dinner on fire.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.640
This was my science project.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.696
Flames were pouring out,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.936
smoke was in the air

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.176
and it looked like our wooden deck
was about to catch fire.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.016
I immediately started yelling.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.536
My mom was freaking out,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.656
my dad ran around to put out the fire

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.816
and of course my sister
started recording a Snapchat video.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.736
(Laughter)

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.960
This was just the beginning
of my team's science project.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.136
My team is composed of me
and three other students

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.840
who are here in the audience today.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.296
We competed in FIRST LEGO League

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.856
which is an international
LEGO robotics competition for kids,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.736
and in addition to a robotics game,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.136
we also worked
on a separate science project,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.856
and this was the project
that we were working on.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.856
So the idea for this project all started

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.136
when a few months earlier,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.976
a couple of my teammates
took a trip to Central America

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.496
and saw beaches littered with Styrofoam,

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.480
or expanded polystyrene foam.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.176
And when they came back
and told us about it,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.896
we really started thinking about the ways
in which we see Styrofoam every day.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.536
Get a new flat-screen TV?

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.520
You end up with a block of Styrofoam
bigger than the TV itself.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.536
Drink a cup of coffee?

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.736
Well, those Styrofoam coffee cups
are sure going to add up.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.136
And where do all these items go
after their one-time use?

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.576
Since there aren't any good
existing solutions for used Styrofoam,

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.136
almost all of them
end up right in the landfill,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.496
or the oceans and beaches,

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.216
taking over 500 years to degrade.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.456
And in fact, every year, the US alone

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.136
produces over two billion
pounds of Styrofoam,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.336
filling up a staggering
25 percent of landfills.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.440
So why do we have these ghost
accumulations of Styrofoam waste?

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.840
Why can't we just recycle them
like many plastics?

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.816
Well, simply put, recycled
polystyrene is too expensive

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.416
and potentially contaminated,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.656
so there is very little market demand
for Styrofoam that has to be recycled.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.216
And as a result, Styrofoam
is considered a nonrenewable material,

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.000
because it is neither feasible
nor viable to recycle polystyrene.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.176
And in fact, many cities across the US

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.616
have even passed ordinances

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.256
that simply ban the production
of many products containing polystyrene,

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.336
which includes disposable utensils,

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.536
packing peanuts, takeout containers

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.696
and even plastic beach toys,

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.696
all products that are very useful
in today's society.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.896
And now France
has become the first country

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.176
to completely ban all plastic utensils,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.800
cups and plates.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.696
But what if we could keep using Styrofoam

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.456
and keep benefiting
from its cheap, lightweight, insulating

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.216
and excellent packing ability,

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.576
while not having to suffer
from the repercussions

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.920
of having to dispose of it?

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.816
What if we could turn it into
something else that's actually useful?

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.400
What if we could make
the impossible possible?

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.976
My team hypothesized that we could use
the carbon that's already in Styrofoam

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.696
to create activated carbon,

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.080
which is used in almost
every water filter today.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.096
And activated carbon works
by using very small micropores

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.080
to filter out contaminants
from water or even air.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.016
So we started out
by doing a variety of heating tests,

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.120
and unfortunately, we had many failures.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.176
Literally, nothing worked.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.456
Besides my dad's grill catching on fire,

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.136
most of our samples
vaporized into nothing,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.576
or exploded inside expensive furnaces,

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.840
leaving a horribly sticky mess.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.040
In fact, we were so saddened
by our failures that we almost gave up.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.696
So why did we keep trying

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.096
when all the adults
said it was impossible?

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.040
Well, maybe it's because we're kids.
We don't know any better.

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:08.256
But the truth is, we kept trying
because we thought it was still possible.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.976
We knew that if we were successful,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.416
we would be helping the environment
and making the world a better place.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.096
So we kept trying

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.856
and failing

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.536
and trying

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.136
and failing.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.800
We were so ready to give up.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.216
But then it happened.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.936
With the right temperatures,
times and chemicals,

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.216
we finally got that successful test result

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.055
showing us that we had created
activated carbon from Styrofoam waste.

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:35.656
And at that moment,
the thing that had been impossible

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.920
all of a sudden wasn't.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.536
It showed us that although we had
many failures at the beginning,

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.256
we were able to persevere through them
to get the test results that we wanted.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.216
And moreover, not only were we able
to create activated carbon

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.496
for purifying water,

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.976
but we were also able
to reduce Styrofoam waste,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.760
solving two global problems
with just one solution.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.256
So from then on, we were inspired
to take our project further,

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.496
performing more tests
to make it more effective

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.856
and testing it in real world situations.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.616
We then proceeded to receive funding

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.616
from the NSTA's eCYBERMISSION
STEM-in-Action program

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.376
sponsored by the US Army,

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.776
as well as FIRST Global Innovation Awards

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.080
sponsored by XPRIZE.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.896
And we were also honored

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.696
with the Scientific American
Innovator Award

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.960
from Google Science Fair.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.936
And using these funds, we plan
to file a full patent on our process

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.840
and to continue to work on our project.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.616
So yes, although we started
with catching my dad's grill on fire

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.136
and failing so many times
that we almost quit,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.696
it was well worth it
when we look back at it now.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.536
We took a problem
that many people said was impossible

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.056
and we made it possible,

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.336
and we persevered when it looked
like nothing that we did would work.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.456
We learned that you can't have success

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.976
without a little,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.760
or a lot, of failure.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.056
So in the future, don't be afraid
if your grill goes up in flames,

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.960
because you never know
when your idea might just catch fire.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.016
Thank you.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.520
(Applause)
