00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.325
If we evolved from monkeys,
why are there still monkeys?

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:18.728
(Laughter)

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:20.840
Well, because we're not monkeys,

00:00:20.864 --> 00:00:22.014
we're fish.

00:00:22.038 --> 00:00:23.077
(Laughter)

00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:26.049
Now, knowing you're a fish
and not a monkey

00:00:26.073 --> 00:00:30.500
is actually really important
to understanding where we came from.

00:00:30.524 --> 00:00:34.261
I teach one of the largest
evolutionary biology classes in the US,

00:00:34.285 --> 00:00:38.344
and when my students finally understand
why I call them fish all the time,

00:00:38.368 --> 00:00:40.545
then I know I'm getting my job done.

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:45.613
But I always have to start my classes
by dispelling some hardwired myths,

00:00:45.637 --> 00:00:49.684
because without really knowing it,
many of us were taught evolution wrong.

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:54.277
For instance, we're taught
to say "the theory of evolution."

00:00:54.944 --> 00:00:58.761
There are actually many theories,
and just like the process itself,

00:00:58.785 --> 00:01:02.539
the ones that best fit the data
are the ones that survive to this day.

00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:06.384
The one we know best
is Darwinian natural selection.

00:01:06.963 --> 00:01:10.923
That's the process by which organisms
that best fit an environment

00:01:10.947 --> 00:01:13.167
survive and get to reproduce,

00:01:13.191 --> 00:01:15.857
while those that are less fit
slowly die off.

00:01:16.698 --> 00:01:17.874
And that's it.

00:01:17.898 --> 00:01:20.842
Evolution is as simple as that,
and it's a fact.

00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:25.785
Evolution is a fact
as much as the "theory of gravity."

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.181
You can prove it just as easily.

00:01:28.205 --> 00:01:30.268
You just need to look at your bellybutton

00:01:30.292 --> 00:01:32.458
that you share
with other placental mammals,

00:01:32.482 --> 00:01:35.502
or your backbone that you share
with other vertebrates,

00:01:35.526 --> 00:01:38.867
or your DNA that you share
with all other life on earth.

00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:41.724
Those traits didn't pop up in humans.

00:01:41.748 --> 00:01:44.504
They were passed down
from different ancestors

00:01:44.528 --> 00:01:46.677
to all their descendants, not just us.

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.993
But that's not really
how we learn biology early on, is it?

00:01:51.017 --> 00:01:54.436
We learn plants and bacteria
are primitive things,

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.614
and fish give rise to amphibians
followed by reptiles and mammals,

00:01:57.638 --> 00:01:59.421
and then you get you,

00:01:59.445 --> 00:02:02.143
this perfectly evolved creature
at the end of the line.

00:02:03.032 --> 00:02:05.766
But life doesn't evolve in a line,

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.426
and it doesn't end with us.

00:02:08.591 --> 00:02:12.051
But we're always shown evolution
portrayed something like this,

00:02:12.075 --> 00:02:14.463
a monkey and a chimpanzee,

00:02:14.487 --> 00:02:15.723
some extinct humans,

00:02:15.747 --> 00:02:18.999
all on a forward and steady march
to becoming us.

00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:23.216
But they don't become us
any more than we would become them.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.641
We're also not the goal of evolution.

00:02:27.298 --> 00:02:28.799
But why does it matter?

00:02:28.823 --> 00:02:31.695
Why do we need to understand
evolution the right way?

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.108
Well, misunderstanding evolution
has led to many problems,

00:02:36.132 --> 00:02:40.448
but you can't ask that age-old question,

00:02:40.472 --> 00:02:42.179
"Where are we from?"

00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:45.012
without understanding
evolution the right way.

00:02:45.036 --> 00:02:50.892
Misunderstanding it has led
to many convoluted and corrupted views

00:02:50.916 --> 00:02:53.963
of how we should treat
other life on earth,

00:02:53.987 --> 00:02:55.852
and how we should treat each other

00:02:55.876 --> 00:02:57.542
in terms of race and gender.

00:02:59.253 --> 00:03:02.260
So let's go back four billion years.

00:03:02.927 --> 00:03:06.051
This is the single-celled organism
we all came from.

00:03:06.075 --> 00:03:09.400
At first, it gave rise
to other single-celled life,

00:03:09.424 --> 00:03:11.916
but these are still evolving to this day,

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.130
and some would say
the Archaea and Bacteria

00:03:14.154 --> 00:03:16.004
that make up most of this group

00:03:16.028 --> 00:03:18.151
is the most successful on the planet.

00:03:18.175 --> 00:03:20.651
They are certainly going
to be here well after us.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.180
About three billion years ago,
multicellularity evolved.

00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:28.315
This includes your fungi
and your plants and your animals.

00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:32.790
The first animals to develop
a backbone were fishes.

00:03:33.385 --> 00:03:37.306
So technically,
all vertebrates are fishes,

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.693
so technically, you and I are fish.

00:03:40.717 --> 00:03:42.415
So don't say I didn't warn you.

00:03:43.526 --> 00:03:45.607
One fish lineage came onto land

00:03:45.631 --> 00:03:49.537
and gave rise to, among other things,
the mammals and reptiles.

00:03:49.561 --> 00:03:53.885
Some reptiles become birds,
some mammals become primates,

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.670
some primates become monkeys with tails,

00:03:56.694 --> 00:04:01.487
and others become the great apes,
including a variety of human species.

00:04:01.511 --> 00:04:03.887
So you see, we didn't evolve from monkeys,

00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:06.062
but we do share
a common ancestor with them.

00:04:06.824 --> 00:04:09.744
All the while, life
around us kept evolving:

00:04:09.768 --> 00:04:13.710
more bacteria, more fungi,
lots of fish, fish, fish.

00:04:13.734 --> 00:04:16.321
If you couldn't tell --
yes, they're my favorite group.

00:04:16.345 --> 00:04:17.346
(Laughter)

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.307
As life evolves, it also goes extinct.

00:04:20.331 --> 00:04:23.618
Most species just last
for a few million years.

00:04:23.642 --> 00:04:26.395
So you see, most life on earth
that we see around us today

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.614
are about the same age as our species.

00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:32.260
So it's hubris,
it's self-centered to think,

00:04:32.284 --> 00:04:34.855
"Oh, plants and bacteria are primitive,

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:37.117
and we've been here
for an evolutionary minute,

00:04:37.141 --> 00:04:38.584
so we're somehow special."

00:04:39.172 --> 00:04:43.489
Think of life as being this book,
an unfinished book for sure.

00:04:44.085 --> 00:04:47.418
We're just seeing the last
few pages of each chapter.

00:04:48.386 --> 00:04:50.648
If you look out
on the eight million species

00:04:50.672 --> 00:04:52.297
that we share this planet with,

00:04:52.321 --> 00:04:56.839
think of them all being
four billion years of evolution.

00:04:56.863 --> 00:04:58.582
They're all the product of that.

00:04:59.386 --> 00:05:04.218
Think of us all as young leaves
on this ancient and gigantic tree of life,

00:05:04.242 --> 00:05:08.543
all of us connected by invisible branches
not just to each other,

00:05:08.567 --> 00:05:11.853
but to our extinct relatives
and our evolutionary ancestors.

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:15.856
As a biologist, I'm still
trying to learn, with others,

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.075
how everyone's related to each other,
who is related to whom.

00:05:20.831 --> 00:05:23.109
Perhaps it's better still

00:05:23.133 --> 00:05:26.829
to think of us
as a little fish out of water.

00:05:26.853 --> 00:05:29.773
Yes, one that learned to walk and talk,

00:05:29.797 --> 00:05:32.146
but one that still has
a lot of learning to do

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.841
about who we are and where we came from.

00:05:35.348 --> 00:05:36.499
Thank you.

00:05:36.523 --> 00:05:40.501
(Applause)
