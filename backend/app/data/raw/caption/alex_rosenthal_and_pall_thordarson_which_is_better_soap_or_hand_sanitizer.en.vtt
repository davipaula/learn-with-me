00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:11.127
Your hands, up close, 
are anything but smooth.

00:00:11.127 --> 00:00:13.927
With peaks and valleys, folds and rifts,

00:00:13.927 --> 00:00:18.231
there are plenty of hiding places 
for a virus to stick.

00:00:18.231 --> 00:00:21.841
If you then touch your face, 
the virus can infect you.

00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:26.566
But there are two extraordinarily simple 
ways you can keep that from happening:

00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:29.434
soap and water, and hand sanitizer.

00:00:29.434 --> 00:00:32.014
So which is better?

00:00:32.014 --> 00:00:34.864
The coronavirus that causes COVID-19

00:00:34.864 --> 00:00:41.018
is one of many viruses whose protective
outer surface is made of a lipid bilayer.

00:00:41.018 --> 00:00:46.377
These lipids are pin shaped molecules 
whose heads are attracted to water,

00:00:46.377 --> 00:00:49.287
and tails are repulsed by it.

00:00:49.287 --> 00:00:54.768
So in water-rich environments, 
lipids naturally form a shell like this,

00:00:54.768 --> 00:00:58.308
with the heads outside 
and the tails inside.

00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:03.691
Their shared reaction to water makes 
the lipids stick loosely together—

00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:07.401
this is called the hydrophobic effect.

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:11.758
This outer structure helps the molecular
machinery of the virus

00:01:11.758 --> 00:01:16.052
break through cellular membranes 
and hijack our cells.

00:01:16.052 --> 00:01:19.572
But it has thousands upon thousands 
of weak points

00:01:19.572 --> 00:01:23.182
where the right molecules 
could pry it apart.

00:01:23.182 --> 00:01:26.162
And this is where soap comes in.

00:01:26.162 --> 00:01:31.789
A single drop of any brand of soap 
contains quadrillions of molecules

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:36.351
called amphiphiles, 
which resemble biological lipids.

00:01:36.351 --> 00:01:40.161
Their tails, which are similarly repulsed
by water,

00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:44.590
compete for space with the lipids 
that make up the virus’s shell.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.317
But they’re just different enough to break
up the regularity of the virus’s membrane,

00:01:50.317 --> 00:01:53.567
making the whole thing come crashing down.

00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:58.743
Those amphiphiles then form bubbles 
of their own around particles

00:01:58.743 --> 00:02:02.663
including the virus’s RNA and proteins.

00:02:02.663 --> 00:02:07.572
Apply water, and you’ll wash 
that whole bubble away.

00:02:07.572 --> 00:02:12.820
Hand sanitizers work less like a crowbar, 
and more like an earthquake.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.610
When you surround a coronavirus 
with water,

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.556
the hydrophobic effect gives the bonds 
within the membrane their strength.

00:02:20.556 --> 00:02:24.276
That same effect also holds 
the big proteins

00:02:24.276 --> 00:02:27.936
that form coronavirus’s spikes in place

00:02:27.936 --> 00:02:31.606
and in the shape that enables 
them to infect your cells.

00:02:31.606 --> 00:02:36.088
If you dry the virus out in air, 
it keeps its stability.

00:02:36.088 --> 00:02:40.789
But now surround it 
with a high concentration of an alcohol,

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:45.624
like the ethanol or isopropanol found 
in most hand-sanitizers.

00:02:45.624 --> 00:02:48.354
This makes the hydrophobic 
effect disappear,

00:02:48.354 --> 00:02:51.049
and gives the molecules room 
to move around.

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.525
The overall effect is like removing all 
of the nails and mortar from a house

00:02:56.525 --> 00:02:58.545
and then hitting it with an earthquake.

00:02:58.545 --> 00:03:03.795
The cell’s membrane collapses 
and those spike proteins crumble.

00:03:03.795 --> 00:03:08.175
In either method, the actual process 
of destroying the virus

00:03:08.175 --> 00:03:10.280
happens in just a second or two.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.140
But doctors recommend at least 
20 seconds of hand-washing

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.920
because of the intricate landscape 
that is your hand.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.957
Soap and sanitizer need to get everywhere,
including your palms, fingertips,

00:03:23.957 --> 00:03:27.445
the outsides of your hands, 
and between your fingers,

00:03:27.445 --> 00:03:28.935
to protect you properly.

00:03:28.935 --> 00:03:31.895
And when it comes to a 
coronavirus outbreak,

00:03:31.895 --> 00:03:36.731
doctors recommend washing your hands
with soap and water whenever possible.

00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:40.914
Even though both approaches are similarly 
effective at killing the virus,

00:03:40.914 --> 00:03:43.614
soap and water has two benefits:

00:03:43.614 --> 00:03:48.788
first it washes away any dirt which 
could otherwise hide virus particles.

00:03:48.788 --> 00:03:50.268
But more importantly,

00:03:50.268 --> 00:03:54.415
it’s simply easier to fully cover 
your hands with soap and water

00:03:54.415 --> 00:03:55.795
for 20 seconds.

00:03:55.795 --> 00:04:00.707
Of course, hand sanitizer 
is more convenient to use on the go.

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:05.648
In the absence of a sink, use 
the sanitizer as thoroughly as possible

00:04:05.648 --> 00:04:08.678
and rub your hands together 
until they’re dry.

00:04:08.678 --> 00:04:12.067
Unfortunately, there are billions 
of people

00:04:12.067 --> 00:04:15.037
who don’t have access 
to clean drinking water,

00:04:15.037 --> 00:04:20.364
which is a huge problem at any time
but especially during an outbreak.

00:04:20.364 --> 00:04:25.146
Researchers and aid groups are working to
provide solutions for these communities.

00:04:25.146 --> 00:04:29.980
One example is a device that uses salt,
water, and a car battery

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.980
to make chlorinated water 
that kills harmful pathogens

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.580
and is safe for hand-washing.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.280
So wherever possible, soap and water 
are recommended for a coronavirus,

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.440
but does that mean it's best 
for every viral outbreak?

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.910
Not necessarily.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.540
Many common colds are caused 
by rhinoviruses

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.782
that have a geometric protein structure
called a capsid

00:04:54.782 --> 00:04:57.092
instead of a lipid membrane.

00:04:57.092 --> 00:05:00.232
The capsid doesn't have nearly 
as many weak points

00:05:00.232 --> 00:05:03.116
where soap amphiphiles can pry it apart,

00:05:03.116 --> 00:05:06.116
so it takes longer 
for soap to be effective.

00:05:06.116 --> 00:05:09.806
However some of its surface 
proteins are still vulnerable

00:05:09.806 --> 00:05:13.372
to the destabilizing effect 
of hand sanitizer.

00:05:13.372 --> 00:05:18.131
In this and similar cases, hand sanitizer
may be more effective,

00:05:18.131 --> 00:05:22.671
especially if you then wash 
your hands to remove residual particles.

00:05:22.671 --> 00:05:26.971
The best way to know 
which to use for any given outbreak

00:05:26.971 --> 00:05:31.141
is to do what's best 
for all things illness-related:

00:05:31.141 --> 00:05:35.051
follow the advice 
of accredited medical professionals.
