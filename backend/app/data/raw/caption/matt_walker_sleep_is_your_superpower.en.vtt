00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:14.350
Thank you very much.

00:00:14.374 --> 00:00:18.373
Well, I would like
to start with testicles.

00:00:18.683 --> 00:00:20.293
(Laughter)

00:00:21.198 --> 00:00:23.952
Men who sleep five hours a night

00:00:23.976 --> 00:00:29.229
have significantly smaller testicles
than those who sleep seven hours or more.

00:00:29.253 --> 00:00:32.054
(Laughter)

00:00:32.078 --> 00:00:37.157
In addition, men who routinely sleep
just four to five hours a night

00:00:37.181 --> 00:00:39.697
will have a level of testosterone

00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:43.054
which is that of someone
10 years their senior.

00:00:45.083 --> 00:00:48.844
So a lack of sleep
will age a man by a decade

00:00:48.868 --> 00:00:51.653
in terms of that critical
aspect of wellness.

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:58.363
And we see equivalent impairments
in female reproductive health

00:00:58.387 --> 00:00:59.804
caused by a lack of sleep.

00:01:03.086 --> 00:01:05.737
This is the best news
that I have for you today.

00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:08.437
(Laughter)

00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:10.838
From this point, it may only get worse.

00:01:10.862 --> 00:01:13.642
Not only will I tell you
about the wonderfully good things

00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.501
that happen when you get sleep,

00:01:15.525 --> 00:01:20.006
but the alarmingly bad things
that happen when you don't get enough,

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.561
both for your brain and for your body.

00:01:23.394 --> 00:01:25.808
Let me start with the brain

00:01:25.832 --> 00:01:28.837
and the functions of learning and memory,

00:01:28.861 --> 00:01:32.130
because what we've discovered
over the past 10 or so years

00:01:32.154 --> 00:01:35.051
is that you need sleep after learning

00:01:35.075 --> 00:01:38.362
to essentially hit the save button
on those new memories

00:01:38.386 --> 00:01:39.686
so that you don't forget.

00:01:40.948 --> 00:01:46.464
But recently, we discovered
that you also need sleep before learning

00:01:46.488 --> 00:01:49.559
to actually prepare your brain,

00:01:49.583 --> 00:01:51.639
almost like a dry sponge

00:01:51.663 --> 00:01:54.106
ready to initially soak up
new information.

00:01:55.167 --> 00:01:58.279
And without sleep,
the memory circuits of the brain

00:01:58.303 --> 00:02:01.074
essentially become
waterlogged, as it were,

00:02:01.098 --> 00:02:03.255
and you can't absorb new memories.

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.068
So let me show you the data.

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:10.345
Here in this study, we decided
to test the hypothesis

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.917
that pulling the all-nighter
was a good idea.

00:02:14.244 --> 00:02:16.603
So we took a group of individuals

00:02:16.627 --> 00:02:20.174
and we assigned them
to one of two experimental groups:

00:02:20.198 --> 00:02:23.655
a sleep group
and a sleep deprivation group.

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:28.299
Now the sleep group, they're going to get
a full eight hours of slumber,

00:02:28.323 --> 00:02:30.991
but the deprivation group,
we're going to keep them awake

00:02:31.015 --> 00:02:33.165
in the laboratory, under full supervision.

00:02:33.658 --> 00:02:38.038
There's no naps or caffeine, by the way,
so it's miserable for everyone involved.

00:02:38.586 --> 00:02:40.115
And then the next day,

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:44.439
we're going to place those participants
inside an MRI scanner

00:02:44.463 --> 00:02:48.249
and we're going to have them
try and learn a whole list of new facts

00:02:48.273 --> 00:02:51.572
as we're taking snapshots
of brain activity.

00:02:51.596 --> 00:02:53.575
And then we're going to test them

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.083
to see how effective
that learning has been.

00:02:56.948 --> 00:02:59.884
And that's what you're looking at
here on the vertical axis.

00:03:00.515 --> 00:03:03.195
And when you put
those two groups head to head,

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:08.258
what you find is a quite significant,
40-percent deficit

00:03:08.282 --> 00:03:11.758
in the ability of the brain
to make new memories without sleep.

00:03:13.044 --> 00:03:14.894
I think this should be concerning,

00:03:14.918 --> 00:03:17.140
considering what we know
is happening to sleep

00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:19.583
in our education populations right now.

00:03:20.538 --> 00:03:22.357
In fact, to put that in context,

00:03:22.381 --> 00:03:25.878
it would be the difference
in a child acing an exam

00:03:25.902 --> 00:03:28.802
versus failing it miserably -- 40 percent.

00:03:30.294 --> 00:03:34.490
And we've gone on to discover
what goes wrong within your brain

00:03:34.514 --> 00:03:37.635
to produce these types
of learning disabilities.

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:40.333
And there's a structure that sits

00:03:40.357 --> 00:03:44.989
on the left and the right side
of your brain, called the hippocampus.

00:03:45.013 --> 00:03:46.798
And you can think of the hippocampus

00:03:46.822 --> 00:03:50.059
almost like the informational
inbox of your brain.

00:03:50.634 --> 00:03:53.825
It's very good at receiving
new memory files

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.324
and then holding on to them.

00:03:56.931 --> 00:03:58.642
And when you look at this structure

00:03:58.666 --> 00:04:01.728
in those people who'd had
a full night of sleep,

00:04:01.752 --> 00:04:05.277
we saw lots of healthy
learning-related activity.

00:04:06.644 --> 00:04:09.603
Yet in those people
who were sleep-deprived,

00:04:09.627 --> 00:04:13.253
we actually couldn't find
any significant signal whatsoever.

00:04:14.732 --> 00:04:19.713
So it's almost as though sleep deprivation
had shut down your memory inbox,

00:04:19.737 --> 00:04:22.713
and any new incoming files --
they were just being bounced.

00:04:23.898 --> 00:04:27.506
You couldn't effectively
commit new experiences to memory.

00:04:30.062 --> 00:04:34.561
So that's the bad that can happen
if I were to take sleep away from you,

00:04:34.585 --> 00:04:37.657
but let me just come back
to that control group for a second.

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:41.776
Do you remember those folks
that got a full eight hours of sleep?

00:04:42.418 --> 00:04:44.894
Well, we can ask
a very different question:

00:04:44.918 --> 00:04:48.522
What is it about the physiological
quality of your sleep

00:04:48.546 --> 00:04:50.093
when you do get it

00:04:50.117 --> 00:04:53.929
that restores and enhances
your memory and learning ability

00:04:53.953 --> 00:04:55.103
each and every day?

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:58.986
And by placing electrodes
all over the head,

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.057
what we've discovered
is that there are big, powerful brainwaves

00:05:03.081 --> 00:05:06.700
that happen during
the very deepest stages of sleep

00:05:06.724 --> 00:05:09.009
that have riding on top of them

00:05:09.033 --> 00:05:12.307
these spectacular bursts
of electrical activity

00:05:12.331 --> 00:05:14.065
that we call sleep spindles.

00:05:15.066 --> 00:05:19.488
And it's the combined quality
of these deep-sleep brainwaves

00:05:19.512 --> 00:05:23.973
that acts like a file-transfer
mechanism at night,

00:05:23.997 --> 00:05:28.068
shifting memories from a short-term
vulnerable reservoir

00:05:28.092 --> 00:05:32.434
to a more permanent long-term
storage site within the brain,

00:05:32.458 --> 00:05:35.848
and therefore protecting them,
making them safe.

00:05:37.467 --> 00:05:39.506
And it is important that we understand

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.589
what during sleep actually transacts
these memory benefits,

00:05:44.613 --> 00:05:48.747
because there are real medical
and societal implications.

00:05:48.771 --> 00:05:50.788
And let me just tell you about one area

00:05:50.812 --> 00:05:54.248
that we've moved this work
out into, clinically,

00:05:54.272 --> 00:05:57.485
which is the context of aging
and dementia.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.295
Because it's of course no secret
that, as we get older,

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:05.604
our learning and memory abilities
begin to fade and decline.

00:06:07.051 --> 00:06:08.669
But what we've also discovered

00:06:08.693 --> 00:06:15.478
is that a physiological signature of aging
is that your sleep gets worse,

00:06:15.502 --> 00:06:19.306
especially that deep quality of sleep
that I was just discussing.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.734
And only last year,
we finally published evidence

00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:26.717
that these two things,
they're not simply co-occurring,

00:06:26.741 --> 00:06:29.559
they are significantly interrelated.

00:06:30.837 --> 00:06:34.124
And it suggests
that the disruption of deep sleep

00:06:34.148 --> 00:06:36.442
is an underappreciated factor

00:06:36.466 --> 00:06:40.379
that is contributing
to cognitive decline or memory decline

00:06:40.403 --> 00:06:43.981
in aging, and most recently
we've discovered,

00:06:44.005 --> 00:06:46.227
in Alzheimer's disease as well.

00:06:48.329 --> 00:06:52.068
Now, I know this is remarkably
depressing news.

00:06:52.092 --> 00:06:54.395
It's in the mail. It's coming at you.

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:56.704
But there's a potential
silver lining here.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.618
Unlike many of the other factors
that we know are associated with aging,

00:07:02.642 --> 00:07:06.301
for example changes
in the physical structure of the brain,

00:07:06.325 --> 00:07:09.387
that's fiendishly difficult to treat.

00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:13.967
But that sleep is a missing piece
in the explanatory puzzle

00:07:13.991 --> 00:07:16.586
of aging and Alzheimer's is exciting

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.348
because we may be able
to do something about it.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:24.461
And one way that we are
approaching this at my sleep center

00:07:24.485 --> 00:07:27.493
is not by using
sleeping pills, by the way.

00:07:27.517 --> 00:07:32.446
Unfortunately, they are blunt instruments
that do not produce naturalistic sleep.

00:07:33.532 --> 00:07:36.779
Instead, we're actually developing
a method based on this.

00:07:36.803 --> 00:07:40.018
It's called direct current
brain stimulation.

00:07:40.042 --> 00:07:43.323
You insert a small amount
of voltage into the brain,

00:07:43.347 --> 00:07:45.585
so small you typically don't feel it,

00:07:45.609 --> 00:07:47.501
but it has a measurable impact.

00:07:48.826 --> 00:07:55.167
Now if you apply this stimulation
during sleep in young, healthy adults,

00:07:55.191 --> 00:07:59.906
as if you're sort of singing in time
with those deep-sleep brainwaves,

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:04.472
not only can you amplify
the size of those deep-sleep brainwaves,

00:08:04.496 --> 00:08:09.040
but in doing so, we can almost
double the amount of memory benefit

00:08:09.064 --> 00:08:11.098
that you get from sleep.

00:08:11.122 --> 00:08:13.937
The question now
is whether we can translate

00:08:13.961 --> 00:08:18.262
this same affordable,
potentially portable piece of technology

00:08:18.286 --> 00:08:21.167
into older adults and those with dementia.

00:08:22.726 --> 00:08:27.312
Can we restore back
some healthy quality of deep sleep,

00:08:27.336 --> 00:08:31.955
and in doing so, can we salvage
aspects of their learning

00:08:31.979 --> 00:08:33.463
and memory function?

00:08:33.487 --> 00:08:35.653
That is my real hope now.

00:08:36.378 --> 00:08:39.383
That's one of our moon-shot
goals, as it were.

00:08:41.335 --> 00:08:44.693
So that's an example
of sleep for your brain,

00:08:44.717 --> 00:08:47.930
but sleep is just
as essential for your body.

00:08:49.276 --> 00:08:52.951
We've already spoken about sleep loss
and your reproductive system.

00:08:53.863 --> 00:08:58.725
Or I could tell you about sleep loss
and your cardiovascular system,

00:08:58.749 --> 00:09:01.923
and that all it takes is one hour.

00:09:01.947 --> 00:09:07.455
Because there is a global experiment
performed on 1.6 billion people

00:09:07.479 --> 00:09:11.756
across 70 countries twice a year,

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.669
and it's called daylight saving time.

00:09:14.907 --> 00:09:18.365
Now, in the spring,
when we lose one hour of sleep,

00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:24.008
we see a subsequent 24-percent increase
in heart attacks that following day.

00:09:26.952 --> 00:09:30.127
In the autumn,
when we gain an hour of sleep,

00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:34.019
we see a 21-percent
reduction in heart attacks.

00:09:35.752 --> 00:09:37.432
Isn't that incredible?

00:09:38.929 --> 00:09:44.605
And you see exactly the same profile
for car crashes, road traffic accidents,

00:09:44.629 --> 00:09:46.531
even suicide rates.

00:09:48.928 --> 00:09:51.833
But as a deeper dive,
I want to focus on this:

00:09:51.857 --> 00:09:54.348
sleep loss and your immune system.

00:09:55.149 --> 00:09:59.991
And here, I'll introduce these delightful
blue elements in the image.

00:10:00.015 --> 00:10:03.193
They are called natural killer cells,

00:10:03.217 --> 00:10:08.067
and you can think of natural killer cells
almost like the secret service agents

00:10:08.091 --> 00:10:09.702
of your immune system.

00:10:09.726 --> 00:10:14.709
They are very good at identifying
dangerous, unwanted elements

00:10:14.733 --> 00:10:16.130
and eliminating them.

00:10:17.253 --> 00:10:21.197
In fact, what they're doing here
is destroying a cancerous tumor mass.

00:10:22.586 --> 00:10:28.522
So what you wish for
is a virile set of these immune assassins

00:10:28.546 --> 00:10:30.602
at all times,

00:10:30.626 --> 00:10:34.436
and tragically, that's what you don't have
if you're not sleeping enough.

00:10:35.825 --> 00:10:37.469
So here in this experiment,

00:10:37.493 --> 00:10:41.322
you're not going to have your sleep
deprived for an entire night,

00:10:41.346 --> 00:10:44.857
you're simply going to have your sleep
restricted to four hours

00:10:44.881 --> 00:10:46.659
for one single night,

00:10:46.683 --> 00:10:49.684
and then we're going to look to see
what's the percent reduction

00:10:49.708 --> 00:10:51.698
in immune cell activity that you suffer.

00:10:52.774 --> 00:10:55.603
And it's not small -- it's not 10 percent,

00:10:55.627 --> 00:10:57.630
it's not 20 percent.

00:10:57.654 --> 00:11:02.226
There was a 70-percent drop
in natural killer cell activity.

00:11:03.786 --> 00:11:07.841
That's a concerning state
of immune deficiency,

00:11:09.358 --> 00:11:12.175
and you can perhaps understand
why we're now finding

00:11:12.199 --> 00:11:16.055
significant links between
short sleep duration

00:11:16.079 --> 00:11:19.992
and your risk for the development
of numerous forms of cancer.

00:11:21.892 --> 00:11:24.675
Currently, that list includes
cancer of the bowel,

00:11:24.699 --> 00:11:27.961
cancer of the prostate
and cancer of the breast.

00:11:29.853 --> 00:11:35.209
In fact, the link between a lack of sleep
and cancer is now so strong

00:11:35.233 --> 00:11:37.615
that the World Health Organization

00:11:37.639 --> 00:11:41.829
has classified any form
of nighttime shift work

00:11:41.853 --> 00:11:45.035
as a probable carcinogen,

00:11:45.059 --> 00:11:47.726
because of a disruption
of your sleep-wake rhythms.

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:52.560
So you may have heard of that old maxim

00:11:52.584 --> 00:11:54.696
that you can sleep when you're dead.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.790
Well, I'm being quite serious now --

00:11:56.814 --> 00:11:59.425
it is mortally unwise advice.

00:12:00.375 --> 00:12:05.412
We know this from epidemiological studies
across millions of individuals.

00:12:05.436 --> 00:12:07.417
There's a simple truth:

00:12:07.441 --> 00:12:10.845
the shorter your sleep,
the shorter your life.

00:12:10.869 --> 00:12:14.424
Short sleep predicts all-cause mortality.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:21.109
And if increasing your risk
for the development of cancer

00:12:21.133 --> 00:12:23.377
or even Alzheimer's disease

00:12:23.401 --> 00:12:27.577
were not sufficiently disquieting,

00:12:27.601 --> 00:12:31.299
we have since discovered
that a lack of sleep will even erode

00:12:31.323 --> 00:12:35.396
the very fabric of biological life itself,

00:12:36.681 --> 00:12:38.673
your DNA genetic code.

00:12:40.038 --> 00:12:43.974
So here in this study,
they took a group of healthy adults

00:12:43.998 --> 00:12:47.737
and they limited them
to six hours of sleep a night

00:12:47.761 --> 00:12:49.412
for one week,

00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:53.233
and then they measured the change
in their gene activity profile

00:12:53.257 --> 00:12:55.701
relative to when those same individuals

00:12:55.725 --> 00:12:58.272
were getting a full eight hours
of sleep a night.

00:12:59.451 --> 00:13:01.267
And there were two critical findings.

00:13:02.204 --> 00:13:07.275
First, a sizable and significant 711 genes

00:13:07.299 --> 00:13:09.627
were distorted in their activity,

00:13:09.651 --> 00:13:11.094
caused by a lack of sleep.

00:13:11.923 --> 00:13:15.050
The second result
was that about half of those genes

00:13:15.074 --> 00:13:17.517
were actually increased in their activity.

00:13:17.842 --> 00:13:19.771
The other half were decreased.

00:13:20.448 --> 00:13:23.729
Now those genes that were switched off
by a lack of sleep

00:13:23.753 --> 00:13:27.242
were genes associated
with your immune system,

00:13:27.266 --> 00:13:30.106
so once again, you can see
that immune deficiency.

00:13:31.348 --> 00:13:34.421
In contrast, those genes
that were actually upregulated

00:13:34.445 --> 00:13:36.817
or increased by way of a lack of sleep,

00:13:36.841 --> 00:13:40.739
were genes associated
with the promotion of tumors,

00:13:40.763 --> 00:13:45.914
genes associated with long-term
chronic inflammation within the body,

00:13:45.938 --> 00:13:48.740
and genes associated with stress,

00:13:48.764 --> 00:13:51.793
and, as a consequence,
cardiovascular disease.

00:13:53.171 --> 00:13:56.831
There is simply no aspect of your wellness

00:13:56.855 --> 00:14:00.122
that can retreat at the sign
of sleep deprivation

00:14:00.146 --> 00:14:01.960
and get away unscathed.

00:14:02.912 --> 00:14:05.920
It's rather like a broken
water pipe in your home.

00:14:05.944 --> 00:14:09.587
Sleep loss will leak down
into every nook and cranny

00:14:09.611 --> 00:14:11.997
of your physiology,

00:14:12.021 --> 00:14:15.926
even tampering with
the very DNA nucleic alphabet

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.790
that spells out
your daily health narrative.

00:14:21.866 --> 00:14:24.549
And at this point, you may be thinking,

00:14:24.573 --> 00:14:27.105
"Oh my goodness,
how do I start to get better sleep?

00:14:27.129 --> 00:14:29.374
What are you tips for good sleep?"

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:34.558
Well, beyond avoiding
the damaging and harmful impact

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:37.501
of alcohol and caffeine on sleep,

00:14:37.525 --> 00:14:39.962
and if you're struggling
with sleep at night,

00:14:39.986 --> 00:14:42.167
avoiding naps during the day,

00:14:42.191 --> 00:14:44.334
I have two pieces of advice for you.

00:14:45.104 --> 00:14:47.918
The first is regularity.

00:14:47.942 --> 00:14:51.343
Go to bed at the same time,
wake up at the same time,

00:14:51.367 --> 00:14:54.428
no matter whether
it's the weekday or the weekend.

00:14:54.452 --> 00:14:57.197
Regularity is king,

00:14:57.221 --> 00:14:59.182
and it will anchor your sleep

00:14:59.206 --> 00:15:02.518
and improve the quantity
and the quality of that sleep.

00:15:04.372 --> 00:15:07.054
The second is keep it cool.

00:15:08.088 --> 00:15:10.515
Your body needs to drop
its core temperature

00:15:10.539 --> 00:15:14.752
by about two to three degrees
Fahrenheit to initiate sleep

00:15:14.776 --> 00:15:16.856
and then to stay asleep,

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.372
and it's the reason
you will always find it easier

00:15:19.396 --> 00:15:21.777
to fall asleep in a room that's too cold

00:15:21.801 --> 00:15:23.045
than too hot.

00:15:24.013 --> 00:15:27.529
So aim for a bedroom temperature
of around 65 degrees,

00:15:27.553 --> 00:15:29.507
or about 18 degrees Celsius.

00:15:29.531 --> 00:15:32.298
That's going to be optimal
for the sleep of most people.

00:15:34.446 --> 00:15:37.943
And then finally,
in taking a step back, then,

00:15:37.967 --> 00:15:41.160
what is the mission-critical
statement here?

00:15:42.771 --> 00:15:44.987
Well, I think it may be this:

00:15:45.011 --> 00:15:50.283
sleep, unfortunately,
is not an optional lifestyle luxury.

00:15:51.105 --> 00:15:55.652
Sleep is a nonnegotiable
biological necessity.

00:15:56.892 --> 00:16:00.483
It is your life-support system,

00:16:00.507 --> 00:16:05.141
and it is Mother Nature's
best effort yet at immortality.

00:16:06.709 --> 00:16:11.225
And the decimation of sleep
throughout industrialized nations

00:16:11.249 --> 00:16:16.466
is having a catastrophic impact
on our health, our wellness,

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:19.156
even the safety and the education
of our children.

00:16:20.323 --> 00:16:23.339
It's a silent sleep loss epidemic,

00:16:23.363 --> 00:16:26.728
and it's fast becoming one of the greatest
public health challenges

00:16:26.752 --> 00:16:29.474
that we face in the 21st century.

00:16:32.294 --> 00:16:37.377
I believe it is now time for us
to reclaim our right

00:16:37.401 --> 00:16:38.872
to a full night of sleep,

00:16:40.012 --> 00:16:42.169
and without embarrassment

00:16:42.193 --> 00:16:45.592
or that unfortunate stigma of laziness.

00:16:46.638 --> 00:16:52.622
And in doing so, we can be reunited
with the most powerful elixir of life,

00:16:54.038 --> 00:16:56.741
the Swiss Army knife
of health, as it were.

00:16:58.667 --> 00:17:01.311
And with that soapbox rant over,

00:17:01.335 --> 00:17:03.430
I will simply say, good night, good luck,

00:17:03.454 --> 00:17:04.604
and above all ...

00:17:06.889 --> 00:17:08.651
I do hope you sleep well.

00:17:08.675 --> 00:17:10.033
Thank you very much indeed.

00:17:10.057 --> 00:17:14.588
(Applause)

00:17:14.612 --> 00:17:15.770
Thank you.

00:17:15.794 --> 00:17:18.636
(Applause)

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.203
Thank you so much.

00:17:20.227 --> 00:17:22.970
David Biello: No, no, no.
Stay there for a second.

00:17:22.994 --> 00:17:25.546
Good job not running away, though.
I appreciate that.

00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:26.814
So that was terrifying.

00:17:26.838 --> 00:17:29.934
Matt Walker: You're welcome.
DB: Yes, thank you, thank you.

00:17:30.314 --> 00:17:35.490
Since we can't catch up on sleep,
what are we supposed to do?

00:17:35.514 --> 00:17:39.046
What do we do when we're, like,
tossing and turning in bed late at night

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:42.132
or doing shift work or whatever else?

00:17:42.156 --> 00:17:44.497
MW: So you're right,
we can't catch up on sleep.

00:17:44.521 --> 00:17:45.846
Sleep is not like the bank.

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.910
You can't accumulate a debt

00:17:47.934 --> 00:17:50.626
and then hope to pay it off
at a later point in time.

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:53.794
I should also note the reason
that it's so catastrophic

00:17:53.818 --> 00:17:56.872
and that our health
deteriorates so quickly,

00:17:56.896 --> 00:17:59.633
first, it's because human beings
are the only species

00:17:59.657 --> 00:18:02.135
that deliberately deprive
themselves of sleep

00:18:02.159 --> 00:18:04.548
for no apparent reason.

00:18:04.572 --> 00:18:05.724
DB: Because we're smart.

00:18:05.748 --> 00:18:10.573
MW: And I make that point
because it means that Mother Nature,

00:18:10.597 --> 00:18:12.287
throughout the course of evolution,

00:18:12.311 --> 00:18:16.614
has never had to face the challenge
of this thing called sleep deprivation.

00:18:17.295 --> 00:18:20.707
So she's never developed a safety net,

00:18:20.731 --> 00:18:22.859
and that's why when you undersleep,

00:18:22.883 --> 00:18:27.217
things just sort of implode so quickly,
both within the brain and the body.

00:18:27.241 --> 00:18:30.014
So you just have to prioritize.

00:18:30.038 --> 00:18:33.340
DB: OK, but tossing and turning in bed,

00:18:33.364 --> 00:18:34.775
what do I do?

00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:39.418
MW: So if you are staying in bed
awake for too long,

00:18:39.442 --> 00:18:42.695
you should get out of bed
and go to a different room

00:18:42.719 --> 00:18:44.032
and do something different.

00:18:44.056 --> 00:18:48.377
The reason is because your brain
will very quickly associate your bedroom

00:18:48.401 --> 00:18:50.720
with the place of wakefulness,

00:18:50.744 --> 00:18:53.433
and you need to break that association.

00:18:53.457 --> 00:18:56.354
So only return to bed when you are sleepy,

00:18:56.378 --> 00:18:59.917
and that way you will relearn
the association that you once had,

00:18:59.941 --> 00:19:02.449
which is your bed is the place of sleep.

00:19:02.473 --> 00:19:04.132
So the analogy would be,

00:19:04.156 --> 00:19:07.732
you'd never sit at the dinner table,
waiting to get hungry,

00:19:07.756 --> 00:19:10.719
so why would you lie in bed,
waiting to get sleepy?

00:19:11.548 --> 00:19:13.548
DB: Well, thank you for that wake-up call.

00:19:13.572 --> 00:19:14.741
Great job, Matt.

00:19:14.765 --> 00:19:16.961
MW: You're very welcome.
Thank you very much.
