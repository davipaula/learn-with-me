00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:15.515
"Will the blight end the chestnut?

00:00:15.857 --> 00:00:17.857
The farmers rather guess not.

00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:20.119
It keeps smouldering at the roots

00:00:20.143 --> 00:00:22.151
And sending up new shoots

00:00:22.175 --> 00:00:23.841
Till another parasite

00:00:23.865 --> 00:00:26.269
Shall come to end the blight."

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.549
At the beginning of the 20th century,

00:00:30.573 --> 00:00:35.220
the eastern American chestnut population,
counting nearly four billion trees,

00:00:35.244 --> 00:00:38.345
was completely decimated
by a fungal infection.

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:41.577
Fungi are the most destructive
pathogens of plants,

00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:44.323
including crops of major
economic importance.

00:00:44.673 --> 00:00:46.234
Can you imagine that today,

00:00:46.258 --> 00:00:49.125
crop losses associated
with fungal infection

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.065
are estimated at billions of dollars
per year, worldwide?

00:00:53.585 --> 00:00:57.283
That represents enough food calories
to feed half a billion people.

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:59.967
And this leads to severe repercussions,

00:00:59.991 --> 00:01:03.411
including episodes of famine
in developing countries,

00:01:03.435 --> 00:01:06.839
large reduction of income
for farmers and distributors,

00:01:06.863 --> 00:01:08.791
high prices for consumers

00:01:08.815 --> 00:01:13.539
and risk of exposure to mycotoxin,
poison produced by fungi.

00:01:14.318 --> 00:01:15.580
The problems that we face

00:01:15.604 --> 00:01:18.321
is that the current method
used to prevent and treat

00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:19.887
those dreadful diseases,

00:01:19.911 --> 00:01:24.220
such as genetic control,
exploiting natural sources of resistance,

00:01:24.244 --> 00:01:27.625
crop rotation or seed
treatment, among others,

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.331
are still limited or ephemeral.

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:33.299
They have to be constantly renewed.

00:01:33.323 --> 00:01:37.577
Therefore, we urgently need
to develop more efficient strategies

00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:42.720
and for this, research is required
to identify biological mechanisms

00:01:42.744 --> 00:01:46.410
that can be targeted
by novel antifungal treatments.

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:52.663
One feature of fungi
is that they cannot move

00:01:52.687 --> 00:01:56.212
and only grow by extension
to form a sophisticated network,

00:01:56.236 --> 00:01:57.386
the mycelium.

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:02.537
In 1884, Anton de Bary,
the father of plant pathology,

00:02:02.561 --> 00:02:06.117
was the first to presume
that fungi are guided by signals

00:02:06.141 --> 00:02:08.077
sent out from the host plant,

00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:12.235
meaning a plant upon which
it can lodge and subsist,

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:14.617
so signals act as a lighthouse

00:02:14.641 --> 00:02:19.807
for fungi to locate, grow toward, reach

00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:23.037
and finally invade and colonize a plant.

00:02:23.427 --> 00:02:26.373
He knew that the identification
of such signals

00:02:26.397 --> 00:02:31.022
would unlock a great knowledge
that then serves to elaborate strategy

00:02:31.046 --> 00:02:34.426
to block the interaction
between the fungus and the plant.

00:02:34.752 --> 00:02:38.172
However, the lack of an appropriate
method at that moment

00:02:38.196 --> 00:02:43.093
prevented him from identifying
this mechanism at the molecular level.

00:02:45.323 --> 00:02:48.450
Using purification and mutational
genomic approaches,

00:02:48.474 --> 00:02:49.998
as well as a technique

00:02:50.022 --> 00:02:53.355
allowing the measurement
of directed hyphal growth,

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.744
today I'm glad to tell you
that after 130 years,

00:02:57.768 --> 00:03:02.592
my former team and I
could finally identify such plant signals

00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:05.973
by studying the interaction
between a pathogenic fungus

00:03:05.997 --> 00:03:07.680
called Fusarium oxysporum

00:03:07.704 --> 00:03:10.878
and one of its host plants,
the tomato plant.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.061
As well, we could characterize

00:03:14.085 --> 00:03:17.000
the fungal receptor
receiving those signals

00:03:17.024 --> 00:03:20.720
and part of the underlying reaction
occurring within the fungus

00:03:20.744 --> 00:03:23.963
and leading to its direct growth
toward the plant.

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.553
(Applause)

00:03:27.577 --> 00:03:28.728
Thank you.

00:03:28.752 --> 00:03:30.006
(Applause)

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.793
The understanding
of such molecular processes

00:03:32.817 --> 00:03:35.315
offers a panel of potential molecules

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:39.139
that can be used to create
novel antifungal treatments.

00:03:39.606 --> 00:03:42.002
And those treatments would disrupt

00:03:42.026 --> 00:03:44.765
the interaction between
the fungus and the plant

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:47.487
either by blocking the plant signal

00:03:47.511 --> 00:03:51.852
or the fungal reception system
which receives those signals.

00:03:51.876 --> 00:03:55.042
Fungal infections have devastated
agriculture crops.

00:03:55.066 --> 00:03:57.788
Moreover, we are now in an era

00:03:57.812 --> 00:04:01.363
where the demand of crop production
is increasing significantly.

00:04:01.387 --> 00:04:05.252
And this is due to population growth,
economic development,

00:04:05.276 --> 00:04:07.942
climate change and demand for bio fuels.

00:04:08.751 --> 00:04:11.823
Our understanding
of the molecular mechanism

00:04:11.847 --> 00:04:14.879
of interaction between
a fungus and its host plant,

00:04:14.903 --> 00:04:16.609
such as the tomato plant,

00:04:16.633 --> 00:04:21.974
potentially represents a major step
towards developing more efficient strategy

00:04:21.998 --> 00:04:24.369
to combat plant fungal diseases

00:04:24.393 --> 00:04:27.918
and therefore solving of problems
that affect people's lives,

00:04:27.942 --> 00:04:30.394
food security and economic growth.

00:04:30.418 --> 00:04:31.570
Thank you.

00:04:31.594 --> 00:04:35.500
(Applause)
