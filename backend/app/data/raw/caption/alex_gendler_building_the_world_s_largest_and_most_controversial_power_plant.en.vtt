00:00:06.765 --> 00:00:11.210
In 2018, a single power plant 
produced more energy

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.042
than the world’s largest coal-powered
and gas-powered plants combined.

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:18.891
And rather than using finite fossil fuels,

00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:24.806
this massively powerful plant relied on
a time-tested source of renewable energy:

00:00:24.806 --> 00:00:26.306
running water.

00:00:26.306 --> 00:00:28.813
Stretching over 2.3 kilometers,

00:00:28.813 --> 00:00:33.950
China’s Three Gorges Dam isn’t just 
the world’s largest hydroelectric plant.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.475
It’s capable of producing more energy
than any other power plant on Earth.

00:00:39.475 --> 00:00:43.475
So what allows Three Gorges 
to generate all this power?

00:00:43.475 --> 00:00:47.664
And how do hydroelectric plants
work in the first place?

00:00:47.664 --> 00:00:51.574
A hydroelectric dam is essentially 
a massive gate,

00:00:51.574 --> 00:00:57.244
which redirects a river’s natural flow
through a large pipe called a penstock.

00:00:57.244 --> 00:01:01.944
Rushing water flows through the penstock
and turns the blades of a turbine,

00:01:01.944 --> 00:01:06.000
which is attached to a generator
in an adjacent power station.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.169
The turning of the blades spins coils
of wire inside a magnetic field,

00:01:11.169 --> 00:01:14.344
producing a steady supply of electricity.

00:01:14.344 --> 00:01:17.634
Because the penstocks can be sealed
at any time,

00:01:17.634 --> 00:01:21.855
a dam can hold back excess water
during stormy seasons,

00:01:21.855 --> 00:01:23.925
and save it for dry ones.

00:01:23.925 --> 00:01:27.305
This allows hydroelectric dams 
to produce power

00:01:27.305 --> 00:01:29.105
regardless of the weather,

00:01:29.105 --> 00:01:33.309
while simultaneously preventing
floods further downstream.

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:37.519
These benefits have long appealed 
to China’s Hubei Province.

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:40.299
Located near the basin
of the Yangtze River,

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.299
this region is prone to deadly floods
during rainy seasons

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.069
when the Yangtze’s flow is strongest.

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.182
Plans to build a dam that would
transform this volatile waterway

00:01:51.182 --> 00:01:56.071
into a stable source of power circulated
throughout the 20th century.

00:01:56.071 --> 00:02:01.574
When construction finally began in 1994
the plans were epic.

00:02:01.574 --> 00:02:07.232
The dam would contain 32 turbines—
12 more than the previous record holder,

00:02:07.232 --> 00:02:09.522
South America’s Itaipu Dam.

00:02:09.522 --> 00:02:13.728
The turbines would supply energy 
to two separate power stations,

00:02:13.728 --> 00:02:18.914
each connecting to a series of cables
spanning hundreds of kilometers.

00:02:18.914 --> 00:02:24.973
Electricity from Three Gorges would
reach power grids as far away as Shanghai.

00:02:24.973 --> 00:02:28.973
However, the human costs 
of this ambition were steep.

00:02:28.973 --> 00:02:30.993
To create the dam’s reservoir,

00:02:30.993 --> 00:02:36.540
workers needed to flood over 
600 square kilometers of land upstream.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.103
This area included 13 cities, 
hundreds of villages,

00:02:41.103 --> 00:02:45.563
and over 1,000 historical
and archaeological sites.

00:02:45.563 --> 00:02:49.613
The construction displaced roughly
1.4 million people,

00:02:49.613 --> 00:02:54.297
and the government’s relocation programs
were widely considered insufficient.

00:02:54.297 --> 00:02:57.537
Many argued against this controversial
construction,

00:02:57.537 --> 00:03:02.007
but others estimated that the lives
saved by the dam’s flood protection

00:03:02.007 --> 00:03:04.977
would outweigh the trauma 
of displacement.

00:03:04.977 --> 00:03:08.057
Furthermore, raising the water level
upstream

00:03:08.057 --> 00:03:10.267
would improve the river’s navigability,

00:03:10.267 --> 00:03:13.447
increase shipping capacity,
and transform the region

00:03:13.447 --> 00:03:16.897
into a collection 
of prosperous port towns.

00:03:16.897 --> 00:03:19.928
When the project was completed in 2012,

00:03:19.928 --> 00:03:23.708
China became the world’s largest
producer of electricity.

00:03:23.708 --> 00:03:29.742
In 2018, the dam generated 101.6 billion
kilowatt-hours.

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:34.454
That’s enough electricity to power 
nearly 2% of China for one year;

00:03:34.454 --> 00:03:38.454
or to power New York City 
for almost two years.

00:03:38.454 --> 00:03:41.394
This is a truly astonishing amount
of energy.

00:03:41.394 --> 00:03:45.727
And yet, two years earlier, 
another dam less than half the size

00:03:45.727 --> 00:03:48.427
actually generated more electricity.

00:03:48.427 --> 00:03:54.859
Despite Three Gorges record-setting scale,
the Itaipu Dam still produced more power.

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.509
To understand why Itaipu can outperform
Three Gorges,

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:03.149
we need to look at the two factors
that determine a dam’s energy output.

00:04:03.152 --> 00:04:05.962
The first is the number of turbines.

00:04:05.962 --> 00:04:10.312
Three Gorges has the world’s highest
installed turbine capacity,

00:04:10.312 --> 00:04:15.416
meaning it’s theoretically capable 
of producing over 50% more power

00:04:15.416 --> 00:04:16.806
than Itaipu.

00:04:16.806 --> 00:04:20.806
But the second factor is the force 
and frequency of water

00:04:20.806 --> 00:04:22.806
moving through those turbines.

00:04:22.806 --> 00:04:28.540
Three Gorges spans several deep, narrow
ravines surging with powerful water.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.922
However, the Yangtze’s seasonal changes
keep the dam from reaching

00:04:32.922 --> 00:04:35.642
its theoretical maximum output.

00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:37.872
The Itaipu Dam, on the other hand,

00:04:37.872 --> 00:04:43.783
is located atop what was previously
the planet’s largest waterfall by volume.

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:47.383
Although the dam’s construction destroyed
this natural wonder,

00:04:47.383 --> 00:04:50.659
the constant flow of water allows Itaipu

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:54.509
to consistently generate more
power each year.

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:57.259
This dam rivalry is far from over,

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:02.097
and other projects like the Inga Falls Dam
in the Democratic Republic of Congo

00:05:02.097 --> 00:05:06.289
are also vying for the title 
of most powerful power plant.

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.059
But whatever the future holds,
governments will need to ensure

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:13.569
that a power plant’s environmental
and human impact

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:16.789
are as sustainable as the energy
it produces.
