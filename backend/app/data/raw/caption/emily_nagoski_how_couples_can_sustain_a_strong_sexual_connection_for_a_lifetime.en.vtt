00:00:12.951 --> 00:00:15.198
I'm sitting in a bar
with a couple of friends --

00:00:15.222 --> 00:00:16.962
literally, a couple, married couple.

00:00:16.986 --> 00:00:19.410
They're the parents of two young children,

00:00:19.434 --> 00:00:21.422
seven academic degrees between them,

00:00:21.446 --> 00:00:25.639
big nerds, really nice people
but very sleep-deprived.

00:00:25.663 --> 00:00:31.182
And they ask me the question
I get asked more than any other question.

00:00:31.206 --> 00:00:33.827
They go, "So, Emily,

00:00:33.851 --> 00:00:39.348
how do couples, you know,
sustain a strong sexual connection

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:41.093
over multiple decades?"

00:00:42.162 --> 00:00:45.575
I'm a sex educator, which is why
my friends ask me questions like this,

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:48.003
and I am also a big nerd like my friends.

00:00:48.027 --> 00:00:52.059
I love science, which is why
I can give them something like an answer.

00:00:52.083 --> 00:00:54.509
Research actually has
pretty solid evidence

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.059
that couples who sustain
strong sexual connections

00:00:57.083 --> 00:00:58.820
over multiple decades

00:00:58.844 --> 00:01:00.797
have two things in common.

00:01:01.414 --> 00:01:04.030
Before I can tell my friends
what those two things are,

00:01:04.054 --> 00:01:06.490
I have to tell them a few things
that they are not.

00:01:06.514 --> 00:01:10.179
These are not couples
who have sex very often.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.717
Almost none of us have sex very often.

00:01:14.322 --> 00:01:15.597
We are busy.

00:01:16.318 --> 00:01:19.906
They are also not couples who necessarily
have wild, adventurous sex.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.520
One recent study actually found

00:01:21.544 --> 00:01:25.097
that the couples
who are most strongly predicted

00:01:25.121 --> 00:01:29.238
to have strong sexual
and relationship satisfaction,

00:01:29.262 --> 00:01:30.624
the best predictor of that

00:01:30.648 --> 00:01:32.621
is not what kind of sex they have

00:01:32.645 --> 00:01:34.295
or how often or where they have it

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:36.906
but whether they cuddle after sex.

00:01:37.906 --> 00:01:39.702
And they are not necessarily couples

00:01:39.726 --> 00:01:42.642
who constantly can't wait
to keep their hands off each other.

00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:43.879
Some of them are.

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:47.276
They experience what the researchers
call "spontaneous desire,"

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.734
that just sort of seems
to appear out of the blue.

00:01:49.758 --> 00:01:52.234
Erika Moen, the cartoonist
who illustrated my book,

00:01:52.258 --> 00:01:56.823
draws spontaneous desire
as a lightning bolt to the genitals --

00:01:56.847 --> 00:01:59.632
kaboom! -- you just want it
out of the blue.

00:01:59.656 --> 00:02:03.854
That is absolutely one normal,
healthy way to experience sexual desire.

00:02:03.878 --> 00:02:06.916
But there's another healthy way
to experience sexual desire.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.208
It's called "responsive desire."

00:02:09.232 --> 00:02:14.211
Where spontaneous desire seems
to emerge in anticipation of pleasure,

00:02:14.235 --> 00:02:18.443
responsive desire emerges
in response to pleasure.

00:02:18.467 --> 00:02:21.236
There's a sex therapist in New Jersey
named Christine Hyde,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.155
who taught me this great metaphor
she uses with her clients.

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:27.553
She says, imagine that your best friend
invites you to a party.

00:02:27.577 --> 00:02:31.680
You say yes because
it's your best friend and a party.

00:02:31.704 --> 00:02:34.295
But then, as the date approaches,
you start thinking,

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.740
"Aw, there's going to be all this traffic.

00:02:36.764 --> 00:02:38.554
We have to find child care.

00:02:38.578 --> 00:02:41.063
Am I really going to want
to put my party clothes on

00:02:41.087 --> 00:02:42.916
and get there at the end of the week?"

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.375
But you put on your party clothes
and you show up to the party,

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:47.570
and what happens?

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.838
You have a good time at the party.

00:02:49.862 --> 00:02:52.066
If you are having fun at the party,

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.706
you are doing it right.

00:02:54.147 --> 00:02:57.009
When it comes to a sexual connection,
it's the same thing.

00:02:57.033 --> 00:02:58.669
You put on your party clothes,

00:02:58.693 --> 00:03:00.265
you set up the child care,

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:02.308
you put your body in the bed,

00:03:02.332 --> 00:03:04.879
you let your skin
touch your partner's skin

00:03:04.903 --> 00:03:07.280
and allow your body
to wake up and remember,

00:03:07.304 --> 00:03:09.766
"Oh, right! I like this.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.440
I like this person!"

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:13.972
That's responsive desire,

00:03:13.996 --> 00:03:18.593
and it is key to understanding the couples
who sustain a strong sexual connection

00:03:18.617 --> 00:03:19.967
over the long term,

00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:22.644
because -- and this is the part
where I tell my friends

00:03:22.668 --> 00:03:26.791
the two characteristics of the couples who
do sustain a strong sexual connection --

00:03:26.815 --> 00:03:31.474
one, they have a strong friendship
at the foundation of their relationship.

00:03:31.498 --> 00:03:34.160
Specifically, they have strong trust.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.451
Relationship researcher and therapist,

00:03:36.475 --> 00:03:38.458
developer of emotionally focused therapy,

00:03:38.482 --> 00:03:39.641
Sue Johnson,

00:03:39.665 --> 00:03:41.940
boils trust down to this question:

00:03:41.964 --> 00:03:44.839
Are you there for me?

00:03:44.863 --> 00:03:48.587
Especially, are you emotionally
present and available for me?

00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:50.917
Friends are there for each other.

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:52.403
One.

00:03:52.427 --> 00:03:57.623
The second characteristic
is that they prioritize sex.

00:03:57.647 --> 00:04:01.577
They decide that it matters
for their relationship.

00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:06.098
They choose to set aside all the other
things that they could be doing --

00:04:06.122 --> 00:04:09.969
the children they could be raising
and the jobs they could be going to,

00:04:09.993 --> 00:04:12.152
the other family members
to pay attention to,

00:04:12.176 --> 00:04:14.594
the other friends they might
want to hang out with.

00:04:14.618 --> 00:04:17.857
God forbid they just want
to watch some television or go to sleep.

00:04:17.881 --> 00:04:21.412
Stop doing all that stuff
and create a protected space

00:04:21.436 --> 00:04:24.794
where all you're going to do
is put your body in the bed

00:04:24.818 --> 00:04:27.147
and let your skin
touch your partner's skin.

00:04:28.202 --> 00:04:29.356
So that's it:

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.962
best friends,

00:04:30.986 --> 00:04:32.295
prioritize sex.

00:04:33.201 --> 00:04:35.176
So I said this to my friends in the bar.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.594
I was like, best friends, prioritize sex,
I told them about the party,

00:04:38.618 --> 00:04:41.130
I said you put your skin
next to your partner's skin.

00:04:41.154 --> 00:04:46.349
And one of the partners
I was talking to goes, "Aaagh."

00:04:46.373 --> 00:04:47.521
(Laughter)

00:04:47.545 --> 00:04:49.743
And I was like, "OK,
so, there's your problem."

00:04:49.767 --> 00:04:50.813
(Laughter)

00:04:50.837 --> 00:04:54.760
The difficulty was not that they did not
want to go to the party, necessarily.

00:04:54.784 --> 00:04:57.984
If the difficulty is just a lack
of spontaneous desire for party,

00:04:58.008 --> 00:04:59.160
you know what to do:

00:04:59.184 --> 00:05:01.818
you put on your party clothes
and show up for the party.

00:05:01.842 --> 00:05:04.539
If you're having fun at the party,
you're doing it right.

00:05:04.563 --> 00:05:06.628
Their difficulty was that this was a party

00:05:06.652 --> 00:05:10.518
where she didn't love
what there was available to eat,

00:05:10.542 --> 00:05:12.462
the music was not her favorite music,

00:05:12.486 --> 00:05:16.191
and she wasn't totally sure she felt great
about her relationships with people

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:17.555
who were at the party.

00:05:17.579 --> 00:05:19.524
And this happens all the time:

00:05:19.548 --> 00:05:25.049
nice people who love each other
come to dread sex.

00:05:25.073 --> 00:05:27.134
These couples, if they seek sex therapy,

00:05:27.158 --> 00:05:29.360
the therapist might have them stand up

00:05:29.384 --> 00:05:32.594
and put as much distance
between their bodies as they need

00:05:32.618 --> 00:05:34.173
in order to feel comfortable,

00:05:34.197 --> 00:05:39.857
and the less interested partner
will make 20 feet of space.

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:43.719
And the really difficult part
is that space is not empty.

00:05:43.743 --> 00:05:48.382
It is crowded with weeks or months or more

00:05:48.406 --> 00:05:50.226
of the, "You're not listening to me,"

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.720
and "I don't know what's wrong with me
but your criticism isn't helping,"

00:05:53.744 --> 00:05:56.954
and, "If you loved me, you would,"
and, "You're not there for me."

00:05:56.978 --> 00:06:00.747
Years, maybe, of all
these difficult feelings.

00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:03.055
In the book, I use
this really silly metaphor

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:06.026
of difficult feelings as sleepy hedgehogs

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.259
that you are fostering until
you can find a way to set them free

00:06:10.283 --> 00:06:14.055
by turning toward them
with kindness and compassion.

00:06:14.079 --> 00:06:17.630
And the couples who struggle
to maintain a strong sexual connection,

00:06:17.654 --> 00:06:21.667
the distance between them
is crowded with these sleepy hedgehogs.

00:06:21.691 --> 00:06:24.447
And it happens in any relationship
that lasts long enough.

00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:28.112
You, too, are fostering
a prickle of sleepy hedgehogs

00:06:28.136 --> 00:06:30.827
between you and your certain
special someone.

00:06:30.851 --> 00:06:34.138
The difference between couples
who sustain a strong sexual connection

00:06:34.162 --> 00:06:35.316
and the ones who don't

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.091
is not that they don't experience
these difficult hurt feelings,

00:06:39.115 --> 00:06:41.873
it's that they turn towards
those difficult feelings

00:06:41.897 --> 00:06:44.197
with kindness and compassion

00:06:44.221 --> 00:06:46.208
so that they can set them free

00:06:46.232 --> 00:06:48.489
and find their way back to each other.

00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:53.545
So my friends in the bar are faced
with the question under the question,

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:56.374
not, "How do we sustain
a strong connection?"

00:06:56.398 --> 00:06:58.885
but, "How do we find our way back to it?"

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.240
And, yes, there is science
to answer this question,

00:07:02.264 --> 00:07:04.475
but in 25 years as a sex educator,

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:06.805
one thing I have learned
is sometimes, Emily,

00:07:06.829 --> 00:07:08.170
less science,

00:07:09.127 --> 00:07:10.603
more hedgehogs.

00:07:10.627 --> 00:07:12.750
So I told them about me.

00:07:12.774 --> 00:07:18.217
I spent many months writing a book about
the science of women's sexual well-being.

00:07:18.241 --> 00:07:21.269
I was thinking about sex
all day, every day,

00:07:21.293 --> 00:07:25.841
and I was so stressed by the project
that I had zero -- zero! -- interest

00:07:25.865 --> 00:07:27.676
in actually having any sex.

00:07:28.167 --> 00:07:30.777
And then I spent months
traveling all over,

00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:32.602
talking with anyone who would listen

00:07:32.626 --> 00:07:34.920
about the science
of women's sexual well-being.

00:07:34.944 --> 00:07:36.959
And by the time I got home, you know,

00:07:36.983 --> 00:07:39.354
I'd show up for the party,
put my body in the bed,

00:07:39.378 --> 00:07:41.405
let my skin touch my partner's skin,

00:07:41.429 --> 00:07:45.710
and I was so exhausted and overwhelmed
I would just cry and fall asleep.

00:07:46.463 --> 00:07:52.327
And the months of isolation
fostered fear and loneliness

00:07:52.351 --> 00:07:54.066
and frustration.

00:07:54.535 --> 00:07:56.525
So many hedgehogs.

00:07:57.173 --> 00:08:01.373
My best friend, this person
I love and admire,

00:08:01.397 --> 00:08:03.747
felt a million miles away.

00:08:05.081 --> 00:08:06.360
But ...

00:08:07.155 --> 00:08:08.582
he was still there for me.

00:08:08.963 --> 00:08:12.265
No matter how many
difficult feelings there were,

00:08:12.289 --> 00:08:14.947
he turned toward them
with kindness and compassion.

00:08:14.971 --> 00:08:16.491
He never turned away.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:19.503
And what was the second characteristic

00:08:19.527 --> 00:08:21.940
of couples who sustain
a strong sexual connection?

00:08:22.972 --> 00:08:24.304
They prioritize sex.

00:08:24.328 --> 00:08:27.882
They decide that it matters
for their relationship,

00:08:27.906 --> 00:08:31.206
that they do what it takes
to find their way back to the connection.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:34.927
I told my friends what sex therapist
and researcher Peggy Kleinplatz says.

00:08:34.951 --> 00:08:39.096
She asks: What kind of sex
is worth wanting?

00:08:39.993 --> 00:08:43.255
My partner and I looked
at the quality of our connection

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:45.138
and what it brought to our lives,

00:08:45.162 --> 00:08:48.006
and we looked at the family
of sleepy hedgehogs

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:51.436
I had introduced into our home.

00:08:53.016 --> 00:08:54.633
And we decided it was worth it.

00:08:55.268 --> 00:09:00.424
We decided -- we chose -- to do
what it took to find our way,

00:09:00.448 --> 00:09:02.651
turning towards each
of those sleepy hedgehogs,

00:09:02.675 --> 00:09:04.316
those difficult hurt feelings,

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.708
with kindness and compassion

00:09:05.732 --> 00:09:08.480
and setting them free
so that we could find our way back

00:09:08.504 --> 00:09:11.238
to the connection that mattered
for our relationship.

00:09:13.095 --> 00:09:15.065
This is not the story we are usually told

00:09:15.089 --> 00:09:18.223
about how sexual desire works
in long-term relationships.

00:09:19.318 --> 00:09:21.927
But I can think of nothing more romantic,

00:09:23.102 --> 00:09:24.379
nothing sexier,

00:09:24.992 --> 00:09:29.084
than being chosen as a priority

00:09:29.108 --> 00:09:31.850
because that connection matters enough,

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:37.370
even after I introduced all of these
difficult feelings into our relationship.

00:09:38.568 --> 00:09:42.857
How do you sustain a strong
sexual connection over the long term?

00:09:44.254 --> 00:09:47.380
You look into the eyes
of your best friend,

00:09:47.404 --> 00:09:51.024
and you keep choosing
to find your way back.

00:09:51.833 --> 00:09:53.008
Thank you.

00:09:53.032 --> 00:09:55.795
