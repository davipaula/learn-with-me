00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:16.656
When I was a kid,
I was afraid of the dark.

00:00:18.032 --> 00:00:20.632
The darkness is where the monsters are.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.724
And I had this little night light
outside of my bedroom

00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:28.416
so that it would never get too dark.

00:00:29.973 --> 00:00:34.838
But over time, my fear of the dark
turned to curiosity.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.348
What is out there in the "dark-dark?"

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.777
And it turns out

00:00:41.728 --> 00:00:46.427
that trying to understand the darkness
is something that's fascinated humans

00:00:46.451 --> 00:00:48.625
for thousands of years, maybe forever.

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:51.246
And we know this

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.007
because we find their ancient relics
of their attempts to map the sky.

00:00:58.317 --> 00:01:01.626
This tusk is over 30,000 years old.

00:01:02.413 --> 00:01:05.404
Some people think
that it's a carving of Orion

00:01:05.428 --> 00:01:07.515
or maybe a calendar.

00:01:07.944 --> 00:01:09.094
We don't know.

00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:14.156
The Fuxi star map is over 6,000 years old,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.647
and it's from a neolithic tomb
in ancient China.

00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:19.697
And that little pile of clamshells

00:01:19.721 --> 00:01:22.544
underneath the dead guy's
foot in the middle --

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:25.434
that's supposed to be the Big Dipper.

00:01:25.458 --> 00:01:26.608
Maybe.

00:01:27.284 --> 00:01:29.997
The Nebra disk is uncontroversial.

00:01:30.902 --> 00:01:34.847
You don't have to be an astronomer to know
that you're looking at the Moon phases

00:01:34.871 --> 00:01:36.307
or the Sun in eclipse.

00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:40.386
And that little group of seven stars,
that's the Pleiades, the Seven Sisters.

00:01:41.553 --> 00:01:43.409
But in any case, the point is clear:

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.837
astronomers have been
mapping the sky for a long time.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.640
Why?

00:01:50.227 --> 00:01:55.625
It's our calling card
as a species in the galaxy

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.608
to figure things out.

00:01:58.203 --> 00:02:00.339
We know our planet,

00:02:00.363 --> 00:02:01.964
we cure our diseases,

00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:03.728
we cook our food,

00:02:03.752 --> 00:02:05.577
we leave our planet.

00:02:08.426 --> 00:02:09.626
But it's not easy.

00:02:11.037 --> 00:02:13.902
Understanding the universe is battle.

00:02:14.728 --> 00:02:18.101
It is unrelenting, it is time-varying,

00:02:18.125 --> 00:02:20.592
and it is one we are all in together.

00:02:21.292 --> 00:02:25.656
It is a battle in the darkness
against the darkness.

00:02:26.853 --> 00:02:30.472
Which is why Orion has weapons.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.323
In any case, if you're
going to engage in this battle,

00:02:37.347 --> 00:02:39.260
you need to know the battlefield.

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:40.482
So at its core,

00:02:40.506 --> 00:02:43.172
mapping the sky involves
three essential elements.

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:46.383
You've got objects
that are giving off light,

00:02:46.407 --> 00:02:49.748
you've got telescopes
that are collecting that light,

00:02:49.772 --> 00:02:51.208
and you've got instruments

00:02:51.232 --> 00:02:54.172
that are helping you understand
what that light is.

00:02:54.196 --> 00:02:57.565
Many of you have mapped
the Moon phases over time

00:02:57.589 --> 00:03:02.109
with your eyes, your eyes being
your more basic telescope.

00:03:02.133 --> 00:03:04.712
And you've understood
what that means with your brains,

00:03:04.736 --> 00:03:07.482
your brains being one
of your more basic instruments.

00:03:07.506 --> 00:03:09.453
Now, if you and a buddy get together,

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:14.948
you would spend over 30 years,

00:03:14.972 --> 00:03:18.511
you would map 1,000 stars
extremely precisely.

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:21.202
You would move
the front line to the battle.

00:03:21.552 --> 00:03:25.514
And that's what Tycho Brahe
and his buddy, or his assistant, really,

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:28.307
Johannes Kepler did back in the 1600s.

00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:30.601
And they moved the line,

00:03:30.625 --> 00:03:32.451
figured out how planets worked,

00:03:32.475 --> 00:03:34.229
how they moved around the Sun.

00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:37.784
But it wasn't until about 100 years ago

00:03:37.808 --> 00:03:40.079
that we realized

00:03:40.103 --> 00:03:41.471
it's a big universe.

00:03:42.214 --> 00:03:46.445
It seems like the universe
is just infinite, which it is,

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:49.356
but the observable universe is finite.

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.155
Which means we can win the battle.

00:03:54.402 --> 00:03:56.408
But if you're going to map the universe,

00:03:57.283 --> 00:04:00.054
you're not going to do it
with one or two of your besties.

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.187
Mapping the universe takes an army,

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.434
an army of curious, creative, craftspeople

00:04:07.458 --> 00:04:10.863
who, working together,
can accomplish the extraordinary.

00:04:12.476 --> 00:04:14.302
I lead this army of creatives,

00:04:14.326 --> 00:04:18.225
in the fifth generation
of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, SDSS.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.125
And this is how astronomers have managed
to shepherd individual curiosity

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:25.260
through its industrial age,

00:04:25.284 --> 00:04:28.641
preserving the individual ability
to make discoveries

00:04:28.665 --> 00:04:32.551
but putting into place mega machinery
to truly advance the frontier.

00:04:33.822 --> 00:04:36.885
In SDSS, we divide the sky
into three mappers:

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:40.440
one for the stars, one for the black holes

00:04:40.464 --> 00:04:42.339
and one for the galaxies.

00:04:42.363 --> 00:04:44.641
My survey has two hemispheres,

00:04:44.665 --> 00:04:48.966
five telescopes, or 11,
depending on how you count,

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.549
10 spectrographs

00:04:50.573 --> 00:04:52.323
and millions of objects.

00:04:52.347 --> 00:04:53.732
It's a monster.

00:04:53.756 --> 00:04:55.321
So let's go through the mappers.

00:04:57.351 --> 00:05:03.803
The Milky Way galaxy has 250 billion
plus or minus a few hundred billion stars.

00:05:05.497 --> 00:05:07.934
That is not a number
that you hold in your head.

00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.299
That is a number that doesn't
make practical sense

00:05:10.323 --> 00:05:11.608
to pretty much anybody.

00:05:11.632 --> 00:05:15.032
You never get 250 billion jelly beans
in your hand. You know?

00:05:17.543 --> 00:05:20.765
We're nowhere near mapping
all of those stars yet.

00:05:21.345 --> 00:05:23.767
So we have to choose
the most interesting ones.

00:05:24.829 --> 00:05:28.979
In SDSS-V, we're mapping six million stars

00:05:29.003 --> 00:05:31.089
where we think we can measure their age.

00:05:31.662 --> 00:05:33.836
Because if you can measure
the age of a star,

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.641
that's like having six million clocks
spread all throughout the Milky Way.

00:05:37.665 --> 00:05:39.103
And with that information,

00:05:39.127 --> 00:05:43.747
we can unravel the history
and fossil record of our galaxy

00:05:43.771 --> 00:05:45.137
and learn how it formed.

00:05:47.238 --> 00:05:49.578
I'm just going to cut
right to the chase here.

00:05:50.436 --> 00:05:55.289
Black holes are among the most perplexing
objects in the universe.

00:05:55.627 --> 00:05:56.783
Why?

00:05:56.807 --> 00:06:00.818
Because they are literally just
math incarnate, in a physical form,

00:06:00.842 --> 00:06:02.340
that we barely understand.

00:06:03.085 --> 00:06:07.727
It's like the number zero being animated
and walking around the corridors here.

00:06:07.751 --> 00:06:09.157
That would be super weird.

00:06:09.181 --> 00:06:10.552
These are weirder.

00:06:10.576 --> 00:06:12.680
And it's not just like a basketball

00:06:12.704 --> 00:06:16.434
that you smoosh down into a little point
and it's super dense and that's weird.

00:06:16.458 --> 00:06:19.125
No, smooshed basketballs have a surface.

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:22.529
These things don't have surfaces,
and we know that now.

00:06:23.228 --> 00:06:24.902
Because we've seen it.

00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:26.298
Or the lack of it.

00:06:27.609 --> 00:06:29.617
What's really interesting
about black holes

00:06:29.641 --> 00:06:33.247
is that we can learn a lot about them
by studying the material

00:06:33.271 --> 00:06:38.074
just as it passes through that point
of no information return.

00:06:38.098 --> 00:06:39.550
Because at that point,

00:06:39.574 --> 00:06:45.352
it's emitting lots of X-rays
and optical and UV and radio waves.

00:06:45.376 --> 00:06:48.387
We can actually learn
how these objects grow.

00:06:48.956 --> 00:06:54.498
And in SDSS, we're looking at over
half a million supermassive black holes,

00:06:54.522 --> 00:06:56.988
to try to understand how they formed.

00:06:58.022 --> 00:06:59.267
Like I said,

00:07:00.109 --> 00:07:03.087
we live in the Milky Way,
you guys are all familiar with that.

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:07.660
The Milky Way is a completely
average galaxy.

00:07:08.605 --> 00:07:10.138
Nothing funny going on.

00:07:10.859 --> 00:07:12.792
But it's ours, which is great.

00:07:14.794 --> 00:07:18.834
We think that the Milky Way,
and all the Milky Ways,

00:07:18.858 --> 00:07:21.498
have this really disturbing past

00:07:21.522 --> 00:07:24.773
of literally blowing themselves apart.

00:07:25.597 --> 00:07:29.177
It's like every average guy you know

00:07:29.201 --> 00:07:31.922
has a history as a punk rock teenager.

00:07:32.582 --> 00:07:33.915
That's very bizarre.

00:07:36.744 --> 00:07:38.775
Stars are blowing up in these systems,

00:07:38.799 --> 00:07:40.783
black holes are growing at their centers

00:07:40.807 --> 00:07:43.363
and emitting a tremendous
amount of energy.

00:07:43.387 --> 00:07:46.331
How does that happen,
how does this transformation happen?

00:07:46.355 --> 00:07:48.839
And at SDSS, we're going
to the bellies of the beast

00:07:48.863 --> 00:07:50.597
and zooming way in,

00:07:50.621 --> 00:07:53.613
to look at these processes
where they are occurring

00:07:53.637 --> 00:07:58.663
in order to understand how Sid Vicious
grows up into Ward Cleaver.

00:08:01.389 --> 00:08:02.801
My arsenal.

00:08:02.825 --> 00:08:04.849
These are my two big telescopes.

00:08:04.873 --> 00:08:09.764
The Apache Point Observatory
hosts the Sloan telescope in New Mexico,

00:08:09.788 --> 00:08:11.942
and the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile

00:08:11.966 --> 00:08:14.950
hosts the two-and-a-half-meter
telescope, the du Pont.

00:08:15.734 --> 00:08:18.337
Two and a half meters
is the size of our mirror,

00:08:18.361 --> 00:08:20.388
which was huge for Tycho and Kepler.

00:08:20.412 --> 00:08:22.226
But it's actually not so big today.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:24.647
There are way bigger telescopes out there.

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:29.803
But in SDSS we use new instruments
on these old telescopes

00:08:29.827 --> 00:08:31.494
to make them interesting.

00:08:32.422 --> 00:08:37.085
We capture light from all
of those objects into our aperture,

00:08:37.109 --> 00:08:40.037
and that light is then focused
at the focal plane,

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:42.403
where our instruments sit
and process that light.

00:08:42.831 --> 00:08:44.765
What's new in SDSS-V

00:08:44.789 --> 00:08:48.510
is that we're making the focal plane
entirely robotic.

00:08:49.051 --> 00:08:51.159
That's right: robots.

00:08:51.183 --> 00:08:52.333
(Laughter)

00:08:53.019 --> 00:08:55.125
So I'm going to show them to you,

00:08:55.149 --> 00:08:58.782
but they're fierce and terrifying,

00:08:58.806 --> 00:09:00.826
and I want you all to just take a breath.

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:03.204
(Exhales) Trigger warning.

00:09:03.722 --> 00:09:07.562
And with no apologies to all
the Blade Runners among you,

00:09:08.516 --> 00:09:09.873
here they are.

00:09:09.897 --> 00:09:11.610
(Laughter)

00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:13.029
I have 1,000 of these,

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:16.350
500 in the focal plane
of each telescope in each hemisphere.

00:09:18.061 --> 00:09:19.939
And this is how they move on the sky.

00:09:20.411 --> 00:09:22.698
So these are our objects and a star field,

00:09:22.722 --> 00:09:24.897
so you've got stars,
galaxies, black holes.

00:09:24.921 --> 00:09:29.873
And our robots move to those objects
as we pass over them

00:09:29.897 --> 00:09:31.482
in order to capture the light

00:09:31.506 --> 00:09:35.387
from those stars and galaxies
and black holes, and yes,

00:09:35.411 --> 00:09:37.625
it is weird to capture black hole light,

00:09:37.649 --> 00:09:40.608
but we've already gone over
that black holes are weird.

00:09:42.475 --> 00:09:43.625
One more thing.

00:09:44.966 --> 00:09:47.427
Stars are exploding all the time,

00:09:47.451 --> 00:09:51.169
like this one did back in 1987
in our cosmic backyard.

00:09:53.427 --> 00:09:56.792
Black holes are growing all the time.

00:09:59.088 --> 00:10:02.596
There is a new sky every night.

00:10:03.438 --> 00:10:06.771
Which means we can't just
map the sky one time.

00:10:06.795 --> 00:10:09.329
We have to map the sky multiple times.

00:10:10.782 --> 00:10:15.011
So in SDSS-V, we're going back
to each part of the sky multiple times

00:10:15.035 --> 00:10:18.392
in order to see how
these objects change over time.

00:10:18.416 --> 00:10:21.700
Because those changes in time
encode the physics,

00:10:21.724 --> 00:10:25.703
and they encode how these objects
are growing and changing.

00:10:27.399 --> 00:10:28.549
Mow the sky.

00:10:30.177 --> 00:10:32.168
OK, let me just recap.

00:10:32.744 --> 00:10:35.323
Global survey, two hemispheres,

00:10:36.537 --> 00:10:41.593
five telescopes, 10 spectrographs,
millions of objects, mow the sky,

00:10:41.617 --> 00:10:44.537
creative army, robots, yeah.

00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:46.229
So you're thinking, "Wow.

00:10:46.253 --> 00:10:48.958
She must have this
industrial machine going,

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:52.252
no room for the individual, curious,
lone wolf genius," right?

00:10:52.847 --> 00:10:54.559
And you'd be 100 percent wrong.

00:10:55.234 --> 00:10:56.701
Meet Hanny's Voorwerp.

00:10:57.274 --> 00:10:59.504
Hanny van Arkel was a Dutch schoolteacher

00:10:59.528 --> 00:11:03.424
who was analyzing the public
versions of the SDSS data,

00:11:03.448 --> 00:11:07.248
when she found this
incredibly rare type of object,

00:11:07.272 --> 00:11:09.805
which is now a subject of major study.

00:11:10.621 --> 00:11:12.171
She was able to do this

00:11:12.195 --> 00:11:16.720
because SDSS, since its beginning
and by mandate from the Sloan Foundation,

00:11:16.744 --> 00:11:19.379
has made its data both publicly available

00:11:19.403 --> 00:11:23.196
and usable to a broad range of audiences.

00:11:23.792 --> 00:11:26.537
She's a citizen -- yeah, clap for that.

00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:27.712
Clap for that.

00:11:27.736 --> 00:11:30.982
(Applause)

00:11:31.006 --> 00:11:32.538
Hanny is a citizen scientist,

00:11:32.562 --> 00:11:34.346
or as I like to call them,

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:35.653
"citizen warriors."

00:11:36.284 --> 00:11:42.585
And she shows that you don't have to be
a fancy astrophysicist to participate.

00:11:43.037 --> 00:11:44.712
You just have to be curious.

00:11:46.425 --> 00:11:47.999
A few years ago,

00:11:48.023 --> 00:11:51.355
my four-year-old asked,
"Can moons have moons?"

00:11:51.989 --> 00:11:53.958
And I set about to answer this question

00:11:53.982 --> 00:11:57.569
because even though many
four-year-olds over all of time

00:11:57.593 --> 00:11:59.606
have probably asked this question,

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:03.395
many experts, including myself,
didn't know the answer.

00:12:04.157 --> 00:12:08.005
These are the moons in our solar system
that can host hypothetical submoons.

00:12:08.491 --> 00:12:12.506
And that just goes to show you
that there are so many basic questions

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.664
left to be understood.

00:12:17.665 --> 00:12:22.337
And this brings me to the most
important point about SDSS.

00:12:23.036 --> 00:12:27.116
Because, yeah, the stars, the galaxies,
the black holes, the robots --

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.606
that's all super cool.

00:12:30.879 --> 00:12:32.942
But the coolest thing of all

00:12:32.966 --> 00:12:36.210
is that eensy-weensy creatures
on a rubble pile

00:12:36.234 --> 00:12:40.063
around a totally average star
in a totally average galaxy

00:12:40.087 --> 00:12:43.872
can win the battle
to understand their world.

00:12:44.714 --> 00:12:49.585
Every dot in this video is a galaxy.

00:12:51.323 --> 00:12:52.473
Every dot.

00:12:59.553 --> 00:13:06.315
(Cheers) (Applause)

00:13:06.339 --> 00:13:08.229
I'm showing here the number of galaxies

00:13:08.253 --> 00:13:11.648
that astronomers have mapped
in large surveys since about 1980.

00:13:12.109 --> 00:13:14.863
You can see SDSS kick in around Y2K.

00:13:15.921 --> 00:13:18.501
If we stay on this line,

00:13:18.525 --> 00:13:24.430
we will map every large galaxy
in the observable universe by 2060.

00:13:25.406 --> 00:13:26.760
Think about that.

00:13:26.784 --> 00:13:30.910
Think about it: we've gone
from arranging clamshells

00:13:30.934 --> 00:13:35.021
to general relativity to SDSS
in a few thousand years --

00:13:35.045 --> 00:13:37.355
and if we hang on 40 more,

00:13:39.077 --> 00:13:41.140
we can map all the galaxies.

00:13:41.859 --> 00:13:43.709
But we have to stay on the line.

00:13:44.557 --> 00:13:45.898
Will that be our choice?

00:13:48.684 --> 00:13:51.323
There are dark forces in this world

00:13:51.347 --> 00:13:57.704
that will rob our entire species
of our right to understand our universe.

00:13:58.466 --> 00:13:59.991
Don't be afraid of the dark.

00:14:00.498 --> 00:14:01.648
Fight back.

00:14:02.173 --> 00:14:03.363
Join us.

00:14:03.387 --> 00:14:04.537
Thank you.

00:14:04.561 --> 00:14:11.412
(Applause)
