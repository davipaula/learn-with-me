00:00:12.968 --> 00:00:14.118
Hello, everyone.

00:00:15.562 --> 00:00:20.498
It's a bit funny, because I did write
that humans will become digital,

00:00:20.522 --> 00:00:23.236
but I didn't think it will happen so fast

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.919
and that it will happen to me.

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.331
But here I am, as a digital avatar,

00:00:28.355 --> 00:00:31.021
and here you are, so let's start.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.203
And let's start with a question.

00:00:34.823 --> 00:00:38.357
How many fascists are there
in the audience today?

00:00:38.381 --> 00:00:39.831
(Laughter)

00:00:39.855 --> 00:00:42.204
Well, it's a bit difficult to say,

00:00:42.228 --> 00:00:45.695
because we've forgotten what fascism is.

00:00:46.498 --> 00:00:49.077
People now use the term "fascist"

00:00:49.101 --> 00:00:52.109
as a kind of general-purpose abuse.

00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:56.080
Or they confuse fascism with nationalism.

00:00:56.863 --> 00:01:02.251
So let's take a few minutes
to clarify what fascism actually is,

00:01:02.275 --> 00:01:05.395
and how it is different from nationalism.

00:01:05.838 --> 00:01:10.879
The milder forms of nationalism
have been among the most benevolent

00:01:10.903 --> 00:01:12.361
of human creations.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.101
Nations are communities
of millions of strangers

00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:18.838
who don't really know each other.

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:22.894
For example, I don't know
the eight million people

00:01:22.918 --> 00:01:25.474
who share my Israeli citizenship.

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:28.276
But thanks to nationalism,

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.106
we can all care about one another
and cooperate effectively.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.650
This is very good.

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:39.831
Some people, like John Lennon,
imagine that without nationalism,

00:01:39.855 --> 00:01:43.645
the world will be a peaceful paradise.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.438
But far more likely,

00:01:45.462 --> 00:01:50.239
without nationalism,
we would have been living in tribal chaos.

00:01:50.684 --> 00:01:55.819
If you look today at the most prosperous
and peaceful countries in the world,

00:01:55.843 --> 00:02:00.133
countries like Sweden
and Switzerland and Japan,

00:02:00.157 --> 00:02:05.120
you will see that they have
a very strong sense of nationalism.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.910
In contrast, countries that lack
a strong sense of nationalism,

00:02:09.934 --> 00:02:13.355
like Congo and Somalia and Afghanistan,

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.553
tend to be violent and poor.

00:02:16.855 --> 00:02:20.993
So what is fascism, and how
is it different from nationalism?

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:27.344
Well, nationalism tells me
that my nation is unique,

00:02:27.368 --> 00:02:31.169
and that I have special obligations
towards my nation.

00:02:31.641 --> 00:02:37.847
Fascism, in contrast, tells me
that my nation is supreme,

00:02:37.871 --> 00:02:41.783
and that I have exclusive
obligations towards it.

00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:47.726
I don't need to care about anybody
or anything other than my nation.

00:02:48.465 --> 00:02:52.068
Usually, of course,
people have many identities

00:02:52.092 --> 00:02:54.514
and loyalties to different groups.

00:02:55.036 --> 00:02:59.840
For example, I can be a good patriot,
loyal to my country,

00:02:59.864 --> 00:03:03.102
and at the same time,
be loyal to my family,

00:03:03.126 --> 00:03:05.487
my neighborhood, my profession,

00:03:05.511 --> 00:03:06.971
humankind as a whole,

00:03:06.995 --> 00:03:08.599
truth and beauty.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.641
Of course, when I have different
identities and loyalties,

00:03:13.665 --> 00:03:16.998
it sometimes creates conflicts
and complications.

00:03:17.506 --> 00:03:21.140
But, well, who ever told you
that life was easy?

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:23.689
Life is complicated.

00:03:23.713 --> 00:03:24.863
Deal with it.

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:32.331
Fascism is what happens when people try
to ignore the complications

00:03:32.355 --> 00:03:35.464
and to make life too easy for themselves.

00:03:36.128 --> 00:03:41.700
Fascism denies all identities
except the national identity

00:03:41.724 --> 00:03:46.833
and insists that I have obligations
only towards my nation.

00:03:47.421 --> 00:03:51.525
If my nation demands
that I sacrifice my family,

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.985
then I will sacrifice my family.

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:58.283
If the nation demands
that I kill millions of people,

00:03:58.307 --> 00:04:00.965
then I will kill millions of people.

00:04:01.442 --> 00:04:07.517
And if my nation demands
that I betray truth and beauty,

00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:10.564
then I should betray truth and beauty.

00:04:11.587 --> 00:04:16.113
For example, how does
a fascist evaluate art?

00:04:16.615 --> 00:04:21.904
How does a fascist decide whether a movie
is a good movie or a bad movie?

00:04:22.728 --> 00:04:26.900
Well, it's very, very, very simple.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.188
There is really just one yardstick:

00:04:29.593 --> 00:04:33.069
if the movie serves
the interests of the nation,

00:04:33.093 --> 00:04:34.537
it's a good movie;

00:04:34.561 --> 00:04:37.744
if the movie doesn't serve
the interests of the nation,

00:04:37.768 --> 00:04:38.990
it's a bad movie.

00:04:39.014 --> 00:04:40.164
That's it.

00:04:40.496 --> 00:04:45.384
Similarly, how does a fascist decide
what to teach kids in school?

00:04:45.877 --> 00:04:47.964
Again, it's very simple.

00:04:47.988 --> 00:04:49.933
There is just one yardstick:

00:04:49.957 --> 00:04:54.902
you teach the kids whatever serves
the interests of the nation.

00:04:55.323 --> 00:04:57.910
The truth doesn't matter at all.

00:05:00.372 --> 00:05:05.798
Now, the horrors of the Second World War
and of the Holocaust remind us

00:05:05.822 --> 00:05:09.955
of the terrible consequences
of this way of thinking.

00:05:10.508 --> 00:05:15.053
But usually, when we talk
about the ills of fascism,

00:05:15.077 --> 00:05:18.037
we do so in an ineffective way,

00:05:18.061 --> 00:05:22.799
because we tend to depict fascism
as a hideous monster,

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:26.729
without really explaining
what was so seductive about it.

00:05:27.284 --> 00:05:31.998
It's a bit like these Hollywood movies
that depict the bad guys --

00:05:32.022 --> 00:05:36.045
Voldemort or Sauron
or Darth Vader --

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:38.701
as ugly and mean and cruel.

00:05:38.725 --> 00:05:41.263
They're cruel even
to their own supporters.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.291
When I see these movies,
I never understand --

00:05:45.315 --> 00:05:51.820
why would anybody be tempted to follow
a disgusting creep like Voldemort?

00:05:52.895 --> 00:05:56.411
The problem with evil
is that in real life,

00:05:56.435 --> 00:05:59.326
evil doesn't necessarily look ugly.

00:05:59.688 --> 00:06:01.580
It can look very beautiful.

00:06:02.354 --> 00:06:05.077
This is something that
Christianity knew very well,

00:06:05.101 --> 00:06:08.807
which is why in Christian art,
as [opposed to] Hollywood,

00:06:08.831 --> 00:06:12.699
Satan is usually depicted
as a gorgeous hunk.

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:17.855
This is why it's so difficult
to resist the temptations of Satan,

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:22.623
and why it is also difficult
to resist the temptations of fascism.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.702
Fascism makes people see themselves

00:06:25.726 --> 00:06:30.969
as belonging to the most beautiful
and most important thing in the world --

00:06:30.993 --> 00:06:32.295
the nation.

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:33.665
And then people think,

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:36.878
"Well, they taught us
that fascism is ugly.

00:06:37.442 --> 00:06:40.466
But when I look in the mirror,
I see something very beautiful,

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.681
so I can't be a fascist, right?"

00:06:43.022 --> 00:06:44.173
Wrong.

00:06:44.197 --> 00:06:45.744
That's the problem with fascism.

00:06:45.768 --> 00:06:48.387
When you look in the fascist mirror,

00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:52.945
you see yourself as far more beautiful
than you really are.

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:57.664
In the 1930s, when Germans
looked in the fascist mirror,

00:06:57.688 --> 00:07:01.728
they saw Germany as the most
beautiful thing in the world.

00:07:02.244 --> 00:07:05.680
If today, Russians look
in the fascist mirror,

00:07:05.704 --> 00:07:09.263
they will see Russia as the most
beautiful thing in the world.

00:07:09.577 --> 00:07:12.705
And if Israelis look
in the fascist mirror,

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:17.109
they will see Israel as the most
beautiful thing in the world.

00:07:18.657 --> 00:07:23.714
This does not mean that we are now
facing a rerun of the 1930s.

00:07:24.304 --> 00:07:27.779
Fascism and dictatorships might come back,

00:07:27.803 --> 00:07:31.042
but they will come back in a new form,

00:07:31.066 --> 00:07:33.807
a form which is much more relevant

00:07:33.831 --> 00:07:37.640
to the new technological realities
of the 21st century.

00:07:38.538 --> 00:07:40.085
In ancient times,

00:07:40.109 --> 00:07:44.269
land was the most important
asset in the world.

00:07:44.911 --> 00:07:48.775
Politics, therefore,
was the struggle to control land.

00:07:49.141 --> 00:07:55.001
And dictatorship meant that all the land
was owned by a single ruler

00:07:55.025 --> 00:07:56.897
or by a small oligarch.

00:07:57.827 --> 00:08:02.646
And in the modern age,
machines became more important than land.

00:08:03.347 --> 00:08:06.947
Politics became the struggle
to control the machines.

00:08:07.354 --> 00:08:09.350
And dictatorship meant

00:08:09.374 --> 00:08:13.284
that too many of the machines
became concentrated

00:08:13.308 --> 00:08:16.588
in the hands of the government
or of a small elite.

00:08:17.109 --> 00:08:21.815
Now data is replacing
both land and machines

00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:23.950
as the most important asset.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:29.940
Politics becomes the struggle
to control the flows of data.

00:08:29.964 --> 00:08:32.672
And dictatorship now means

00:08:32.696 --> 00:08:38.476
that too much data is being concentrated
in the hands of the government

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.420
or of a small elite.

00:08:40.871 --> 00:08:45.783
The greatest danger
that now faces liberal democracy

00:08:45.807 --> 00:08:49.077
is that the revolution
in information technology

00:08:49.101 --> 00:08:53.891
will make dictatorships
more efficient than democracies.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.379
In the 20th century,

00:08:56.403 --> 00:09:01.363
democracy and capitalism
defeated fascism and communism

00:09:01.387 --> 00:09:06.589
because democracy was better
at processing data and making decisions.

00:09:07.319 --> 00:09:09.685
Given 20th-century technology,

00:09:09.709 --> 00:09:15.744
it was simply inefficient to try
and concentrate too much data

00:09:15.768 --> 00:09:18.527
and too much power in one place.

00:09:19.244 --> 00:09:23.727
But it is not a law of nature

00:09:23.751 --> 00:09:29.355
that centralized data processing
is always less efficient

00:09:29.379 --> 00:09:31.926
than distributed data processing.

00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:36.042
With the rise of artificial intelligence
and machine learning,

00:09:36.066 --> 00:09:41.903
it might become feasible to process
enormous amounts of information

00:09:41.927 --> 00:09:44.537
very efficiently in one place,

00:09:44.561 --> 00:09:47.752
to take all the decisions in one place,

00:09:47.776 --> 00:09:52.196
and then centralized data processing
will be more efficient

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.420
than distributed data processing.

00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:58.813
And then the main handicap
of authoritarian regimes

00:09:58.837 --> 00:10:00.474
in the 20th century --

00:10:00.498 --> 00:10:05.014
their attempt to concentrate
all the information in one place --

00:10:05.038 --> 00:10:08.404
it will become their greatest advantage.

00:10:10.768 --> 00:10:15.675
Another technological danger
that threatens the future of democracy

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:20.858
is the merger of information technology
with biotechnology,

00:10:20.882 --> 00:10:24.887
which might result
in the creation of algorithms

00:10:24.911 --> 00:10:29.227
that know me better than I know myself.

00:10:29.688 --> 00:10:31.768
And once you have such algorithms,

00:10:31.792 --> 00:10:34.641
an external system, like the government,

00:10:34.665 --> 00:10:38.189
cannot just predict my decisions,

00:10:38.213 --> 00:10:42.134
it can also manipulate
my feelings, my emotions.

00:10:42.641 --> 00:10:47.886
A dictator may not be able
to provide me with good health care,

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.283
but he will be able to make me love him

00:10:51.307 --> 00:10:53.974
and to make me hate the opposition.

00:10:55.037 --> 00:11:00.500
Democracy will find it difficult
to survive such a development

00:11:00.524 --> 00:11:02.674
because, in the end,

00:11:02.698 --> 00:11:06.825
democracy is not based
on human rationality;

00:11:06.849 --> 00:11:09.269
it's based on human feelings.

00:11:10.355 --> 00:11:12.855
During elections and referendums,

00:11:12.879 --> 00:11:15.575
you're not being asked,
"What do you think?"

00:11:15.998 --> 00:11:19.394
You're actually being asked,
"How do you feel?"

00:11:20.228 --> 00:11:24.855
And if somebody can manipulate
your emotions effectively,

00:11:24.879 --> 00:11:28.632
democracy will become
an emotional puppet show.

00:11:30.006 --> 00:11:34.521
So what can we do to prevent
the return of fascism

00:11:34.545 --> 00:11:37.195
and the rise of new dictatorships?

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:44.300
The number one question that we face
is: Who controls the data?

00:11:44.823 --> 00:11:46.498
If you are an engineer,

00:11:46.522 --> 00:11:50.490
then find ways to prevent too much data

00:11:50.514 --> 00:11:53.339
from being concentrated in too few hands.

00:11:53.752 --> 00:11:56.696
And find ways to make sure

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:01.133
the distributed data processing
is at least as efficient

00:12:01.157 --> 00:12:03.553
as centralized data processing.

00:12:04.077 --> 00:12:07.918
This will be the best
safeguard for democracy.

00:12:07.942 --> 00:12:11.268
As for the rest of us
who are not engineers,

00:12:11.292 --> 00:12:14.736
the number one question facing us

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:19.407
is how not to allow
ourselves to be manipulated

00:12:19.431 --> 00:12:22.237
by those who control the data.

00:12:23.387 --> 00:12:27.493
The enemies of liberal democracy,
they have a method.

00:12:27.919 --> 00:12:30.291
They hack our feelings.

00:12:30.315 --> 00:12:32.767
Not our emails, not our bank accounts --

00:12:32.791 --> 00:12:37.998
they hack our feelings of fear
and hate and vanity,

00:12:38.022 --> 00:12:40.450
and then use these feelings

00:12:40.474 --> 00:12:44.426
to polarize and destroy
democracy from within.

00:12:44.903 --> 00:12:46.823
This is actually a method

00:12:46.847 --> 00:12:51.896
that Silicon Valley pioneered
in order to sell us products.

00:12:52.381 --> 00:12:57.403
But now, the enemies of democracy
are using this very method

00:12:57.427 --> 00:13:01.151
to sell us fear and hate and vanity.

00:13:01.863 --> 00:13:05.522
They cannot create
these feelings out of nothing.

00:13:06.212 --> 00:13:10.043
So they get to know our own
preexisting weaknesses.

00:13:10.403 --> 00:13:12.974
And then use them against us.

00:13:13.482 --> 00:13:16.990
And it is therefore
the responsibility of all of us

00:13:17.014 --> 00:13:19.648
to get to know our weaknesses

00:13:19.672 --> 00:13:23.307
and make sure that they
do not become a weapon

00:13:23.331 --> 00:13:26.214
in the hands of the enemies of democracy.

00:13:27.315 --> 00:13:29.863
Getting to know our own weaknesses

00:13:29.887 --> 00:13:35.470
will also help us to avoid the trap
of the fascist mirror.

00:13:36.204 --> 00:13:40.355
As we explained earlier,
fascism exploits our vanity.

00:13:40.805 --> 00:13:46.551
It makes us see ourselves
as far more beautiful than we really are.

00:13:46.575 --> 00:13:48.042
This is the seduction.

00:13:48.424 --> 00:13:50.871
But if you really know yourself,

00:13:50.895 --> 00:13:54.363
you will not fall
for this kind of flattery.

00:13:54.879 --> 00:13:58.942
If somebody puts a mirror
in front of your eyes

00:13:58.966 --> 00:14:04.026
that hides all your ugly bits
and makes you see yourself

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:08.334
as far more beautiful
and far more important

00:14:08.358 --> 00:14:09.949
than you really are,

00:14:09.973 --> 00:14:12.837
just break that mirror.

00:14:13.696 --> 00:14:14.847
Thank you.

00:14:14.871 --> 00:14:21.253
(Applause)

00:14:22.677 --> 00:14:24.309
Chris Anderson: Yuval, thank you.

00:14:24.333 --> 00:14:25.484
Goodness me.

00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.898
It's so nice to see you again.

00:14:27.922 --> 00:14:29.513
So, if I understand you right,

00:14:29.537 --> 00:14:32.204
you're alerting us
to two big dangers here.

00:14:32.228 --> 00:14:36.720
One is the possible resurgence
of a seductive form of fascism,

00:14:36.744 --> 00:14:40.998
but close to that, dictatorships
that may not exactly be fascistic,

00:14:41.022 --> 00:14:43.585
but control all the data.

00:14:43.609 --> 00:14:45.705
I wonder if there's a third concern

00:14:45.729 --> 00:14:47.847
that some people here
have already expressed,

00:14:47.871 --> 00:14:52.768
which is where, not governments,
but big corporations control all our data.

00:14:52.792 --> 00:14:54.101
What do you call that,

00:14:54.125 --> 00:14:56.512
and how worried should we be about that?

00:14:56.536 --> 00:14:59.875
Yuval Noah Harari: Well, in the end,
there isn't such a big difference

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:02.325
between the corporations
and the governments,

00:15:02.349 --> 00:15:05.769
because, as I said, the questions is:
Who controls the data?

00:15:05.793 --> 00:15:07.188
This is the real government.

00:15:07.212 --> 00:15:09.656
If you call it a corporation
or a government --

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.835
if it's a corporation
and it really controls the data,

00:15:12.859 --> 00:15:14.787
this is our real government.

00:15:14.811 --> 00:15:17.878
So the difference
is more apparent than real.

00:15:18.529 --> 00:15:21.387
CA: But somehow,
at least with corporations,

00:15:21.411 --> 00:15:24.930
you can imagine market mechanisms
where they can be taken down.

00:15:24.954 --> 00:15:26.871
I mean, if consumers just decide

00:15:26.895 --> 00:15:29.649
that the company is no longer
operating in their interest,

00:15:29.673 --> 00:15:31.586
it does open the door to another market.

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:33.156
It seems easier to imagine that

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:36.331
than, say, citizens rising up
and taking down a government

00:15:36.355 --> 00:15:37.967
that is in control of everything.

00:15:37.991 --> 00:15:39.546
YNH: Well, we are not there yet,

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:44.728
but again, if a corporation really
knows you better than you know yourself --

00:15:44.752 --> 00:15:50.006
at least that it can manipulate
your own deepest emotions and desires,

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:51.696
and you won't even realize --

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.299
you will think this is
your authentic self.

00:15:54.768 --> 00:15:58.823
So in theory, yes, in theory,
you can rise against a corporation,

00:15:58.847 --> 00:16:02.580
just as, in theory, you can rise
against a dictatorship.

00:16:02.982 --> 00:16:06.265
But in practice,
it is extremely difficult.

00:16:07.281 --> 00:16:11.363
CA: So in "Homo Deus," you argue
that this would be the century

00:16:11.387 --> 00:16:14.798
when humans kind of became gods,

00:16:14.822 --> 00:16:17.815
either through development
of artificial intelligence

00:16:17.839 --> 00:16:20.768
or through genetic engineering.

00:16:20.792 --> 00:16:26.260
Has this prospect of political
system shift, collapse

00:16:26.284 --> 00:16:28.948
impacted your view on that possibility?

00:16:29.553 --> 00:16:32.648
YNH: Well, I think it makes it
even more likely,

00:16:32.672 --> 00:16:35.601
and more likely
that it will happen faster,

00:16:35.625 --> 00:16:40.648
because in times of crisis,
people are willing to take risks

00:16:40.672 --> 00:16:42.656
that they wouldn't otherwise take.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.498
And people are willing to try

00:16:45.522 --> 00:16:49.395
all kinds of high-risk,
high-gain technologies.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.990
So these kinds of crises
might serve the same function

00:16:54.014 --> 00:16:57.228
as the two world wars in the 20th century.

00:16:57.252 --> 00:17:00.464
The two world wars greatly accelerated

00:17:00.488 --> 00:17:04.100
the development of new
and dangerous technologies.

00:17:04.124 --> 00:17:07.408
And the same thing might happen
in the 21st century.

00:17:07.721 --> 00:17:11.618
I mean, you need to be
a little crazy to run too fast,

00:17:11.642 --> 00:17:13.967
let's say, with genetic engineering.

00:17:13.991 --> 00:17:17.101
But now you have more
and more crazy people

00:17:17.125 --> 00:17:19.806
in charge of different
countries in the world,

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:22.897
so the chances are getting
higher, not lower.

00:17:23.647 --> 00:17:27.012
CA: So, putting it all together, Yuval,
you've got this unique vision.

00:17:27.036 --> 00:17:28.623
Roll the clock forward 30 years.

00:17:28.647 --> 00:17:31.910
What's your guess --
does humanity just somehow scrape through,

00:17:31.934 --> 00:17:35.069
look back and say, "Wow,
that was a close thing. We did it!"

00:17:35.093 --> 00:17:36.529
Or not?

00:17:36.553 --> 00:17:40.401
YNH: So far, we've managed
to overcome all the previous crises.

00:17:40.425 --> 00:17:43.244
And especially if you look
at liberal democracy

00:17:43.268 --> 00:17:46.212
and you think things are bad now,

00:17:46.236 --> 00:17:52.702
just remember how much worse
things looked in 1938 or in 1968.

00:17:52.726 --> 00:17:55.717
So this is really nothing,
this is just a small crisis.

00:17:56.167 --> 00:17:58.136
But you can never know,

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.291
because, as a historian,

00:18:00.315 --> 00:18:05.089
I know that you should never
underestimate human stupidity.

00:18:05.113 --> 00:18:06.268
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:18:06.292 --> 00:18:10.296
It is one of the most powerful forces
that shape history.

00:18:11.433 --> 00:18:14.298
CA: Yuval, it's been an absolute delight
to have you with us.

00:18:14.322 --> 00:18:16.139
Thank you for making the virtual trip.

00:18:16.163 --> 00:18:18.036
Have a great evening there in Tel Aviv.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.211
Yuval Harari!

00:18:19.235 --> 00:18:20.611
YNH: Thank you very much.

00:18:20.635 --> 00:18:21.785
(Applause)
