00:00:35.753 --> 00:00:40.796
Ethic and her robot Hedge agree 
to help the resistance leader, Adila,

00:00:40.796 --> 00:00:44.566
sabotage the art-incinerating 
furnace-bots.

00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:45.562
In exchange,

00:00:45.562 --> 00:00:50.346
Adila promises to lead them 
to the first object of Ethic’s quest,

00:00:50.346 --> 00:00:54.677
an artifact called the Node of Power.

00:00:54.677 --> 00:00:57.728
Years ago, there was just 
one furnace-bot.

00:00:57.728 --> 00:01:01.217
It had a 0 inside its furnace 
and an unknown,

00:01:01.217 --> 00:01:04.217
randomly generated serial number.

00:01:04.217 --> 00:01:10.774
Over time, the original self-replicated 
to produce more identical furnace-bots.

00:01:10.774 --> 00:01:16.042
Each child inherited the original’s 
unknown serial number within its furnace,

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:21.509
and had a random, unique serial 
number of its own inscribed on its shell.

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.440
The second generation of furnace-
bots also self-replicated in the same way,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.443
always passing their own serial 
numbers to their offspring’s furnaces.

00:01:31.443 --> 00:01:35.153
This continued on for many generations.

00:01:35.153 --> 00:01:39.632
Today, each furnace-bot receives 
its orders from its parent.

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:45.747
So if Ethic can find the original 0 bot
and somehow change its instructions,

00:01:45.747 --> 00:01:50.176
she could take over 
the entire army, all at once.

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:52.871
Adila has the perfect solution:

00:01:52.871 --> 00:01:56.425
a data crystal that she’s 
been carrying for years,

00:01:56.425 --> 00:01:59.366
waiting for the right moment 
to activate it.

00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:03.460
It contains a program designed 
to gain control of a bot

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.815
and give it new instructions.

00:02:05.815 --> 00:02:09.871
But if it’s uploaded to any furnace-
bot other than the original,

00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:12.741
the 0 bot will override 
the instructions

00:02:12.741 --> 00:02:16.365
and destroy the data crystal 
in the process.

00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:18.760
The feeding is just 
a few minutes away,

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.319
and there’s only one 
chance to get this right.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.568
Fortunately, Hedge’s ability 
to store data can help.

00:02:26.568 --> 00:02:27.773
In programming,

00:02:27.773 --> 00:02:32.117
a piece of information gets 
stored in something called a variable.

00:02:32.117 --> 00:02:38.607
Variables are basically containers that 
hold onto numbers, words, or other values.

00:02:38.607 --> 00:02:45.302
How does Ethic program Hedge to find 
the original 0 bot as quickly as possible?

00:02:45.302 --> 00:02:48.092
Pause now to figure it out for yourself.

00:02:49.956 --> 00:02:51.309
Here’s a hint.

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:55.529
Programs can be written to have 
as many variables as you need,

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:58.870
but you can solve this problem 
with just one.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.664
Hedge can use it to store 
a serial number

00:03:01.664 --> 00:03:05.270
and replace it with a new one 
as often as he needs.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.714
Pause now to figure it out for yourself.

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.568
A key insight here is that Hedge 
doesn’t need to map out the entire

00:03:14.568 --> 00:03:18.491
set of relationships to find 
the original furnace-bot.

00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:22.940
If, for example, he gets lucky and picks 
the original one right away,

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.020
he’ll be done.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.438
But if he starts with any other bot,

00:03:26.438 --> 00:03:30.711
he can still find a path that leads 
straight back to the 0-bot

00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:34.431
by following a simple set of instructions.

00:03:34.431 --> 00:03:38.051
To help craft them, let’s first 
simplify the problem.

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:40.823
Let’s say there were only 
three furnace-bots;

00:03:40.823 --> 00:03:44.632
a parent and two children, but you don’t 
know which is which.

00:03:44.632 --> 00:03:49.409
You could have Hedge pick one 
at random and look inside its furnace.

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:53.249
Now, you know the family tree 
looks like this.

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:57.203
If the number inside the furnace is a 0, 
you’ve found the parent.

00:03:57.203 --> 00:04:00.548
If not, then no matter 
which child you chose,

00:04:00.548 --> 00:04:04.358
it must have the parent’s serial 
number in its furnace.

00:04:04.358 --> 00:04:10.673
So in this scenario, you’re guaranteed 
to find the parent in one or two moves.

00:04:10.673 --> 00:04:13.563
In actuality, there are many 
furnace-bots,

00:04:13.563 --> 00:04:16.246
and you don’t know how 
many generations there are

00:04:16.246 --> 00:04:18.851
nor what the family tree looks like.

00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:20.440
But you don’t need to,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.361
because Hedge can just keep repeating 
the same sequence of actions

00:04:24.361 --> 00:04:26.603
until he gets to the original.

00:04:26.603 --> 00:04:29.012
How? With a loop.

00:04:29.012 --> 00:04:32.892
Hedge can pick any bot at random, 
look inside its furnace,

00:04:32.892 --> 00:04:36.210
and store that serial 
number as a variable.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.615
Then he’ll begin the following 
loop that will repeat

00:04:39.615 --> 00:04:42.321
until the stored variable equals 0,

00:04:42.321 --> 00:04:45.591
the furnace number of the original bot:

00:04:45.591 --> 00:04:51.019
1. Find the bot whose shell serial number 
matches the stored number.

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:53.979
2. Look inside its furnace.

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:59.099
3. Store that new number, 
overwriting the old one.

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:03.439
Once the loop ends, we’ll know 
that Hedge has found the 0 bot,

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:06.124
so he should upload the control program.

00:05:06.124 --> 00:05:07.752
So here’s what happens:

00:05:07.752 --> 00:05:11.481
Hedge only takes 5 repetitions 
to find the original:

00:05:11.481 --> 00:05:15.581
robot 733 has the 0 in its furnace.

00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:17.675
In a blink of a mechanical eye,

00:05:17.675 --> 00:05:22.811
the program spreads through the entire 
army, and Adila takes control.

00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:26.260
She has the furnace-bots 
give off theatrical bouts of flame

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.603
to hide the fact that they’re now secretly
safe-guarding

00:05:29.603 --> 00:05:32.643
all of that artistic output.

00:05:32.643 --> 00:05:35.040
Now that Ethic’s delivered 
the furnace-bots,

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.500
Adila honors her end of the deal.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.401
She leads Ethic and Hedge 
to the location of the first artifact,

00:05:42.401 --> 00:05:44.980
the Node of Power.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.996
There, one thing is immediately clear:

00:05:50.086 --> 00:05:51.806
they’ll have to steal it.
