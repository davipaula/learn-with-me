00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.656
I don't come to you today as an expert.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.616
I come to you as someone
who has been really interested

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.696
in how I get better at what I do

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.960
and how we all do.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.056
I think it's not just
how good you are now,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.960
I think it's how good you're going to be
that really matters.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.616
I was visiting this birth center
in the north of India.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.776
I was watching the birth attendants,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.696
and I realized I was witnessing in them
an extreme form of this very struggle,

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.816
which is how people improve
in the face of complexity --

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.040
or don't.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.736
The women here are delivering in a region

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.080
where the typical birth center
has a one-in-20 death rate for the babies,

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.840
and the moms are dying at a rate
ten times higher than they do elsewhere.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.256
Now, we've known the critical practices

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.800
that stop the big killers
in birth for decades,

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.616
and the thing about it is
that even in this place --

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.056
in this place especially,

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.840
the simplest things are not simple.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.319
We know for example you should wash hands
and put on clean gloves,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.576
but here,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.600
the tap is in another room,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.080
and they don't have clean gloves.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.936
To reuse their gloves,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.720
they wash them in this basin
of dilute bleach,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.360
but you can see there's still blood
on the gloves from the last delivery.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.320
Ten percent of babies are born
with difficulty breathing everywhere.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.696
We know what to do.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.280
You dry the baby with a clean cloth
to stimulate them to breathe.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.616
If they don't start to breathe,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.536
you suction out their airways.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.496
And if that doesn't work,
you give them breaths with the baby mask.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.776
But these are skills that they've learned
mostly from textbooks,

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.120
and that baby mask is broken.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.976
In this one disturbing image for me

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.120
is a picture that brings home
just how dire the situation is.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.376
This is a baby 10 minutes after birth,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.600
and he's alive,

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:23.240
but only just.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.536
No clean cloth,

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.840
has not been dried,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.240
not warming skin to skin,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.600
an unsterile clamp across the cord.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.936
He's an infection waiting to happen,

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.600
and he's losing
his temperature by the minute.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.256
Successful child delivery
requires a successful team of people.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.496
A whole team has to be
skilled and coordinated;

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.496
the nurses who do the deliveries
in a place like this,

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.176
the doctor who backs them up,

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.776
the supply clerk who's responsible
for 22 critical drugs and supplies

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.176
being in stock and at the bedside,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.776
the medical officer in charge,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.800
responsible for the quality
of the whole facility.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.280
The thing is they are all
experienced professionals.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.560
I didn't meet anybody who hadn't been
part of thousands of deliveries.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.056
But against the complexities
that they face,

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.120
they seem to be at their limits.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.720
They were not getting better anymore.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.800
It's how good you're going to be
that really matters.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.720
It presses on a fundamental question.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.320
How do professionals
get better at what they do?

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.136
How do they get great?

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.856
And there are two views about this.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.880
One is the traditional pedagogical view.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.176
That is that you go to school,

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.816
you study, you practice,
you learn, you graduate,

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.496
and then you go out into the world

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.176
and you make your way on your own.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.360
A professional is someone who is capable
of managing their own improvement.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.336
That is the approach that virtually
all professionals have learned by.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.616
That's how doctors learn,

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.056
that's how lawyers do,

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.360
scientists ...

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.720
musicians.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.336
And the thing is, it works.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.536
Consider for example legendary
Juilliard violin instructor Dorothy DeLay.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.256
She trained an amazing roster
of violin virtuosos:

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.816
Midori, Sarah Chang, Itzhak Perlman.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.976
Each of them came to her as young talents,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.079
and they worked with her over years.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.296
What she worked on most, she said,

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.856
was inculcating in them
habits of thinking and of learning

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.616
so that they could make their way
in the world without her

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.840
when they were done.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.240
Now, the contrasting view
comes out of sports.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.920
And they say "You are never done,

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.736
everybody needs a coach."

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.960
Everyone.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.360
The greatest in the world needs a coach.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.440
So I tried to think
about this as a surgeon.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.096
Pay someone to come
into my operating room,

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.200
observe me and critique me.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.320
That seems absurd.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.320
Expertise means not needing to be coached.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.430
So then which view is right?

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.800
I learned that coaching came into sports
as a very American idea.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.416
In 1875,

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.816
Harvard and Yale played one of the very
first American-rules football games.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.680
Yale hired a head coach;

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.800
Harvard did not.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.616
The results?

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.176
Over the next three decades,

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.320
Harvard won just four times.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.296
Harvard hired a coach.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.096
(Laughter)

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.080
And it became the way that sports works.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.496
But is it necessary then?

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.960
Does it transfer into other fields?

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.576
I decided to ask, of all people,

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.840
Itzhak Perlman.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.296
He had trained the Dorothy DeLay way

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.560
and became arguably the greatest
violinist of his generation.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.216
One of the beautiful things about
getting to write for "The New Yorker"

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.056
is I call people up,
and they return my phone calls.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.616
(Laughter)

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.336
And Perlman returned my phone call.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.837
So we ended up having
an almost two-hour conversation

00:06:25.861 --> 00:06:29.341
about how he got
to where he got in his career.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.320
And I asked him, I said,
"Why don't violinists have coaches?"

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.296
And he said, "I don't know,

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.840
but I always had a coach."

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.816
"You always had a coach?"

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.000
"Oh yeah, my wife, Toby."

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.656
They had graduated
together from Juilliard,

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.216
and she had given up her job
as a concert violinist

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.616
to be his coach,

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.096
sitting in the audience,

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.496
observing him and giving him feedback.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.416
"Itzhak, in that middle section,

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.600
you know you sounded
a little bit mechanical.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.020
What can you differently next time?"

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.400
It was crucial to everything
he became, he said.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.080
Turns out there are numerous problems
in making it on your own.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.376
You don't recognize the issues
that are standing in your way

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.616
or if you do,

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.776
you don't necessarily
know how to fix them.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.936
And the result is
that somewhere along the way,

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.560
you stop improving.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.096
And I thought about that,

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.760
and I realized that was exactly
what had happened to me as a surgeon.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.016
I'd entered practice in 2003,

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.616
and for the first several years,

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.016
it was just this steady, upward
improvement in my learning curve.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.136
I watched my complication rates drop
from one year to the next.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.896
And after about five years,

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.120
they leveled out.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.696
And a few more years after that,

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.480
I realized I wasn't getting
any better anymore.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.920
And I thought: "Is this
as good as I'm going to get?"

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.280
So I thought a little more and I said ...

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.440
"OK,

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.280
I'll try a coach."

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.496
So I asked a former professor
of mine who had retired,

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.336
his name is Bob Osteen,

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.216
and he agreed to come to my operating room

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.440
and observe me.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.496
The case --

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.856
I remember that first case.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.336
It went beautifully.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.216
I didn't think there would be
anything much he'd have to say

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.576
when we were done.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.296
Instead, he had a whole page
dense with notes.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.136
(Laughter)

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.736
"Just small things," he said.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.856
(Laughter)

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.800
But it's the small things that matter.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.416
"Did you notice that the light
had swung out of the wound

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.816
during the case?

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.576
You spent about half an hour

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.960
just operating off the light
from reflected surfaces."

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.616
"Another thing I noticed," he said,

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.936
"Your elbow goes up in the air
every once in a while.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.616
That means you're not in full control.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.656
A surgeon's elbows should be down
at their sides resting comfortably.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.256
So that means if you feel
your elbow going in the air,

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.520
you should get a different instrument,
or just move your feet."

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.960
It was a whole other level of awareness.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.000
And I had to think,

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.080
you know, there was something
fundamentally profound about this.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.896
He was describing what great coaches do,

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.936
and what they do is they are
your external eyes and ears,

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.360
providing a more accurate
picture of your reality.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.040
They're recognizing the fundamentals.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.976
They're breaking your actions down

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.400
and then helping you
build them back up again.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.816
After two months of coaching,

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.080
I felt myself getting better again.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.856
And after a year,

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.720
I saw my complications
drop down even further.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.880
It was painful.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.976
I didn't like being observed,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.056
and at times I didn't want
to have to work on things.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.640
I also felt there were periods where
I would get worse before I got better.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.536
But it made me realize

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.160
that the coaches were onto something
profoundly important.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.936
In my other work,

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.496
I lead a health systems innovation center
called Ariadne Labs,

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.456
where we work on problems
in the delivery of health care,

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.080
including global childbirth.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.856
As part of it,

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.136
we had worked with
the World Health Organization

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.000
to devise a safe childbirth checklist.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.536
It lays out the fundamentals.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.216
It breaks down the fundamentals --

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.056
the critical actions
a team needs to go through

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.376
when a woman comes in in labor,

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.336
when she's ready to push,

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.016
when the baby is out,

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.480
and then when the mom and baby
are ready to go home.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.656
And we knew

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.856
that just handing out a checklist
wasn't going to change very much,

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.096
and even just teaching it in the classroom
wasn't necessarily going to be enough

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.136
to get people to make the changes
that you needed to bring it alive.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.856
And I thought on my experience and said,

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.214
"What if we tried coaching?

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.120
What if we tried coaching
at a massive scale?"

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.336
We found some incredible partners,

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.056
including the government of India,

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.936
and we ran a trial there
in 120 birth centers.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.936
In Uttar Pradesh,
in India's largest state.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.976
Half of the centers
basically we just observed,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.936
but the other half
got visits from coaches.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.736
We trained an army
of doctors and nurses like this one

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:34.096
who learned to observe the care
and also the managers

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.416
and then help them
build on their strengths

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.080
and address their weaknesses.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.936
One of the skills for example
they had to work on with people --

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.016
turned out to be
fundamentally important --

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.256
was communication.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.656
Getting the nurses to practice speaking up
when the baby mask is broken

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.136
or the gloves are not in stock

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.976
or someone's not washing their hands.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.256
And then getting others,
including the managers,

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.520
to practice listening.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.736
This small army of coaches
ended up coaching 400 nurses

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.176
and other birth attendants,

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.200
and 100 physicians and managers.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.920
We tracked the results
across 160,000 births.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.480
The results ...

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.536
in the control group you had --

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.896
and these are the ones
who did not get coaching --

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.776
they delivered on only one-third
of 18 basic practices

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.056
that we were measuring.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.976
And most important was
over the course of the years of study,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.040
we saw no improvement over time.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.256
The other folks
got four months of coaching

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.616
and then it tapered off over eight months,

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.456
and we saw them increase

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.960
to greater than two-thirds
of the practices being delivered.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.856
It works.

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.176
We could see the improvement in quality,

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.016
and you could see it happen
across a whole range of centers

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.256
that suggested that coaching
could be a whole line of way

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.520
that we bring value to what we do.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.256
You can imagine the whole job category
that could reach out in the world

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.760
and that millions of people could fulfill.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.456
We were clearly
at the beginning of it, though,

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.576
because there was still a distance to go.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.816
You have to put
all of the checklist together

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.216
to achieve the substantial
reductions in mortality.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.936
But we began seeing the first places
that were getting there,

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.896
and this center was one of them

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.320
because coaching helped them
learn to execute on the fundamentals.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.840
And you could see it here.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.136
This is a 23-year-old woman

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.256
who had come in by ambulance,

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.560
in labor with her third child.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:41.296
She broke her water in the triage area,

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.696
so they brought her directly
to the labor and delivery room,

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.616
and then they ran through their checks.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.336
I put the time stamp on here

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.256
so you could see
how quickly all of this happens

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.920
and how much more complicated
that makes things.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.856
Within four minutes,

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.056
they had taken the blood pressure,
measured her pulse

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.800
and also measured
the heart rate of the baby.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.776
That meant that the blood pressure cuff
and the fetal Doppler monitor,

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.496
they were all there,
and the nurse knew how to use them.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.480
The team was skilled and coordinated.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.496
The mom was doing great,

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.800
the baby's heart rate was 143,
which is normal.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.976
Eight minutes later, the intensity
of the contractions picked up,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.136
so the nurse washed her hands,

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.776
put on clean gloves,

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.216
examined her and found
that her cervix was fully dilated.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.920
The baby was ready to come.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:33.256
She then went straight over
to do her next set of checks.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.536
All of the equipment,
she worked her way through

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.376
and made sure she had everything
she needed at the bedside.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.456
The baby mask was there,
the sterile towel,

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.856
the sterile equipment that you needed.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:48.416
And then three minutes later,
one push and that baby was out.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.120
(Applause)

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.456
I was watching this delivery,

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.320
and suddenly I realized that the mood
in that room had changed.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.696
The nurse was looking
at the community health worker

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.176
who had come in with the woman

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.880
because that baby
did not seem to be alive.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.800
She was blue and floppy and not breathing.

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.880
She would be one of that one-in-20.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.856
But the nurse kept going
with her checkpoints.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.776
She dried that baby with a clean towel.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.656
And after a minute,
when that didn't stimulate that baby,

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.856
she ran to get the baby mask

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.456
and the other one went to get the suction.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.096
She didn't have a mechanical suction
because you could count on electricity,

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.496
so she used a mouth suction,

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.776
and within 20 seconds,

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.736
she was clearing out
that little girl's airways.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.656
And she got back a green, thick liquid,

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.776
and within a minute
of being able to do that

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.416
and suctioning out over and over,

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.856
that baby started to breathe.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:52.080
(Applause)

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.160
Another minute and that baby was crying.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.416
And five minutes after that,

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.696
she was pink and warming
on her mother's chest,

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.816
and that mother reached out
to grab that nurse's hand,

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.600
and they could all breathe.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.480
I saw a team transformed
because of coaching.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.680
And I saw at least one life
saved because of it.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.736
We followed up with that mother
a few months later.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.800
Mom and baby were doing great.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.240
The baby's name is Anshika.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.920
It means "beautiful."

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.816
And she is what's possible

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.536
when we really understand

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.840
how people get better at what they do.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.936
Thank you.

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.280
(Applause)
