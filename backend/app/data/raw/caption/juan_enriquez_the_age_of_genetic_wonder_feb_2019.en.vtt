00:00:13.134 --> 00:00:15.524
So let me with start with Roy Amara.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.561
Roy's argument is that most new
technologies tend to be overestimated

00:00:20.585 --> 00:00:22.653
in their impact to begin with,

00:00:22.677 --> 00:00:25.079
and then they get underestimated
in the long term

00:00:25.103 --> 00:00:26.467
because we get used to them.

00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:28.687
These really are days
of miracle and wonder.

00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:31.814
You remember that wonderful
song by Paul Simon?

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:33.703
There were two lines in it.

00:00:33.727 --> 00:00:37.414
So what was it that was considered
miraculous back then?

00:00:38.393 --> 00:00:40.465
Slowing down things -- slow motion --

00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:43.099
and the long-distance call.

00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:46.800
Because, of course, you used
to get interrupted by operators

00:00:46.824 --> 00:00:49.821
who'd tell you, "Long distance calling.
Do you want to hang up?"

00:00:49.845 --> 00:00:52.547
And now we think nothing of calling
all over the world.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.670
Well, something similar may be happening

00:00:55.694 --> 00:00:57.766
with reading and programming life.

00:00:58.636 --> 00:01:00.364
But before I unpack that,

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:03.753
let's just talk about telescopes.

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:09.109
Telescopes were overestimated
originally in their impact.

00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.302
This is one of Galileo's early models.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.449
People thought it was just
going to ruin all religion.

00:01:15.473 --> 00:01:16.623
(Laughter)

00:01:18.862 --> 00:01:21.576
So we're not paying that much
attention to telescopes.

00:01:22.628 --> 00:01:26.710
But, of course, telescopes launched
10 years ago, as you just heard,

00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:29.725
could take this Volkswagen,
fly it to the moon,

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:35.605
and you could see the lights
on that Volkswagen light up on the moon.

00:01:36.624 --> 00:01:39.886
And that's the kind of resolution power
that allowed you to see

00:01:40.592 --> 00:01:44.196
little specks of dust
floating around distant suns.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.684
Imagine for a second that this
was a sun a billion light years away,

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.237
and you had a little speck of dust
that came in front of it.

00:01:51.566 --> 00:01:54.067
That's what detecting
an exoplanet is like.

00:01:55.268 --> 00:01:59.058
And the cool thing is, the telescopes
that are now being launched

00:02:00.138 --> 00:02:03.143
would allow you to see
a single candle lit on the moon.

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:07.107
And if you separated it by one plate,

00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:09.925
you could see two candles
separately at that distance.

00:02:11.124 --> 00:02:13.937
And that's the kind
of resolution that you need

00:02:13.961 --> 00:02:16.429
to begin to image
that little speck of dust

00:02:16.453 --> 00:02:17.739
as it comes around the sun

00:02:17.763 --> 00:02:19.812
and see if it has a blue-green signature.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.191
And if it does have
a blue-green signature,

00:02:23.215 --> 00:02:25.435
it means that life
is common in the universe.

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.655
The first time you ever see a blue-green
signature on a distant planet,

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:31.672
it means there's photosynthesis there,

00:02:31.696 --> 00:02:32.977
there's water there,

00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:36.873
and the chances that you saw
the only other planet with photosynthesis

00:02:36.897 --> 00:02:38.260
are about zero.

00:02:39.108 --> 00:02:41.004
And that's a calendar-changing event.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.422
There's a before and after
we were alone in the universe:

00:02:44.446 --> 00:02:46.916
forget about the discovery
of whatever continent.

00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:50.331
So as you're thinking about this,

00:02:50.355 --> 00:02:53.257
we're now beginning
to be able to image most of the universe.

00:02:53.281 --> 00:02:55.535
And that is a time of miracle and wonder.

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:57.911
And we kind of take that for granted.

00:02:59.562 --> 00:03:01.477
Something similar is happening in life.

00:03:01.501 --> 00:03:04.539
So we're hearing about life
in these little bits and pieces.

00:03:04.563 --> 00:03:07.221
We hear about CRISPR,
and we hear about this technology,

00:03:07.245 --> 00:03:08.911
and we hear about this technology.

00:03:08.935 --> 00:03:12.323
But the bottom line on life
is that life turns out to be code.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.850
And life as code is a really
important concept because it means,

00:03:17.874 --> 00:03:21.084
just in the same way
as you can write a sentence

00:03:21.108 --> 00:03:24.226
in English or in French or Chinese,

00:03:25.146 --> 00:03:28.052
just in the same way
as you can copy a sentence,

00:03:28.076 --> 00:03:30.602
just in the same way
as you can edit a sentence,

00:03:30.626 --> 00:03:32.976
just in the same way
as you can print a sentence,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.719
you're beginning to be able
to do that with life.

00:03:37.237 --> 00:03:40.748
It means that we're beginning
to learn how to read this language.

00:03:40.772 --> 00:03:44.008
And this, of course, is the language
that is used by this orange.

00:03:44.702 --> 00:03:46.498
So how does this orange execute code?

00:03:46.522 --> 00:03:49.230
It doesn't do it in ones and zeroes
like a computer does.

00:03:49.254 --> 00:03:51.139
It sits on a tree, and one day it does:

00:03:51.163 --> 00:03:52.313
plop!

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.624
And that means: execute.

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:58.421
AATCAAG: make me a little root.

00:03:59.057 --> 00:04:01.559
TCGACC: make me a little stem.

00:04:01.583 --> 00:04:05.021
GAC: make me some leaves.
AGC: make me some flowers.

00:04:05.045 --> 00:04:07.902
And then GCAA: make me some more oranges.

00:04:08.984 --> 00:04:13.057
If I edit a sentence in English
on a word processor,

00:04:15.153 --> 00:04:18.594
then what happens is you can go
from this word to that word.

00:04:20.134 --> 00:04:22.270
If I edit something in this orange

00:04:22.294 --> 00:04:27.277
and put in GCAAC, using CRISPR
or something else that you've heard of,

00:04:28.261 --> 00:04:30.058
then this orange becomes a lemon,

00:04:30.957 --> 00:04:32.505
or it becomes a grapefruit,

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:34.186
or it becomes a tangerine.

00:04:35.102 --> 00:04:37.120
And if I edit one in a thousand letters,

00:04:37.144 --> 00:04:39.504
you become the person
sitting next to you today.

00:04:40.757 --> 00:04:42.277
Be more careful where you sit.

00:04:42.301 --> 00:04:43.490
(Laughter)

00:04:45.014 --> 00:04:48.489
What's happening on this stuff
is it was really expensive to begin with.

00:04:48.513 --> 00:04:50.208
It was like long-distance calls.

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:55.005
But the cost of this is dropping
50 percent faster than Moore's law.

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:59.741
The first $200 full genome
was announced yesterday by Veritas.

00:05:00.494 --> 00:05:02.624
And so as you're looking at these systems,

00:05:02.648 --> 00:05:06.450
it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter,
it doesn't matter, and then it does.

00:05:06.474 --> 00:05:09.879
So let me just give you
the map view of this stuff.

00:05:10.973 --> 00:05:13.532
This is a big discovery.

00:05:13.556 --> 00:05:15.479
There's 23 chromosomes.

00:05:15.503 --> 00:05:16.731
Cool.

00:05:17.287 --> 00:05:20.966
Let's now start using a telescope version,
but instead of using a telescope,

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.310
let's use a microscope to zoom in

00:05:23.334 --> 00:05:25.406
on the inferior of those chromosomes,

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.051
which is the Y chromosome.

00:05:28.432 --> 00:05:31.446
It's a third the size of the X.
It's recessive and mutant.

00:05:32.443 --> 00:05:33.594
But hey,

00:05:34.262 --> 00:05:35.481
just a male.

00:05:36.914 --> 00:05:39.194
And as you're looking at this stuff,

00:05:39.218 --> 00:05:42.668
here's kind of a country view

00:05:42.692 --> 00:05:44.896
at a 400 base pair resolution level,

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.339
and then you zoom in to 550,
and then you zoom in to 850,

00:05:48.363 --> 00:05:51.648
and you can begin to identify
more and more genes as you zoom in.

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:54.553
Then you zoom in to the state level,

00:05:55.473 --> 00:05:58.277
and you can begin to tell
who's got leukemia,

00:05:59.543 --> 00:06:02.567
how did they get leukemia,
what kind of leukemia do they have,

00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:04.655
what shifted from what place
to what place.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.188
And then you zoom in
to the Google street view level.

00:06:09.387 --> 00:06:12.060
So this is what happens
if you have colorectal cancer

00:06:12.084 --> 00:06:16.291
for a very specific patient
on the letter-by-letter resolution.

00:06:18.148 --> 00:06:21.258
So what we're doing in this stuff
is we're gathering information

00:06:21.282 --> 00:06:23.798
and just generating
enormous amounts of information.

00:06:23.822 --> 00:06:26.696
This is one of the largest
databases on the planet

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.592
and it's growing faster
than we can build computers to store it.

00:06:32.063 --> 00:06:34.529
You can create some incredible
maps with this stuff.

00:06:35.292 --> 00:06:38.263
You want to understand the plague
and why one plague is bubonic

00:06:38.287 --> 00:06:40.511
and the other one
is a different kind of plague

00:06:40.535 --> 00:06:42.845
and the other one
is a different kind of plague?

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:44.599
Well, here's a map of the plague.

00:06:45.037 --> 00:06:46.857
Some are absolutely deadly to humans,

00:06:46.881 --> 00:06:48.066
some are not.

00:06:48.486 --> 00:06:51.082
And note, by the way,
as you go to the bottom of this,

00:06:51.106 --> 00:06:52.859
how does it compare to tuberculosis?

00:06:53.708 --> 00:06:57.337
So this is the difference between
tuberculosis and various kinds of plagues,

00:06:57.361 --> 00:06:59.696
and you can play detective
with this stuff,

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.195
because you can take
a very specific kind of cholera

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:03.409
that affected Haiti,

00:07:04.377 --> 00:07:07.063
and you can look at
which country it came from,

00:07:07.087 --> 00:07:08.813
which region it came from,

00:07:09.496 --> 00:07:14.238
and probably which soldier took that
from that African country to Haiti.

00:07:17.133 --> 00:07:18.645
Zoom out.

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:20.240
It's not just zooming in.

00:07:21.042 --> 00:07:23.896
This is one of the coolest maps
ever done by human beings.

00:07:24.446 --> 00:07:27.502
What they've done is taken
all the genetic information they have

00:07:27.526 --> 00:07:29.007
about all the species,

00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:32.461
and they've put a tree of life
on a single page

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:34.063
that you can zoom in and out of.

00:07:34.484 --> 00:07:38.205
So this is what came first,
how did it diversify, how did it branch,

00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:39.459
how large is that genome,

00:07:39.483 --> 00:07:40.680
on a single page.

00:07:41.619 --> 00:07:43.682
It's kind of the universe
of life on Earth,

00:07:43.706 --> 00:07:46.155
and it's being constantly
updated and completed.

00:07:46.982 --> 00:07:48.841
And so as you're looking at this stuff,

00:07:48.865 --> 00:07:52.216
the really important change is
the old biology used to be reactive.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.960
You used to have a lot of biologists
that had microscopes,

00:07:54.984 --> 00:07:58.283
and they had magnifying glasses
and they were out observing animals.

00:07:58.897 --> 00:08:00.766
The new biology is proactive.

00:08:01.433 --> 00:08:04.452
You don't just observe stuff,
you make stuff.

00:08:05.135 --> 00:08:06.783
And that's a really big change

00:08:06.807 --> 00:08:09.616
because it allows us
to do things like this.

00:08:10.559 --> 00:08:13.026
And I know you're really
excited by this picture.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:14.161
(Laughter)

00:08:14.185 --> 00:08:16.559
It only took us four years
and 40 million dollars

00:08:16.583 --> 00:08:18.185
to be able to take this picture.

00:08:18.209 --> 00:08:19.439
(Laughter)

00:08:19.463 --> 00:08:20.834
And what we did

00:08:21.586 --> 00:08:24.861
is we took the full gene code
out of a cell --

00:08:24.885 --> 00:08:28.796
not a gene, not two genes,
the full gene code out of a cell --

00:08:30.016 --> 00:08:31.856
built a completely new gene code,

00:08:32.825 --> 00:08:34.400
inserted it into the cell,

00:08:34.424 --> 00:08:37.356
figured out a way to have the cell
execute that code

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.634
and built a completely new species.

00:08:40.884 --> 00:08:43.369
So this is the world's first
synthetic life form.

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:47.705
And so what do you do with this stuff?

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.634
Well, this stuff is going
to change the world.

00:08:51.417 --> 00:08:53.356
Let me give you three short-term trends

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.635
in terms of how it's going
to change the world.

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:59.190
The first is we're going to see
a new industrial revolution.

00:08:59.674 --> 00:09:01.375
And I actually mean that literally.

00:09:01.992 --> 00:09:06.483
So in the same way as Switzerland
and Germany and Britain

00:09:06.507 --> 00:09:10.165
changed the world with machines
like the one you see in this lobby,

00:09:11.537 --> 00:09:12.733
created power --

00:09:13.273 --> 00:09:15.937
in the same way CERN
is changing the world,

00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:19.308
using new instruments
and our concept of the universe --

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.954
programmable life forms
are also going to change the world

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.465
because once you can program cells

00:09:25.489 --> 00:09:28.017
in the same way as you
program your computer chip,

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:31.429
then you can make almost anything.

00:09:32.369 --> 00:09:35.148
So your computer chip
can produce photographs,

00:09:35.172 --> 00:09:37.245
can produce music, can produce film,

00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:39.682
can produce love letters,
can produce spreadsheets.

00:09:39.706 --> 00:09:41.950
It's just ones and zeroes
flying through there.

00:09:42.604 --> 00:09:45.209
If you can flow ATCGs through cells,

00:09:46.123 --> 00:09:49.177
then this software makes its own hardware,

00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:51.273
which means it scales very quickly.

00:09:52.487 --> 00:09:54.138
No matter what happens,

00:09:54.162 --> 00:09:56.320
if you leave your cell phone
by your bedside,

00:09:56.344 --> 00:09:58.930
you will not have a billion
cell phones in the morning.

00:09:59.489 --> 00:10:04.402
But if you do that with living organisms,

00:10:05.222 --> 00:10:07.611
you can make this stuff
at a very large scale.

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.286
One of the things you can do
is you can start producing

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:14.533
close to carbon-neutral fuels

00:10:14.557 --> 00:10:16.983
on a commercial scale by 2025,

00:10:18.054 --> 00:10:19.815
which we're doing with Exxon.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.279
But you can also substitute
for agricultural lands.

00:10:23.303 --> 00:10:28.054
Instead of having 100 hectares
to make oils or to make proteins,

00:10:28.078 --> 00:10:29.937
you can make it in these vats

00:10:29.961 --> 00:10:32.829
at 10 or 100 times
the productivity per hectare.

00:10:33.488 --> 00:10:36.870
Or you can store information,
or you can make all the world's vaccines

00:10:36.894 --> 00:10:38.193
in those three vats.

00:10:39.276 --> 00:10:43.225
Or you can store most of the information
that's held at CERN in those three vats.

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:47.559
DNA is a really powerful
information storage device.

00:10:48.806 --> 00:10:50.394
Second turn:

00:10:50.418 --> 00:10:53.202
you're beginning to see the rise
of theoretical biology.

00:10:54.256 --> 00:10:58.458
So, medical school departments are one
of the most conservative places on earth.

00:10:58.482 --> 00:11:01.899
The way they teach anatomy is similar
to the way they taught anatomy

00:11:01.923 --> 00:11:03.089
100 years ago.

00:11:03.113 --> 00:11:05.137
"Welcome, student. Here's your cadaver."

00:11:06.149 --> 00:11:09.856
One of the things medical schools are
not good at is creating new departments,

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.629
which is why this is so unusual.

00:11:12.351 --> 00:11:18.849
Isaac Kohane has now created a department
based on informatics, data, knowledge

00:11:18.873 --> 00:11:20.384
at Harvard Medical School.

00:11:21.408 --> 00:11:23.585
And in a sense,
what's beginning to happen is

00:11:23.609 --> 00:11:26.091
biology is beginning to get enough data

00:11:26.115 --> 00:11:28.881
that it can begin to follow
the steps of physics,

00:11:28.905 --> 00:11:32.293
which used to be observational physics

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:34.288
and experimental physicists,

00:11:34.312 --> 00:11:36.474
and then started creating
theoretical biology.

00:11:36.498 --> 00:11:38.502
Well, that's what you're beginning to see

00:11:38.526 --> 00:11:40.506
because you have so many medical records,

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.562
because you have
so much data about people:

00:11:42.586 --> 00:11:44.996
you've got their genomes,
you've got their viromes,

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.514
you've got their microbiomes.

00:11:46.538 --> 00:11:48.519
And as this information stacks,

00:11:48.543 --> 00:11:50.606
you can begin to make predictions.

00:11:52.149 --> 00:11:55.404
The third thing that's happening
is this is coming to the consumer.

00:11:56.629 --> 00:12:00.785
So you, too, can get your genes sequenced.

00:12:01.698 --> 00:12:04.426
And this is beginning to create
companies like 23andMe,

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:06.928
and companies like 23andMe
are going to be giving you

00:12:06.952 --> 00:12:08.304
more and more and more data,

00:12:08.328 --> 00:12:09.872
not just about your relatives,

00:12:10.562 --> 00:12:11.922
but about you and your body,

00:12:11.946 --> 00:12:13.477
and it's going to compare stuff,

00:12:13.501 --> 00:12:15.594
and it's going
to compare stuff across time,

00:12:15.618 --> 00:12:18.225
and these are going to become
very large databases.

00:12:18.249 --> 00:12:21.211
But it's also beginning to affect
a series of other businesses

00:12:21.235 --> 00:12:22.772
in unexpected ways.

00:12:23.802 --> 00:12:27.553
Normally, when you advertise something,
you really don't want the consumer

00:12:27.577 --> 00:12:32.144
to take your advertisement
into the bathroom to pee on.

00:12:33.993 --> 00:12:36.048
Unless, of course, if you're IKEA.

00:12:37.381 --> 00:12:40.287
Because when you rip this
out of a magazine and you pee on it,

00:12:40.311 --> 00:12:42.380
it'll turn blue if you're pregnant.

00:12:42.404 --> 00:12:43.617
(Laughter)

00:12:44.214 --> 00:12:48.087
And they'll give you
a discount on your crib.

00:12:48.111 --> 00:12:49.269
(Laughter)

00:12:49.293 --> 00:12:51.308
Right? So when I say consumer empowerment,

00:12:51.332 --> 00:12:54.071
and this is spreading beyond biotech,

00:12:54.095 --> 00:12:55.914
I actually really mean that.

00:12:58.273 --> 00:13:01.638
We're now beginning to produce,
at Synthetic Genomics,

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.011
desktop printers

00:13:05.228 --> 00:13:08.758
that allow you to design a cell,

00:13:08.782 --> 00:13:09.949
print a cell,

00:13:09.973 --> 00:13:11.818
execute the program on the cell.

00:13:12.825 --> 00:13:14.928
We can now print vaccines

00:13:14.952 --> 00:13:17.199
real time as an airplane takes off

00:13:17.223 --> 00:13:18.413
before it lands.

00:13:19.929 --> 00:13:22.501
We're shipping 78
of these machines this year.

00:13:24.068 --> 00:13:28.541
This is not theoretical biology.
This is printing biology.

00:13:30.182 --> 00:13:32.378
Let me talk about two long-term trends

00:13:33.374 --> 00:13:36.700
that are coming at you
over a longer time period.

00:13:37.658 --> 00:13:40.314
The first one is, we're starting
to redesign species.

00:13:41.055 --> 00:13:42.832
And you've heard about that, right?

00:13:42.856 --> 00:13:45.537
We're redesigning trees.
We're redesigning flowers.

00:13:45.561 --> 00:13:47.854
We're redesigning yogurt,

00:13:48.513 --> 00:13:50.543
cheese, whatever else you want.

00:13:51.678 --> 00:13:54.328
And that, of course,
brings up the interesting question:

00:13:54.884 --> 00:13:57.220
How and when should we redesign humans?

00:13:59.566 --> 00:14:03.123
And a lot of us think,
"Oh no, we never want to redesign humans."

00:14:04.147 --> 00:14:06.862
Unless, of course, if your child
has a Huntington's gene

00:14:06.886 --> 00:14:08.275
and is condemned to death.

00:14:09.172 --> 00:14:12.535
Or, unless if you're passing on
a cystic fibrosis gene,

00:14:12.559 --> 00:14:15.249
in which case, you don't just want
to redesign yourself,

00:14:15.273 --> 00:14:17.812
you want to redesign your children
and their children.

00:14:18.723 --> 00:14:22.368
And these are complicated debates
and they're going to happen in real time.

00:14:22.839 --> 00:14:24.790
I'll give you one current example.

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:28.603
One of the debates going on
at the National Academies today

00:14:29.896 --> 00:14:34.598
is you have the power to put
a gene drive into mosquitoes

00:14:34.622 --> 00:14:37.606
so that you will kill
all the malaria-carrying mosquitoes.

00:14:39.547 --> 00:14:42.107
Now, some people say,

00:14:42.964 --> 00:14:46.429
"That's going to affect the environment
in an extreme way, don't do it."

00:14:47.326 --> 00:14:48.481
Other people say,

00:14:48.505 --> 00:14:51.732
"This is one of the things
that's killing millions of people yearly.

00:14:51.756 --> 00:14:55.304
Who are you to tell me
that I can't save the kids in my country?"

00:14:57.183 --> 00:14:59.036
And why is this debate so complicated?

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.941
Because as soon as you
let this loose in Brazil

00:15:01.965 --> 00:15:03.388
or in Southern Florida --

00:15:03.412 --> 00:15:04.953
mosquitoes don't respect walls.

00:15:04.977 --> 00:15:07.278
You're making a decision for the world

00:15:07.302 --> 00:15:09.209
when you put a gene drive into the air.

00:15:14.145 --> 00:15:16.240
This wonderful man won a Nobel Prize,

00:15:17.103 --> 00:15:18.743
and after winning the Nobel Prize

00:15:18.767 --> 00:15:20.022
he's been worrying about

00:15:21.531 --> 00:15:23.634
how did life get started on this planet

00:15:23.658 --> 00:15:25.939
and how likely is it
that it's in other places?

00:15:27.097 --> 00:15:30.299
So what he's been doing is going around
to this graduate students

00:15:30.323 --> 00:15:32.041
and saying to his graduate students,

00:15:32.864 --> 00:15:36.186
"Build me life but don't use
any modern chemicals or instruments.

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:38.875
Build me stuff that was here
three billion years ago.

00:15:38.899 --> 00:15:42.055
You can't use lasers.
You can't use this. You can't use that."

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.575
He gave me a vial of what he's built
about three weeks ago.

00:15:48.639 --> 00:15:49.818
What has he built?

00:15:49.842 --> 00:15:53.867
He's built basically what looked like
soap bubbles that are made out of lipids.

00:15:53.891 --> 00:15:56.457
He's built a precursor of RNA.

00:15:57.291 --> 00:16:01.043
He's had the precursor of the RNA
be absorbed by the cell

00:16:02.194 --> 00:16:04.077
and then he's had the cells divide.

00:16:06.031 --> 00:16:07.988
We may not be that far --

00:16:09.687 --> 00:16:12.804
call it a decade, maybe two decades --

00:16:12.828 --> 00:16:14.798
from generating life from scratch

00:16:16.285 --> 00:16:18.088
out of proto-communities.

00:16:19.512 --> 00:16:21.158
Second long-term trend:

00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:25.799
we've been living and are living
through the digital age --

00:16:25.823 --> 00:16:28.342
we're starting to live through
the age of the genome

00:16:28.366 --> 00:16:31.981
and biology and CRISPR
and synthetic biology --

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:35.777
and all of that is going to merge
into the age of the brain.

00:16:36.743 --> 00:16:40.724
So we're getting to the point where
we can rebuild most of our body parts,

00:16:40.748 --> 00:16:44.404
in the same way as if you break a bone
or burn your skin, it regrows.

00:16:44.428 --> 00:16:47.096
We're beginning to learn
how to regrow our tracheas

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.984
or how to regrow our bladders.

00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:51.314
Both of those have been
implanted in humans.

00:16:51.338 --> 00:16:54.066
Tony Atala is working on
32 different organs.

00:16:55.487 --> 00:16:57.377
But the core is going to be this,

00:16:57.401 --> 00:17:00.455
because this is you
and the rest is just packaging.

00:17:02.011 --> 00:17:05.558
Nobody's going to live beyond
120, 130, 140 years

00:17:05.582 --> 00:17:07.317
unless if we fix this.

00:17:08.084 --> 00:17:10.150
And that's the most interesting challenge.

00:17:10.174 --> 00:17:12.285
That's the next frontier, along with:

00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:14.656
"How common is life in the universe?"

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.486
"Where did we come from?"

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.144
and questions like that.

00:17:20.031 --> 00:17:23.221
Let me end this with
an apocryphal quote from Einstein.

00:17:23.697 --> 00:17:25.916
[You can live as if
everything is a miracle,

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.212
or you can live as if
nothing is a miracle.]

00:17:28.236 --> 00:17:29.749
It's your choice.

00:17:30.555 --> 00:17:33.034
You can focus on the bad,
you can focus on the scary,

00:17:33.058 --> 00:17:35.474
and certainly there's
a lot of scary out there.

00:17:36.012 --> 00:17:40.744
But use 10 percent of your brain
to focus on that, or maybe 20 percent,

00:17:40.768 --> 00:17:42.594
or maybe 30 percent.

00:17:43.474 --> 00:17:45.256
But just remember,

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.889
we really are living in an age
of miracle and wonder.

00:17:48.271 --> 00:17:51.822
We're lucky to be alive today.
We're lucky to see this stuff.

00:17:51.846 --> 00:17:54.687
We're lucky to be able to interact
with folks like the folks

00:17:54.711 --> 00:17:56.821
who are building
all the stuff in this room.

00:17:57.487 --> 00:18:00.462
So thank you to all of you,
for all you do.

00:18:01.066 --> 00:18:04.762
(Applause)
