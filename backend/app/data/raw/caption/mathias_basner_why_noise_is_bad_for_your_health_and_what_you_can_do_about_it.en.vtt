00:00:17.331 --> 00:00:19.048
Do you hear that?

00:00:21.777 --> 00:00:23.570
Do you know what that is?

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.333
Silence.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.794
The sound of silence.

00:00:29.448 --> 00:00:32.142
Simon and Garfunkel wrote a song about it.

00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:35.311
But silence is a pretty
rare commodity these days,

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:39.118
and we're all paying a price for it
in terms of our health --

00:00:39.142 --> 00:00:42.046
a surprisingly big price, as it turns out.

00:00:42.836 --> 00:00:46.609
Luckily, there are things
we can do right now,

00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:49.515
both individually and as a society,

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.420
to better protect our health

00:00:51.444 --> 00:00:55.506
and give us more of the benefits
of the sounds of silence.

00:00:56.727 --> 00:01:00.735
I assume that most of you know that
too much noise is bad for your hearing.

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:04.627
Whenever you leave a concert or a bar
and you have that ringing in your ears,

00:01:04.651 --> 00:01:07.892
you can be certain that you have done
some damage to your hearing,

00:01:07.916 --> 00:01:09.066
likely permanent.

00:01:09.632 --> 00:01:11.163
And that's very important.

00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:16.413
However, noise affects our health
in many different ways beyond hearing.

00:01:17.096 --> 00:01:18.638
They're less well-known,

00:01:18.662 --> 00:01:21.916
but they're just as dangerous
as the auditory effects.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.941
So what do we mean
when we talk about noise?

00:01:26.287 --> 00:01:29.380
Well, noise is defined as unwanted sound,

00:01:29.404 --> 00:01:33.001
and as such, both has
a physical component, the sound,

00:01:33.025 --> 00:01:35.014
and a psychological component,

00:01:35.038 --> 00:01:38.240
the circumstances that make
the sound unwanted.

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:40.559
A very good example is a rock concert.

00:01:40.955 --> 00:01:45.310
A person attending the rock concert,
being exposed to 100 decibels,

00:01:45.334 --> 00:01:47.487
does not think of the music as noise.

00:01:48.043 --> 00:01:51.985
This person likes the band, and even
paid a hundred dollars for the ticket,

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.977
so no matter how loud the music,
this person doesn't think of it as noise.

00:01:56.752 --> 00:02:01.370
In contrast, think of a person living
three blocks away from the concert hall.

00:02:01.902 --> 00:02:04.105
That person is trying to read a book,

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:07.071
but cannot concentrate
because of the music.

00:02:07.095 --> 00:02:10.809
And although the sound pressure levels
are much lower in this situation,

00:02:10.833 --> 00:02:13.649
this person still thinks
of the music as noise,

00:02:13.673 --> 00:02:19.516
and it may trigger reactions that can,
in the long run, have health consequences.

00:02:21.405 --> 00:02:24.010
So why are quiet spaces so important?

00:02:24.656 --> 00:02:28.617
Because noise affects our health
in so many ways beyond hearing.

00:02:29.051 --> 00:02:35.163
However, it's becoming increasingly
difficult to find quiet spaces

00:02:35.187 --> 00:02:38.824
in times of constantly increasing traffic,

00:02:38.848 --> 00:02:40.594
growing urbanization,

00:02:40.618 --> 00:02:43.163
construction sites,
air-conditioning units,

00:02:43.187 --> 00:02:45.155
leaf blowers, lawnmowers,

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:48.178
outdoor concerts and bars,
personal music players,

00:02:48.202 --> 00:02:50.928
and your neighbors partying until 3am.

00:02:50.952 --> 00:02:52.598
Whew!

00:02:52.622 --> 00:02:56.439
In 2011, the World Health
Organization estimated

00:02:56.463 --> 00:03:02.347
that 1.6 million healthy life years
are lost every year

00:03:02.371 --> 00:03:04.920
due to exposure to environmental noise

00:03:04.944 --> 00:03:07.483
in the Western European
member states alone.

00:03:09.086 --> 00:03:12.653
One important effect of noise
is that it disturbs communication.

00:03:13.053 --> 00:03:15.850
You may have to raise your voice
to be understood.

00:03:15.874 --> 00:03:19.348
In extreme cases, you may even
have to pause the conversation.

00:03:19.756 --> 00:03:23.633
It's also more likely to be misunderstood
in a noisy environment.

00:03:23.657 --> 00:03:26.994
These are all likely reasons
why studies have found

00:03:27.018 --> 00:03:30.496
that children who attend
schools in noisy areas

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.452
are more likely to lag behind their peers
in academic performance.

00:03:35.821 --> 00:03:38.312
Another very important
health effect of noise

00:03:38.336 --> 00:03:41.325
is the increased risk
for cardiovascular disease

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.648
in those who are exposed
to relevant noise levels

00:03:44.672 --> 00:03:46.803
for prolonged periods of time.

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:48.861
Noise is stress,

00:03:48.885 --> 00:03:51.956
especially if we have little
or no control over it.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.919
Our body excretes stress hormones
like adrenaline and cortisol

00:03:55.943 --> 00:03:58.831
that lead to changes
in the composition of our blood

00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:01.151
and in the structure of our blood vessels,

00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:05.380
which have been shown to be stiffer
after a single night of noise exposure.

00:04:06.103 --> 00:04:10.330
Epidemiological studies show associations
between the noise exposure

00:04:10.354 --> 00:04:13.799
and an increased risk
for high blood pressure,

00:04:13.823 --> 00:04:15.844
heart attacks and stroke,

00:04:15.868 --> 00:04:19.475
and although the overall risk increases
are relatively small,

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:22.889
this still constitutes
a major public health problem

00:04:22.913 --> 00:04:25.177
because noise is so ubiquitous,

00:04:25.201 --> 00:04:28.306
and so many people are exposed
to relevant noise levels.

00:04:29.376 --> 00:04:32.382
A recent study found that US society

00:04:32.406 --> 00:04:36.922
could save 3.9 billion dollars each year

00:04:36.946 --> 00:04:40.891
by lowering environmental
noise exposure by five decibels,

00:04:40.915 --> 00:04:44.428
just by saving costs for treating
cardiovascular disease.

00:04:45.184 --> 00:04:48.737
There are other diseases
like cancer, diabetes and obesity

00:04:48.761 --> 00:04:51.092
that have been linked to noise exposure,

00:04:51.116 --> 00:04:53.283
but we do not have enough evidence yet

00:04:53.307 --> 00:04:57.832
to, in fact, conclude that these diseases
are caused by the noise.

00:04:59.062 --> 00:05:02.553
Yet another important effect of noise
is sleep disturbance.

00:05:02.577 --> 00:05:05.615
Sleep is a very active mechanism
that recuperates us

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.052
and prepares us for the next wake period.

00:05:08.555 --> 00:05:12.698
A quiet bedroom is a cornerstone
of what sleep researchers call

00:05:12.722 --> 00:05:14.426
"a good sleep hygiene."

00:05:14.968 --> 00:05:17.908
And our auditory system
has a watchman function.

00:05:17.932 --> 00:05:21.122
It's constantly monitoring
our environment for threats,

00:05:21.146 --> 00:05:22.712
even while we're sleeping.

00:05:23.394 --> 00:05:28.708
So noise in the bedroom can cause a delay
in the time it takes us to fall asleep,

00:05:28.732 --> 00:05:31.154
it can wake us up during the night,

00:05:31.178 --> 00:05:34.893
and it can prevent our blood pressure
from going down during the night.

00:05:35.266 --> 00:05:38.655
We have the hypothesis that
if these noise-induced sleep disturbances

00:05:38.679 --> 00:05:40.689
continue for months and years,

00:05:40.713 --> 00:05:45.310
then an increased risk for cardiovascular
disease is likely the consequence.

00:05:46.107 --> 00:05:50.146
However, we are often not aware
of these noise-induced sleep disturbances,

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.709
because we are unconscious
while we're sleeping.

00:05:53.137 --> 00:05:57.016
In the past, we've done studies
on the effects of traffic noise on sleep,

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.139
and research subjects would often
wake up in the morning and say,

00:06:00.163 --> 00:06:02.760
"Ah, I had a wonderful night,
I fell asleep right away,

00:06:02.784 --> 00:06:04.517
never really woke up."

00:06:04.541 --> 00:06:07.344
When we would go back
to the physiological signals

00:06:07.368 --> 00:06:09.290
we had recorded during the night,

00:06:09.314 --> 00:06:11.623
we would often see numerous awakenings

00:06:11.647 --> 00:06:14.693
and a severely fragmented sleep structure.

00:06:14.717 --> 00:06:20.230
These awakenings were too brief
for the subjects to regain consciousness

00:06:20.254 --> 00:06:23.145
and to remember them
during the next morning,

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.253
but they may nevertheless
have a profound impact

00:06:26.277 --> 00:06:28.464
on how restful our sleep is.

00:06:30.273 --> 00:06:32.186
So when is loud too loud?

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.758
A good sign of too loud is
once you start changing your behavior.

00:06:37.752 --> 00:06:40.153
You may have to raise your voice
to be understood,

00:06:40.177 --> 00:06:42.405
or you increase the volume of your TV.

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:45.879
You're avoiding outside areas,
or you're closing your window.

00:06:46.356 --> 00:06:49.012
You're moving your bedroom
to the basement of the house,

00:06:49.036 --> 00:06:51.568
or you even have
sound insulation installed.

00:06:51.592 --> 00:06:55.014
Many people will move away
to less noisy areas,

00:06:55.038 --> 00:06:57.524
but obviously not everybody
can afford that.

00:06:59.508 --> 00:07:03.553
So what can we do right now
to improve our sound environment

00:07:03.577 --> 00:07:05.676
and to better protect our health?

00:07:06.473 --> 00:07:10.103
Well, first of all,
if something's too loud, speak up.

00:07:10.643 --> 00:07:13.312
For example, many owners of movie theaters

00:07:13.336 --> 00:07:17.761
seem to think that only people hard
of hearing are still going to the movies.

00:07:18.296 --> 00:07:21.004
If you complain about the noise
and nothing happens,

00:07:21.028 --> 00:07:23.114
demand a refund and leave.

00:07:23.138 --> 00:07:26.348
That's the language that managers
typically do understand.

00:07:27.329 --> 00:07:30.360
Also, talk to your children
about the health effects of noise

00:07:30.384 --> 00:07:34.885
and that listening to loud music today
will have consequences when they're older.

00:07:35.461 --> 00:07:38.454
You can also move your bedroom
to the quiet side of the house,

00:07:38.478 --> 00:07:41.486
where your own building shields you
from road traffic noise.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.652
If you're looking to rent
or buy a new place,

00:07:44.676 --> 00:07:46.529
make low noise a priority.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.848
Visit the property during
different times of the day

00:07:49.872 --> 00:07:51.939
and talk to the neighbors about noise.

00:07:53.048 --> 00:07:57.120
You can wear noise-canceling headphones
when you're traveling

00:07:57.144 --> 00:08:00.295
or if your office has high
background noise levels.

00:08:01.157 --> 00:08:03.689
In general, seek out quiet spaces,

00:08:03.713 --> 00:08:07.233
especially on the weekend
or when you're on vacation.

00:08:07.257 --> 00:08:09.995
Allow your system to wind down.

00:08:10.503 --> 00:08:12.870
I, very appropriately for this talk,

00:08:12.894 --> 00:08:15.979
attended a noise conference
in Japan four years ago.

00:08:16.383 --> 00:08:20.064
When I returned to the United States
and entered the airport,

00:08:20.088 --> 00:08:22.109
a wall of sound hit me.

00:08:22.547 --> 00:08:24.651
This tells you that
we don't realize anymore

00:08:24.675 --> 00:08:27.457
the constant degree
of noise pollution we're exposed to

00:08:27.481 --> 00:08:31.108
and how much we could profit
from more quiet spaces.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.451
What else can we do about noise?

00:08:34.975 --> 00:08:38.971
Well, very much like a carbon footprint,
we all have a noise footprint,

00:08:38.995 --> 00:08:42.346
and there are things we can do
to make that noise footprint smaller.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:48.223
For example, don't start mowing your lawn
at 7am on a Saturday morning.

00:08:48.247 --> 00:08:50.223
Your neighbors will thank you.

00:08:50.247 --> 00:08:52.927
Or use a rake instead of a leaf blower.

00:08:52.951 --> 00:08:57.189
In general, noise reduction at the source
makes the most sense,

00:08:57.213 --> 00:08:59.832
so whenever you're looking
to buy a new car,

00:08:59.856 --> 00:09:02.594
air-conditioning unit,
blender, you name it,

00:09:02.618 --> 00:09:04.372
make low noise a priority.

00:09:04.889 --> 00:09:08.625
Many manufacturers will list
the noise levels their devices generate,

00:09:08.649 --> 00:09:10.616
and some even advertise with them.

00:09:11.021 --> 00:09:12.528
Use that information.

00:09:14.014 --> 00:09:17.985
Many people think that stronger noise
regulation and enforcement are good ideas,

00:09:18.009 --> 00:09:20.134
even obvious solutions, perhaps,

00:09:20.158 --> 00:09:22.210
but it's not as easy as you may think,

00:09:22.234 --> 00:09:25.073
because many of the activities
that generate noise

00:09:25.097 --> 00:09:26.759
also generate revenue.

00:09:27.274 --> 00:09:32.229
Think about an airport and all
the business that is associated with it.

00:09:32.801 --> 00:09:36.423
Our research tells politicians
at what noise level

00:09:36.447 --> 00:09:38.612
they can expect a certain health effect,

00:09:38.636 --> 00:09:41.210
and that helps inform better noise policy.

00:09:42.568 --> 00:09:44.957
Robert Koch supposedly once said,

00:09:44.981 --> 00:09:49.851
"One day, mankind will fight noise
as relentlessly as cholera and the pest."

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:52.582
I think we're there,

00:09:52.606 --> 00:09:54.957
and I hope that we will win this fight,

00:09:54.981 --> 00:09:59.207
and when we do, we can all have
a nice, quiet celebration.

00:09:59.231 --> 00:10:00.318
(Laughter)

00:10:00.342 --> 00:10:01.515
Thank you.

00:10:01.539 --> 00:10:03.736
(Applause)
