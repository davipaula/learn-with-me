00:00:12.517 --> 00:00:15.140
Bryn Freedman: So you keep
talking about leadership

00:00:15.164 --> 00:00:17.617
as a real crisis of conformity.

00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:19.973
Can you explain to us
what you mean by that?

00:00:19.997 --> 00:00:22.351
What do you see as a crisis of conformity?

00:00:22.375 --> 00:00:24.934
Halla Tómasdóttir:
I think it's a crisis of conformity

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:28.522
when we continue to do business
and lead in the way we always have,

00:00:28.546 --> 00:00:31.263
yet the evidence is overwhelming

00:00:31.287 --> 00:00:33.769
that the world needs us
to change our ways.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.468
So let's look a little bit
at that evidence.

00:00:37.124 --> 00:00:40.375
Science has told us
that we're facing a climate crisis,

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.495
yet 40 percent of board directors

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:44.954
don't think climate belongs
in the boardroom.

00:00:45.704 --> 00:00:48.284
And we have kids marching
in the streets now,

00:00:48.308 --> 00:00:51.333
asking us to be accountable
for their future.

00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:53.982
We have a crisis of inequality.

00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:56.713
We have Yellow Jackets
not just in the streets of France,

00:00:56.737 --> 00:00:58.180
but all over the world,

00:00:58.204 --> 00:01:00.363
and yet we continue to see examples

00:01:00.387 --> 00:01:04.433
of businesses and other leaders
fueling that anger.

00:01:04.923 --> 00:01:06.968
BF: Do you think
the pitchforks are coming?

00:01:06.992 --> 00:01:09.258
HT: I definitely think
this is not sustainable.

00:01:09.282 --> 00:01:11.527
And the reason why it's so difficult

00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:15.898
for us to deal with these complicated
crises that are interrelated

00:01:15.922 --> 00:01:19.099
is that we are at the lowest levels
of trust we've ever been at.

00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:22.294
In the UK, three percent of people
trust their government

00:01:22.318 --> 00:01:23.975
to solve the Brexit crisis,

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:25.366
and that was in December.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.676
I think it's probably gone
down since then.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.992
BF: What do you think
new leadership actually looks like?

00:01:31.016 --> 00:01:33.026
HT: We need courageous leaders,

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.717
yet they have to be humble.

00:01:34.741 --> 00:01:37.861
And they have to be guided
by a moral compass,

00:01:37.885 --> 00:01:41.629
and the moral compass is the combination
of having a social purpose --

00:01:41.653 --> 00:01:44.304
you can't have your license
to operate anymore

00:01:44.328 --> 00:01:47.295
without a purpose
that contributes to society,

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:51.667
but what, to me, has been missing
from that dialogue is a set of principles.

00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:54.150
We cannot just define why we exist,

00:01:54.174 --> 00:01:57.142
we have to define
how we're going to do business

00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:58.500
and how we're going to lead.

00:01:58.524 --> 00:02:02.419
And to us, that has to be
to solve these imminent crises:

00:02:02.443 --> 00:02:03.673
the climate crisis,

00:02:03.697 --> 00:02:04.978
the crisis of inequality

00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:06.374
and the crisis of trust.

00:02:06.398 --> 00:02:07.567
So at The B Team,

00:02:07.591 --> 00:02:12.314
we embrace sustainability, equality
and accountability as our principles.

00:02:12.338 --> 00:02:17.703
BF: Do you think this whole question
of purpose is really window dressing --

00:02:17.727 --> 00:02:20.248
they're saying what they think
people want to hear,

00:02:20.272 --> 00:02:22.958
but they're actually not making
the fundamental changes

00:02:22.982 --> 00:02:24.133
that are necessary?

00:02:24.157 --> 00:02:25.955
HT: A lot of people feel that way,

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.403
and I think there's a growing
momentum behind that.

00:02:28.427 --> 00:02:31.384
So I think the world is calling
for responsible leadership now,

00:02:31.408 --> 00:02:34.449
and any leader who wants
to be around for the 21st century

00:02:34.473 --> 00:02:37.479
really needs to start thinking
courageously and holistically

00:02:37.503 --> 00:02:39.552
how they're going
to be part of the solution

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:41.033
and not window-dress anymore.

00:02:41.057 --> 00:02:42.542
You have to do it for real now.

00:02:42.566 --> 00:02:45.239
BF: Do you see anybody
out there who's doing it

00:02:45.263 --> 00:02:48.014
in a way that you think
is actually effective

00:02:48.038 --> 00:02:50.491
and has a real, long-term impact?

00:02:50.883 --> 00:02:53.407
HT: Fortunately, we have
some great leaders out there.

00:02:53.431 --> 00:02:54.830
And just to give one example,

00:02:54.854 --> 00:02:57.813
Emmanuel Faber, who's one of the newest
members of The B Team,

00:02:57.837 --> 00:02:59.042
he's the CEO of Danone,

00:02:59.066 --> 00:03:01.854
the world's largest yogurt-maker
and major food company --

00:03:01.878 --> 00:03:03.320
a real global company.

00:03:03.344 --> 00:03:05.185
He's so committed to sustainability

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.080
that he's not only changing the ways
of his own business,

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:10.020
but his entire supply chain.

00:03:10.044 --> 00:03:13.044
He's so committed to equality
that when he took on as CEO

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:14.846
and he said gender balance matters,

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.696
he created a gender-balanced
executive team

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.418
and gave men and women
equal maternity and paternity leave.

00:03:21.883 --> 00:03:23.707
He's so committed to accountability

00:03:23.731 --> 00:03:27.431
that he turned his US operations
into a B Corporation.

00:03:27.455 --> 00:03:29.512
Now many of you may not know what that is,

00:03:29.536 --> 00:03:31.930
but that's a company
that holds itself responsible

00:03:31.954 --> 00:03:35.383
for not just profit but its impact
on people and the planet,

00:03:35.407 --> 00:03:38.835
and transparently reports
on their performance on all of that.

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.891
It's the largest B Corp in the world.

00:03:40.915 --> 00:03:43.395
So to me, that's holistic,
courageous leadership,

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.332
and it's really the vision
we all need to hold.

00:03:46.356 --> 00:03:47.929
BF: Is this "Back to the Future"?

00:03:47.953 --> 00:03:50.803
I mean, I wonder,
when I think about companies --

00:03:50.827 --> 00:03:53.793
Anheuser-Busch comes to mind in America --

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:56.714
a 100-year-old company
that invested in its community,

00:03:56.738 --> 00:03:57.971
that gave a living wage

00:03:57.995 --> 00:04:00.715
before it ended up, you know,
losing and getting sold.

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.601
Are we really looking now for companies
that are global and community citizens,

00:04:05.625 --> 00:04:09.280
or is that something that is not
even useful anymore?

00:04:09.304 --> 00:04:13.493
HT: Well, you can do this for the reason
that it's risky, actually,

00:04:13.517 --> 00:04:15.675
to continue without doing
the right thing now.

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:17.381
You can't attract the right talent,

00:04:17.405 --> 00:04:18.707
you can't attract customers

00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:21.303
and increasingly,
you won't be able to attract capital.

00:04:21.327 --> 00:04:22.913
You might do it for risk reasons,

00:04:22.937 --> 00:04:25.496
you might do it for business
opportunity reasons,

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.536
because this is where the growth is,

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.036
which is why many leaders
are doing the right thing.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.842
But at the end of the day,

00:04:31.866 --> 00:04:33.208
we need to ask ourselves:

00:04:33.232 --> 00:04:36.012
"Who are we holding
ourselves accountable for?"

00:04:36.036 --> 00:04:37.871
And if that isn't the next generation,

00:04:37.895 --> 00:04:39.323
I don't know who.

00:04:39.347 --> 00:04:41.299
So I want to just make very clear,

00:04:41.323 --> 00:04:43.354
because we tend to think about leadership

00:04:43.378 --> 00:04:46.432
as only those who sit
in positions of power.

00:04:46.456 --> 00:04:48.814
To me, leadership is not at all like that.

00:04:48.838 --> 00:04:51.572
There's a leader inside
every single one of us,

00:04:51.596 --> 00:04:55.103
and our most important work in life
is to release that leader.

00:04:55.127 --> 00:04:57.962
And I think one of the greatest
global examples we have

00:04:57.986 --> 00:05:00.508
of someone who didn't --

00:05:00.532 --> 00:05:01.971
no one gave her power --

00:05:01.995 --> 00:05:04.649
is the 16-year-old girl
called Greta Thunberg.

00:05:04.673 --> 00:05:05.835
She's from Sweden,

00:05:05.859 --> 00:05:08.231
and a few years ago, she really became --

00:05:08.255 --> 00:05:09.462
she has Asperger's,

00:05:09.486 --> 00:05:12.007
and she became passionate
about our climate crisis --

00:05:12.031 --> 00:05:13.365
learned everything about it.

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:14.743
And faced with the evidence,

00:05:14.767 --> 00:05:17.395
she just felt so disappointed
in her leadership

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.091
that she started striking
in front of the Swedish parliament.

00:05:21.115 --> 00:05:23.134
And now she has started a global movement,

00:05:23.158 --> 00:05:26.216
and hundreds and thousands
of school kids are out in the streets

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.232
asking us to hold ourselves
accountable for their future.

00:05:29.592 --> 00:05:32.120
No one gave her that authority,

00:05:32.144 --> 00:05:35.684
and she now speaks to the leaders
of the world, heads of state,

00:05:35.708 --> 00:05:37.667
and really is impacting the world.

00:05:37.691 --> 00:05:41.751
So I really think that when we think
about leadership today,

00:05:41.775 --> 00:05:44.156
it can't be defined
to those in positions of power

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.836
though they have disproportionately
greater responsibility.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.673
But all of us need to think about,

00:05:49.697 --> 00:05:50.848
"What am I doing?"

00:05:50.872 --> 00:05:52.039
"How am I contributing?"

00:05:52.063 --> 00:05:54.075
And we need to release that leader inside

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:56.371
and actually start making
the positive impact

00:05:56.395 --> 00:05:58.182
this world is calling for right now.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.108
BF: But we have such
hierarchical leadership.

00:06:01.132 --> 00:06:03.164
I mean, I understand what you're saying --

00:06:03.188 --> 00:06:05.195
it's nice to release the leader inside --

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:07.171
but in these corporations,

00:06:07.195 --> 00:06:09.800
the truth is, it's extremely hierarchical.

00:06:09.824 --> 00:06:11.675
What can companies do

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:16.431
to create less vertical
and more horizontal relationships?

00:06:16.455 --> 00:06:19.170
HT: Well, I'm a big believer
and I've long been passionate

00:06:19.194 --> 00:06:20.594
about closing the gender gap,

00:06:20.618 --> 00:06:24.379
and I really believe gender-balanced
leadership is the way to go

00:06:24.403 --> 00:06:29.582
in order to embrace a leadership style
that has been shown to be more powerful,

00:06:29.606 --> 00:06:31.892
and that's when both men and women embrace

00:06:31.916 --> 00:06:33.766
both masculine and feminine values.

00:06:34.084 --> 00:06:35.762
It actually is proven in research

00:06:35.786 --> 00:06:38.988
that that's the most
effective leadership style.

00:06:39.012 --> 00:06:43.487
But I'm increasingly now thinking
about how we close the generational gap,

00:06:43.511 --> 00:06:46.875
because look at these young children
in the streets around the world --

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:48.197
they're asking us to lead.

00:06:48.221 --> 00:06:51.837
Kofi Annan used to say,
"You're never too young to lead."

00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:53.065
And then he would add,

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:54.958
"Or too old to learn."

00:06:54.982 --> 00:06:57.089
And I think we have now entered this era

00:06:57.113 --> 00:07:01.106
where we need the wisdom
of those with experience,

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.800
but we need the digital natives
of the young generation

00:07:04.824 --> 00:07:08.480
to co-mentor or to mentor us
just as much as we can help

00:07:08.504 --> 00:07:11.054
with wisdom from the older people.

00:07:11.078 --> 00:07:12.563
So it's a new reality,

00:07:12.587 --> 00:07:15.911
and these old, sort of hierarchical
ways to think about things,

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:18.954
they're increasingly coming
under pressure in this reality.

00:07:18.978 --> 00:07:21.621
BF: And you've actually called
that the hubris syndrome.

00:07:21.645 --> 00:07:22.887
Can you talk about that?

00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:26.979
HT: Well, yes, I think hubris
is our cancer in leadership.

00:07:27.003 --> 00:07:29.605
That's when leaders
think they know it all,

00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:31.604
can do it all, have all the answers

00:07:31.628 --> 00:07:33.867
and don't think they need
to surround themselves

00:07:33.891 --> 00:07:35.765
with people who will make them better,

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:38.885
which to me would, in some cases,
be more women and younger people

00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:42.225
and people who are diverse
and have different opinions in general.

00:07:42.249 --> 00:07:46.173
Hubris syndrome is so present
in leadership still,

00:07:46.197 --> 00:07:47.818
and we know many examples of them,

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:50.854
I don't need to name them.
And the problem with that --

00:07:50.878 --> 00:07:51.879
(Laughter)

00:07:51.903 --> 00:07:54.236
Yeah, we know them -- all over the world,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.773
not just in this country.

00:07:55.797 --> 00:07:59.840
But that kind of leadership
doesn't unleash leaders in others.

00:08:00.315 --> 00:08:02.070
No one person,

00:08:02.094 --> 00:08:06.601
or no one sector even has the solutions
we now need to come up with --

00:08:06.625 --> 00:08:09.813
the creativity and collaboration we need.

00:08:10.542 --> 00:08:14.510
The bold and the brave leadership
we need to come up with solutions

00:08:14.534 --> 00:08:19.381
that cross government, private sector,
civil society, young people, older people,

00:08:19.405 --> 00:08:23.009
people of all different backgrounds
coming together is the way

00:08:23.033 --> 00:08:25.126
to solve the issues
that are in front of us.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:29.643
BF: Do you see that kind of leadership
coming from the bottom-up

00:08:29.667 --> 00:08:30.891
or the top-down,

00:08:30.915 --> 00:08:33.600
or do you think a crisis
is going to force us

00:08:33.624 --> 00:08:35.974
into a reexamination of all of this?

00:08:35.998 --> 00:08:39.523
HT: Well, as someone who lived through
the most infamous financial meltdown

00:08:39.547 --> 00:08:40.882
in my home country, Iceland,

00:08:40.906 --> 00:08:43.721
I hope we don't need another one
to learn or to wake up.

00:08:44.126 --> 00:08:47.538
But I do see that we can't choose
one or the other.

00:08:47.875 --> 00:08:52.146
We do have to transform the way we lead --

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:54.384
from the top, the boardroom, the CEOs --

00:08:54.408 --> 00:08:56.146
we really do have to transform that,

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.429
but increasingly, we will transform that,

00:08:58.453 --> 00:09:01.435
because we have these social
movements coming from the bottom

00:09:01.459 --> 00:09:02.902
and throughout society.

00:09:03.224 --> 00:09:05.004
And the solutions exist.

00:09:05.622 --> 00:09:08.036
The only thing that's missing is will.

00:09:08.928 --> 00:09:14.866
So if we just all find a way to embrace
a moral compass of our own

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:19.481
to figure out why we exist
and how we're going to lead,

00:09:19.505 --> 00:09:23.439
and if we embrace courage
and humility in equal amounts,

00:09:23.463 --> 00:09:28.111
each one of us can be part
of this 10-year period

00:09:28.135 --> 00:09:31.410
where we can dramatically transform
the world we live in,

00:09:31.434 --> 00:09:32.915
and make it just,

00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:36.323
and make it about humanity
and not just the financial markets.

00:09:36.347 --> 00:09:39.924
BF: Well, we have a lot of people here
who I bet have questions for you,

00:09:39.948 --> 00:09:41.854
and we have a few minutes for questions,

00:09:41.878 --> 00:09:46.157
so is there anybody that would like
to ask Halla a question?

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.569
Audience: Hello, my name is Cheryl.

00:09:48.593 --> 00:09:50.293
I'm an aspiring leader,

00:09:50.317 --> 00:09:56.706
and I have a question about how you lead
when you have no influence.

00:09:57.029 --> 00:09:59.143
If I'm just an analyst,

00:09:59.167 --> 00:10:01.362
and I want to speak to senior management

00:10:01.386 --> 00:10:04.328
about a change that I feel
will affect the whole company,

00:10:04.352 --> 00:10:06.744
how do I go about changing their minds

00:10:06.768 --> 00:10:10.627
when they feel as if they've had
relationships that are set,

00:10:10.651 --> 00:10:13.865
that their way of business is set?

00:10:13.889 --> 00:10:16.387
How do you change minds
when you have no influence?

00:10:16.411 --> 00:10:19.148
HT: Well, thank you very much
for that fantastic question.

00:10:19.172 --> 00:10:21.956
So sometimes people
at the top won't listen,

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:25.967
but it's interesting that with the low
trust we have in society right now,

00:10:25.991 --> 00:10:27.854
the greatest trust we have

00:10:27.878 --> 00:10:31.167
is actually between the employee
and the employer,

00:10:31.191 --> 00:10:32.830
according to recent research.

00:10:32.854 --> 00:10:36.906
So I think that relationship
may be the most powerful way

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.229
to actually transform
the way we do things.

00:10:39.253 --> 00:10:43.506
So I would start by trying to build
a coalition for your good idea.

00:10:43.897 --> 00:10:49.631
And I don't know a single leader today
who will not listen to a concern

00:10:49.655 --> 00:10:51.340
that many of their employees hold.

00:10:51.738 --> 00:10:54.435
I'll give you an example
from another B Team leader,

00:10:54.459 --> 00:10:56.198
Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce.

00:10:56.222 --> 00:10:59.538
He's really been outspoken
on homelessness in San Francisco,

00:10:59.562 --> 00:11:03.714
on LGBTQI rights,

00:11:03.738 --> 00:11:06.671
and all of the things
that he's been standing up for,

00:11:06.695 --> 00:11:09.793
he does because his employees
care about them.

00:11:09.817 --> 00:11:14.043
So don't ever think you don't have power
if you don't sit in a position of power.

00:11:14.067 --> 00:11:16.531
Find the way to go convince him ...

00:11:16.555 --> 00:11:17.721
or her.

00:11:17.745 --> 00:11:22.360
And Marc, for example, was convinced
to close the gender pay gap by two women

00:11:22.384 --> 00:11:24.310
who worked inside of his organization,

00:11:24.334 --> 00:11:26.782
who told him, "We have a gender pay gap."

00:11:26.806 --> 00:11:29.213
He didn't believe it;
he said, "Bring me the data."

00:11:29.237 --> 00:11:32.936
They did, and he was smart enough to know
he needed to do something about it,

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.233
and was one the first tech leaders
to step up and do so voluntarily.

00:11:36.656 --> 00:11:39.046
So don't ever think
that you don't have power,

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.512
even if you don't sit
in a position of power,

00:11:41.536 --> 00:11:44.351
but find other people to support you

00:11:44.375 --> 00:11:46.952
and make the case.

00:11:47.965 --> 00:11:49.115
BF: Thank you.

00:11:49.139 --> 00:11:50.827
Anybody else? Any other questions?

00:11:50.851 --> 00:11:52.623
Audience: Hi, I'm overwhelmed
by fascination

00:11:52.647 --> 00:11:55.226
with everything you're saying,
so thank you.

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:59.665
I just wanted to ask how, like,
diversity in opinion and thought

00:11:59.689 --> 00:12:01.023
and also background

00:12:01.047 --> 00:12:03.350
has impacted your leadership ability.

00:12:03.374 --> 00:12:08.365
And what do you think is the barricade
that is limiting the overflow of diversity

00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:10.036
in all business settings,

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.937
and what do you think can impact
the change in that setting

00:12:13.961 --> 00:12:19.742
but also to disrupt the overflow
of generations of people staying in place?

00:12:19.766 --> 00:12:24.824
And what do you think is the next step
to breaking several glass ceilings?

00:12:24.848 --> 00:12:27.752
BF: We're going to do an entire Salon
just on that question.

00:12:27.776 --> 00:12:28.887
(Laughter)

00:12:28.911 --> 00:12:31.877
HT: I think Bryn said it well,
but let me try and touch on it.

00:12:31.901 --> 00:12:36.562
So the way I see gender,
it is a spectrum --

00:12:36.586 --> 00:12:38.115
you know, men also have gender.

00:12:38.139 --> 00:12:40.542
We sometimes forget about that.

00:12:40.566 --> 00:12:41.567
(Laughter)

00:12:41.591 --> 00:12:43.069
We sometimes forget about that.

00:12:43.093 --> 00:12:46.694
And I actually played a very masculine
woman early in my career,

00:12:46.718 --> 00:12:48.672
because those were the rules of the game.

00:12:48.696 --> 00:12:50.413
And I achieved some success with it,

00:12:50.437 --> 00:12:52.072
but fortunately, I got to a place

00:12:52.096 --> 00:12:54.564
where I started embracing
my feminine side as well.

00:12:54.588 --> 00:12:57.383
But I would still say
that the best leaders embrace both,

00:12:57.407 --> 00:12:58.812
both women and men.

00:12:58.836 --> 00:13:00.467
But I see gender, also,

00:13:00.491 --> 00:13:04.650
as one of the most powerful levers
to shift values in culture.

00:13:04.674 --> 00:13:07.449
So the reason I'm so passionate
about women in leadership

00:13:07.473 --> 00:13:10.941
and believe that balance is needed

00:13:10.965 --> 00:13:16.063
is because right now, our definition
of success is incredibly masculine.

00:13:16.526 --> 00:13:20.809
It's about financial profit alone
or economic growth alone,

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:23.188
and we all know that we need
more than money.

00:13:23.212 --> 00:13:25.519
I mean, we need wellness:

00:13:25.543 --> 00:13:27.018
well-being of people,

00:13:27.042 --> 00:13:31.219
and there is no future
beyond the well-being of our planet.

00:13:31.243 --> 00:13:35.096
So I think gender may very well be
one of the most powerful levers

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.725
to help all of us shift
our economic and social systems

00:13:38.749 --> 00:13:40.169
to be more welcoming.

00:13:40.193 --> 00:13:41.891
And the answer to your last part --

00:13:41.915 --> 00:13:45.082
it's so complicated, but let me try
to give you a short one.

00:13:45.526 --> 00:13:51.743
I believe that the way talent
and consumption is shifting

00:13:51.767 --> 00:13:54.508
is going to increasingly get companies

00:13:54.532 --> 00:13:58.338
to look at adding difference
into their leadership,

00:13:58.362 --> 00:14:00.834
because sameness is not working --

00:14:00.858 --> 00:14:02.569
BF: And difference is a superpower.

00:14:02.593 --> 00:14:04.071
HT: Difference is a superpower.

00:14:04.095 --> 00:14:05.324
BF: Thank you very much.

00:14:05.348 --> 00:14:08.263
Halla, thank you so much,
I wish we could talk to you all day.

00:14:08.287 --> 00:14:09.288
(Applause and cheers)

00:14:09.312 --> 00:14:10.463
HT: Thank you.

00:14:10.487 --> 00:14:11.864
(Applause)
