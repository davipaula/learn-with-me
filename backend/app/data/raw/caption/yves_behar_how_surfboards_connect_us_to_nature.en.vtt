00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:16.307
Riding a wave is like
suddenly gaining speed

00:00:16.331 --> 00:00:18.737
and gliding at the same time.

00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:21.577
Like walking on water, like flying.

00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:27.043
I think it's really about being one
with a natural phenomenon.

00:00:27.067 --> 00:00:29.567
[Small thing. Big idea.]

00:00:32.808 --> 00:00:35.427
The surfboard requires
a lot of ergonomic thinking.

00:00:35.451 --> 00:00:37.967
How do I stand on it?
How do I not slip off?

00:00:37.991 --> 00:00:39.157
But at the same time,

00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:41.467
it really has to work
in that fluid environment.

00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:45.007
It's really considered
for the rider in some areas

00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:47.396
and for water and physics in others.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.468
A surfboard is made out of a core element

00:00:49.492 --> 00:00:52.407
which tends to be foam,
which makes the board float,

00:00:52.431 --> 00:00:55.857
and the skin of the board
is some kind of resin,

00:00:55.881 --> 00:00:58.027
epoxy, sometimes fiberglass.

00:00:58.051 --> 00:00:59.900
There often is also a stringer,

00:00:59.924 --> 00:01:01.423
a wood piece down the middle,

00:01:01.447 --> 00:01:03.117
which makes it stronger.

00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:06.637
The rocker is the curvature
of the board in the front.

00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:09.427
That is important because that determines

00:01:09.451 --> 00:01:12.477
what kind of wave
you will be able to take,

00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:13.897
how steep the wave is.

00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:15.377
The tail affects performance.

00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:17.957
Different tails will make
the board react differently,

00:01:17.981 --> 00:01:20.477
so it's a lot about personal preference.

00:01:20.501 --> 00:01:21.931
Our understanding of surfing

00:01:21.955 --> 00:01:26.597
comes from when the Tahitians in 1200 AD
brought it to Hawaii.

00:01:26.621 --> 00:01:29.307
So when James Cook arrived around 1780,

00:01:29.331 --> 00:01:33.127
he was mesmerized
by hundreds of people in the water,

00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:36.367
children, women, men, surfing naked.

00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:38.137
Calvinist missionaries arrive

00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:40.367
and they're scandalized by it.

00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:42.937
It becomes an illegal activity.

00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:44.818
It becomes counterculture.

00:01:44.842 --> 00:01:48.547
The father of modern surfing
is a Hawaiian named Duke Kahanamoku.

00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:50.887
He is an extraordinary swimmer,

00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:53.587
wins gold at the Olympics in 1912.

00:01:53.611 --> 00:01:56.277
Goes around the world
to show his swimming

00:01:56.301 --> 00:01:59.457
but brings surfboards
and demonstrates surfing.

00:01:59.481 --> 00:02:01.747
Imagine, people had never
seen surfing before.

00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:04.521
Suddenly, some person from a faraway place

00:02:04.545 --> 00:02:06.857
is standing on water, riding on water.

00:02:06.881 --> 00:02:08.377
He comes back to Hawaii,

00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:10.577
and they start to make more boards.

00:02:10.601 --> 00:02:11.947
Pre-Second World War,

00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:14.727
you're still looking
at big, heavy wood boards.

00:02:14.751 --> 00:02:15.907
Post-Second World War,

00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:18.757
new materials and new technologies
become available,

00:02:18.781 --> 00:02:22.554
and those make the board
lighter, more accessible, cheaper,

00:02:22.578 --> 00:02:24.847
but it continues to be a custom object,

00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:27.337
something that is made
specifically for a person

00:02:27.361 --> 00:02:28.538
or for a certain spot.

00:02:28.562 --> 00:02:30.687
It's a very symbiotic relationship

00:02:30.711 --> 00:02:32.677
between surfer and shaper.

00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:34.507
There's so many different criteria

00:02:34.531 --> 00:02:37.837
that affect the physics
of how that surfboard

00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:39.877
is moving in water.

00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:42.867
A longboard is typically
used on smaller waves.

00:02:42.891 --> 00:02:44.727
The riding has a lot of style.

00:02:44.751 --> 00:02:46.217
You can walk the board,

00:02:46.241 --> 00:02:48.687
put your toes over it, do a hang ten.

00:02:48.711 --> 00:02:50.597
A shortboard will be faster.

00:02:50.621 --> 00:02:53.157
They're harder to ride,
they sink under the body.

00:02:53.181 --> 00:02:57.267
Board design comes at the intersection
between those physical factors,

00:02:57.291 --> 00:03:01.077
and really, how I want to put
myself in the water.

00:03:01.101 --> 00:03:05.317
It's an expression
as much as it is a physical activity.

00:03:05.341 --> 00:03:07.957
The draw may be
because water is so elusive.

00:03:07.981 --> 00:03:10.577
You can't fight it, you can't change it.

00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:14.047
The best I can do
is recognize what it does.

00:03:14.071 --> 00:03:16.767
The surf may be big and getting bigger

00:03:16.791 --> 00:03:18.677
and surging while you're in the water.

00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:19.940
The elements are changing.

00:03:19.964 --> 00:03:21.147
The wind is coming up.

00:03:21.171 --> 00:03:24.167
You have to be in symbiosis
with the environment.

00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:26.837
You need to look and feel for everything

00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:28.687
that's happening around you.

00:03:28.711 --> 00:03:30.287
And yet, it's so short.

00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:32.667
Five, eight, 15 seconds.

00:03:32.691 --> 00:03:35.377
It's fleeting,
but you have to go back to it.
