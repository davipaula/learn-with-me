00:00:00.083 --> 00:00:03.851
Many of us like to start the day
with a cup of coffee

00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:06.893
and perhaps end the day
with a glass of wine

00:00:06.917 --> 00:00:09.143
or some other kind of alcoholic drink.

00:00:09.167 --> 00:00:11.934
But it turns out
that these two substances,

00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:16.768
alcohol and caffeine,
can have surprising impacts on our sleep.

00:00:16.792 --> 00:00:19.331
[Sleeping with Science]

00:00:19.375 --> 00:00:21.809
(Music)

00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:24.101
Let's start with caffeine.

00:00:24.125 --> 00:00:26.309
Caffeine is in a class of drugs

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:29.684
that we call the psychoactive stimulants.

00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:33.101
And everyone knows that caffeine
can make them more alert.

00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:35.143
It can wake them up.

00:00:35.167 --> 00:00:37.434
But there are at least two additional,

00:00:37.458 --> 00:00:39.684
hidden features of caffeine

00:00:39.708 --> 00:00:42.434
that some people may not be aware of.

00:00:42.458 --> 00:00:47.059
The first is the duration
of action of caffeine.

00:00:47.083 --> 00:00:49.059
Caffeine, for the average adult,

00:00:49.083 --> 00:00:51.559
will have what we call a half-life

00:00:51.583 --> 00:00:53.851
of about five to six hours.

00:00:53.875 --> 00:00:57.351
What that means is that
after about five to six hours

00:00:57.375 --> 00:01:00.601
50 percent of that caffeine that you had

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:03.643
is still circulating in your system.

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:07.976
What that also means
is that caffeine has a quarter-life

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.976
of about 10 to 12 hours.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.018
In other words, let's say
that you have a cup of coffee

00:01:14.042 --> 00:01:16.393
at 2pm in the evening.

00:01:16.417 --> 00:01:20.143
It could be that almost
a quarter of that caffeine

00:01:20.167 --> 00:01:24.059
is still swilling around
in your brain at midnight.

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:27.643
And as a result, it can make
it harder for an individual

00:01:27.667 --> 00:01:31.184
to fall asleep or even stay asleep soundly

00:01:31.208 --> 00:01:32.684
throughout the night.

00:01:32.708 --> 00:01:35.434
So that's the first feature of caffeine.

00:01:35.458 --> 00:01:37.684
The second issue with caffeine

00:01:37.708 --> 00:01:41.351
is that it can change
the quality of your sleep.

00:01:41.375 --> 00:01:42.976
Now some people will tell me

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.809
that I'm one of those individuals

00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:47.309
who can have an espresso with dinner,

00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:50.559
and I fall asleep fine,
and I can stay asleep.

00:01:50.583 --> 00:01:53.059
But even if that's true, it turns out

00:01:53.083 --> 00:01:56.434
that caffeine can actually
decrease the amount

00:01:56.458 --> 00:01:59.893
of deep, non-rapid eye movement
sleep that we have,

00:01:59.917 --> 00:02:03.059
stages three and four of non-REM sleep.

00:02:03.083 --> 00:02:06.018
That's that sort of
restorative deep sleep.

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:09.393
And as a consequence,
you can wake up the next morning,

00:02:09.417 --> 00:02:11.101
and you don't feel refreshed,

00:02:11.125 --> 00:02:13.809
you don't feel restored by your sleep.

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:15.434
But you don't remember waking up,

00:02:15.458 --> 00:02:18.018
you don't remember
struggling to fall asleep,

00:02:18.042 --> 00:02:20.226
so you don't make the connection,

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.018
but nevertheless
you may then find yourself

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:26.726
reaching for two cups of coffee
in the morning to wake up

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.309
rather than one.

00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:33.143
So that's caffeine,
but now let's move on to alcohol,

00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:35.059
because alcohol is perhaps one

00:02:35.083 --> 00:02:39.143
of the most misunderstood
sleep aids out there.

00:02:39.167 --> 00:02:42.559
In fact, it's anything but a sleep aid.

00:02:42.583 --> 00:02:44.893
And it can be problematic for your sleep

00:02:44.917 --> 00:02:47.226
in at least three different ways.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.684
First, alcohol is in a class of drugs

00:02:49.708 --> 00:02:52.184
that we call the sedatives.

00:02:52.208 --> 00:02:55.059
But sedation is not sleep.

00:02:55.083 --> 00:02:57.309
And studies teach us that those two things

00:02:57.333 --> 00:02:59.309
are really quite different.

00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:00.934
Sedation is a case

00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:04.393
where we're simply
switching off the firing

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:07.809
of the brain cells,
particularly in the cortex.

00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:10.476
And that's not natural sleep.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.434
In fact, during deep
non-rapid eye movement sleep,

00:03:13.458 --> 00:03:17.976
for example, the brain has
this remarkable coordination

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.684
of hundreds of thousands of cells

00:03:20.708 --> 00:03:23.018
that all of a sudden fire together,

00:03:23.042 --> 00:03:24.476
and then they all go silent,

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.434
and then they all fire together,
and then they go silent,

00:03:27.458 --> 00:03:30.434
producing these big, powerful brainwaves

00:03:30.458 --> 00:03:32.768
of deep non-REM sleep.

00:03:32.792 --> 00:03:34.393
And so that's the first way

00:03:34.417 --> 00:03:36.809
in which alcohol can be problematic.

00:03:36.833 --> 00:03:40.268
We're mistaking sedation for deep sleep.

00:03:40.292 --> 00:03:42.518
The second problem with alcohol

00:03:42.542 --> 00:03:45.643
is that it can actually
fragment your sleep.

00:03:45.667 --> 00:03:49.643
Alcohol can actually trigger
and activate during sleep

00:03:49.667 --> 00:03:52.309
what we call the fight or flight branch

00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:53.893
of the nervous system,

00:03:53.917 --> 00:03:56.559
which will therefore
wake you up more frequently

00:03:56.583 --> 00:03:58.184
throughout the night.

00:03:58.208 --> 00:04:00.476
And alcohol can even increase the amount

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.184
of alerting chemicals
that are released by the brain,

00:04:04.208 --> 00:04:06.934
once again fragmenting your sleep.

00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:11.018
The third and final issue
with alcohol and sleep

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:13.393
is that alcohol can actually block

00:04:13.417 --> 00:04:16.768
your rapid eye movement sleep,
or your dream sleep.

00:04:16.792 --> 00:04:19.476
And as we'll learn in subsequent episodes,

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.393
REM sleep, or rapid eye
movement sleep, dream sleep,

00:04:22.417 --> 00:04:24.559
provides a collection of benefits,

00:04:24.583 --> 00:04:26.726
things such as your emotional

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.101
and mental health, even creativity.

00:04:30.125 --> 00:04:33.851
Now I'm not here
to tell anyone how to live.

00:04:33.875 --> 00:04:35.851
I don't want to be puritanical.

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:37.559
I'm just a scientist.

00:04:37.583 --> 00:04:40.393
What I want to try and do is provide you

00:04:40.417 --> 00:04:43.101
with the information
about the relationship

00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:46.226
between caffeine and alcohol on your sleep

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.309
so then you can make an informed choice

00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:52.059
as to how best you want to live your life

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:54.833
when you're trying to
prioritize your sleep health.
