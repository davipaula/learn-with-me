00:00:12.594 --> 00:00:14.000
OK.

00:00:14.024 --> 00:00:17.246
So we are going to start in 1891,

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.595
when a German scientist
was looking through a microscope

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.204
at insect cells.

00:00:22.228 --> 00:00:23.916
And he saw something kind of funny.

00:00:24.348 --> 00:00:28.109
At the center of the cells,
there was this dark stuff.

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.903
No one had ever seen it before.

00:00:29.927 --> 00:00:33.601
And he noticed that as the cells
would multiply and divide,

00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:36.045
it would go into some of the new cells

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:37.347
but not the others.

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:40.331
He didn't know what it was,
so he gave it a really great name.

00:00:40.355 --> 00:00:42.332
He called it the "X element."

00:00:42.356 --> 00:00:43.546
(Laughter)

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.198
And he was like,
"We'll just fill in that X later."

00:00:46.927 --> 00:00:50.070
And then, fast-forward 10 years later,

00:00:50.094 --> 00:00:52.093
and there is an American scientist,

00:00:52.117 --> 00:00:54.498
and she is looking through her microscope,

00:00:54.522 --> 00:00:56.355
also at insect cells.

00:00:56.887 --> 00:00:58.283
And she sees something funny.

00:00:58.307 --> 00:01:00.429
There's more of this dark stuff.

00:01:00.453 --> 00:01:01.609
And it's kind of tiny,

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:04.545
it's hanging out near the X element.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:06.141
And eventually, someone was like,

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:07.899
"Well, if that one thing's called X,

00:01:07.923 --> 00:01:10.121
should we call this other thing Y?"

00:01:10.145 --> 00:01:11.684
And like that, (Snaps fingers)

00:01:11.708 --> 00:01:13.739
the sex chromosomes had been discovered.

00:01:14.312 --> 00:01:15.970
So chromosomes,

00:01:15.994 --> 00:01:17.724
you probably all know what they are,

00:01:17.748 --> 00:01:19.098
but I will tell you anyways.

00:01:19.122 --> 00:01:20.609
They're made up of DNA --

00:01:20.633 --> 00:01:23.101
everything has it,
it's the blueprint of life,

00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:24.680
we've got rats, we've got trees,

00:01:24.704 --> 00:01:27.076
we've got insects, we've got humans.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.287
And in the case of human chromosomes,

00:01:30.311 --> 00:01:33.318
geneticist Melissa Wilson
broke it down for me like this.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.652
(Audio) Melissa Wilson: Typically,
you'll get one copy of every chromosome

00:01:37.676 --> 00:01:38.934
from your genetic mom

00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.597
and one copy of every chromosome
from your genetic dad,

00:01:41.621 --> 00:01:43.726
and we have 22 of these

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.243
that you get one copy from mom
and one copy from dad.

00:01:46.267 --> 00:01:49.702
And then there's a 23rd pair, X and Y.

00:01:50.345 --> 00:01:53.537
Molly Webster: So while all
the other chromosomes are numbered,

00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:55.354
one through 22,

00:01:55.378 --> 00:01:58.093
we do not call X and Y 23.

00:01:58.513 --> 00:02:02.180
I like to think that they are waiting
for, like, a LeBron James to come along.

00:02:02.204 --> 00:02:04.562
But in this instance, they were like,

00:02:04.586 --> 00:02:06.712
"We're just going to keep the letters,

00:02:06.736 --> 00:02:08.902
and then we'll give them a title."

00:02:08.926 --> 00:02:10.918
They called them the sex chromosomes.

00:02:10.942 --> 00:02:13.371
Now I would wager
that in the United States,

00:02:13.395 --> 00:02:16.053
these are the most well-known chromosomes

00:02:16.077 --> 00:02:17.648
for one simple fact:

00:02:17.672 --> 00:02:20.934
that we say X equals "girl,"
and Y equals "boy" --

00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.418
that they are responsible for sex.

00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:25.022
And -- and I had to learn this --

00:02:25.046 --> 00:02:27.506
but when I'm talking about "sex" here,

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.688
I'm talking about the way biology
gives us gonads,

00:02:30.712 --> 00:02:32.649
which are our ovaries and our testes --

00:02:32.673 --> 00:02:35.847
I'm not talking about gender,
which is how we identify.

00:02:35.871 --> 00:02:38.680
And so, as a reporter at the show --

00:02:38.704 --> 00:02:43.093
"Radiolab," the audio documentary
program I work for --

00:02:43.117 --> 00:02:46.537
I was like, what's up
with these sex chromosomes?

00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:49.300
You know, that's kind of my job,
I think things are weird,

00:02:49.324 --> 00:02:51.236
and then I get to call people about them

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.661
and ask questions,
and then hopefully they answer.

00:02:53.685 --> 00:02:55.685
And in this case,
a lot of people answered.

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.237
And in the two years I had
of reporting on X and Y,

00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:01.879
as part of "Gonads,"
the series on sex and gender

00:03:01.903 --> 00:03:03.863
I ended up doing for "Radiolab,"

00:03:03.887 --> 00:03:09.045
I found out that these two chromosomes
live in a world that is unexpected,

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.878
a little unsettling;

00:03:10.902 --> 00:03:12.758
where things that I thought were facts

00:03:12.782 --> 00:03:15.516
were, like, twisted in ways
I hadn't seen before.

00:03:15.878 --> 00:03:20.224
And the world goes so far
beyond the boundaries of sex,

00:03:20.248 --> 00:03:21.501
I was like,

00:03:21.525 --> 00:03:23.724
"Maybe we should all talk about this."

00:03:23.748 --> 00:03:25.867
So, you're you all,

00:03:25.891 --> 00:03:28.700
we're all going to talk about it.

00:03:28.724 --> 00:03:30.180
And for me,

00:03:30.204 --> 00:03:34.156
the true story of X and Y
starts with their name.

00:03:34.498 --> 00:03:37.045
So within years of being discovered,

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.069
these two little chromosomes
had acquired more than 10 different names.

00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:44.649
There was diplosome and heterochromosome

00:03:44.673 --> 00:03:46.093
and idiochromosome,

00:03:46.117 --> 00:03:49.768
and most of the names had to do
with their structure, their shape,

00:03:49.792 --> 00:03:51.172
their size.

00:03:51.196 --> 00:03:53.196
And then there was "sex chromosome,"

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.347
which they had been given
because of the fact

00:03:55.371 --> 00:03:58.403
that we had started seeing that the X
would go with the females,

00:03:58.427 --> 00:04:01.093
and the Y would often go with the males.

00:04:01.498 --> 00:04:03.918
But scientists were like,

00:04:03.942 --> 00:04:06.760
"Do we really want
to call them sex chromosomes?"

00:04:06.784 --> 00:04:11.011
And science historian Sarah Richardson
is the one who told me this story.

00:04:11.823 --> 00:04:14.967
(Audio) Sarah Richardson:
For three decades, scientists were like,

00:04:14.991 --> 00:04:17.180
"You should not call them
the sex chromosomes.

00:04:17.204 --> 00:04:19.760
The X and Y have many functions,

00:04:19.784 --> 00:04:23.847
and you wouldn't assume
that a single chromosome

00:04:23.871 --> 00:04:25.640
controls a single trait.

00:04:25.664 --> 00:04:29.905
Imagine calling one chromosome
the 'urogenital chromosome,'

00:04:29.929 --> 00:04:32.237
or the 'liver chromosome.'"

00:04:33.118 --> 00:04:35.523
MW: Scientists, if you dig 
into the history --

00:04:35.547 --> 00:04:37.055
it's really cool, you should --

00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:41.996
were hesitant to, like,
commit to such a specific name

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.599
and such a powerfully connotated name.

00:04:44.623 --> 00:04:47.481
There was a fear that it would
actually be really limiting --

00:04:47.505 --> 00:04:49.615
maybe to science, maybe to society --

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.572
but the fear was in the room.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.204
And you can see they ended up
getting "sex chromosome" --

00:04:56.228 --> 00:04:58.831
it's like a pretty juicy title,

00:04:58.855 --> 00:05:01.633
it popularized genetics, you know?

00:05:01.657 --> 00:05:06.812
But in the 100-year history
since we settled on that name,

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:10.382
you can see it starts
to get a little complicated.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.008
So around 1960 --

00:05:13.032 --> 00:05:15.208
this is going to be our first stop

00:05:15.232 --> 00:05:17.601
on the complicated world
of the sex chromosomes --

00:05:17.625 --> 00:05:19.255
so around 1960,

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:22.442
we had discovered that you could be XYY.

00:05:22.466 --> 00:05:24.703
They discovered an XYY man.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.903
And to digress a little here,

00:05:27.927 --> 00:05:32.593
it turns out that the model
of "X equals girl and Y equals boy"

00:05:32.617 --> 00:05:34.324
is really simplistic.

00:05:34.348 --> 00:05:38.776
You can actually be a whole bunch
of different combinations of X and Y,

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.219
giving you, like, different types
of biological sex.

00:05:42.243 --> 00:05:44.474
You could be two Xs and two Ys together.

00:05:44.498 --> 00:05:46.514
You could be four Xs,
you could be five Xs,

00:05:46.538 --> 00:05:47.847
you could be XO.

00:05:47.871 --> 00:05:50.458
And so I thought that was pretty crazy,

00:05:50.482 --> 00:05:51.665
because I was like,

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:54.023
"Wow, this really upends
a model of biological sex

00:05:54.047 --> 00:05:56.791
I think most of us in this room
have been taught."

00:05:56.815 --> 00:06:00.131
So a few years after they realized
that you can be XYY,

00:06:00.155 --> 00:06:02.766
researchers go to a prison in Scotland,

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.830
and they do genetic analysis
of a bunch of the male prisoners.

00:06:06.854 --> 00:06:10.139
And they find a number
of people who are XYY.

00:06:10.577 --> 00:06:12.111
And according to Sarah:

00:06:13.093 --> 00:06:15.871
(Audio) SR: They just rushed
to publish a theory

00:06:15.895 --> 00:06:19.425
suggesting that this extra Y chromosome

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:22.628
could explain criminality in some men.

00:06:23.774 --> 00:06:24.934
MW: Yeah.

00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.544
So the logic goes like this:

00:06:26.568 --> 00:06:29.219
By this point, we're thinking Y is male.

00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:31.902
We think male is aggressive,

00:06:31.926 --> 00:06:33.816
so Y must be aggression.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.696
If you've got an extra Y,
you must be crazy.

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:39.332
And like, we went nuts with this theory.

00:06:39.356 --> 00:06:41.665
We called it the supermale,

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:43.963
they started scanning more prisoners,

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:47.443
serial killers, boys.

00:06:47.467 --> 00:06:48.627
And in all seriousness,

00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:52.985
there was actually a suggestion
that we consider aborting XYY fetuses.

00:06:55.572 --> 00:06:57.056
So in 1980,

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.763
this theory pretty much toppled,
for a number of reasons.

00:07:00.787 --> 00:07:02.482
One,

00:07:02.506 --> 00:07:04.323
there had been this really large study

00:07:04.347 --> 00:07:06.474
that basically showed
there was no connection

00:07:06.498 --> 00:07:08.545
between Y and violence,

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:10.609
I think we all saw that coming.

00:07:10.633 --> 00:07:12.966
And then, there was one other thing.

00:07:13.799 --> 00:07:16.673
(Audio) SR: Going back
and looking at those original findings

00:07:16.697 --> 00:07:18.894
in that high-security
psychiatric institution,

00:07:18.918 --> 00:07:23.623
they had also found
a high number of individuals

00:07:23.647 --> 00:07:25.965
with an extra X chromosome.

00:07:25.989 --> 00:07:29.510
So these are XXY, as opposed to XYY.

00:07:29.534 --> 00:07:30.685
(Audio) MW: Really?

00:07:30.709 --> 00:07:32.664
(Audio) SR: Yeah. 
Now, they never claimed

00:07:32.674 --> 00:07:34.863
that the individuals
with an extra X chromosome

00:07:34.887 --> 00:07:36.154
were superfemales.

00:07:36.458 --> 00:07:40.839
They never investigated
whether they had higher rates of violence.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.068
MW: Seems like kind of an oversight.

00:07:43.092 --> 00:07:44.252
I don't know.

00:07:44.276 --> 00:07:46.476
But I think it's interesting,

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:51.109
because what you see is if you start
looking at these chromosomes

00:07:51.133 --> 00:07:52.442
through the lens of sex,

00:07:52.466 --> 00:07:54.619
what naturally falls in place behind

00:07:54.643 --> 00:07:57.172
is we look at them
through the lens of gender,

00:07:57.196 --> 00:07:59.315
and the traits
that we associate with gender.

00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:00.831
So men were violent,

00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:03.117
and Y explained why they were in prison.

00:08:03.141 --> 00:08:04.562
The X did not do that,

00:08:04.586 --> 00:08:06.458
because like, you know, what's X?

00:08:06.482 --> 00:08:08.768
We don't associate it with violence.

00:08:08.792 --> 00:08:12.125
And while we don't believe
in supermales today --

00:08:12.149 --> 00:08:13.323
God, I hope we don't --

00:08:13.347 --> 00:08:15.181
we don't believe in supermales today,

00:08:15.205 --> 00:08:18.545
there is a very similar conversation
that's still happening

00:08:18.569 --> 00:08:22.309
around inherent violence
in boys and biology.

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:27.640
So my next stop
on the weird world of X and Y,

00:08:27.664 --> 00:08:31.280
or things feeling
a little topsy-turvy, is 1985.

00:08:31.616 --> 00:08:35.291
The World University Games
were set to happen in Japan,

00:08:35.315 --> 00:08:41.532
and the Spanish hurdler María José
Martínez-Patiño was scheduled to run.

00:08:41.556 --> 00:08:44.127
She was like a hot shot,
a rising superstar.

00:08:45.112 --> 00:08:48.739
And the night before her race,
they had her DNA scanned.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.990
Now at the time, this was a thing
that they were doing,

00:08:52.014 --> 00:08:53.164
because they were like,

00:08:53.188 --> 00:08:57.093
"OK, we don't want men
covertly racing as women,

00:08:57.117 --> 00:08:59.720
so we're going to scan the women

00:08:59.744 --> 00:09:01.736
and make sure all their Xs line up."

00:09:03.165 --> 00:09:06.323
And so I heard this story
from Ruth Padawer

00:09:06.347 --> 00:09:08.776
who was a New York Times Magazine reporter

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.894
and she reported on María.

00:09:12.013 --> 00:09:15.910
(Audio) Ruth Padawer: So they tell her
the chromosome test results were abnormal.

00:09:15.934 --> 00:09:18.156
Although on the outside,
she was fully female,

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.793
she had XY chromosomes
and these internal testes.

00:09:22.236 --> 00:09:23.387
MW: They were like,

00:09:23.411 --> 00:09:26.395
"We hate to break it to you, María,
but you're actually a dude.

00:09:26.419 --> 00:09:28.552
You can't race with the ladies."

00:09:30.497 --> 00:09:33.029
(Audio) RP: And so she's thrown
off the national team,

00:09:33.053 --> 00:09:36.014
she's expelled from
the athletics residence,

00:09:36.038 --> 00:09:37.728
she's denied her scholarship,

00:09:37.752 --> 00:09:39.458
a bunch of her friends dump her,

00:09:39.482 --> 00:09:41.612
fellow athletes abandon her,

00:09:41.636 --> 00:09:44.863
she loses her medals,
her records are revoked.

00:09:46.784 --> 00:09:48.045
MW: So it turns out --

00:09:48.069 --> 00:09:49.260
remember when I told you

00:09:49.284 --> 00:09:52.001
you can be a bunch of different
combinations of X and Y --

00:09:52.025 --> 00:09:54.354
you can also be XY and be female.

00:09:54.378 --> 00:09:55.912
You can be XX and male.

00:09:56.577 --> 00:10:00.347
In María's case, she was something called
androgen insensitive.

00:10:00.371 --> 00:10:04.299
Which means that she did have
some sort of internal testes --

00:10:04.323 --> 00:10:06.490
they were making testosterone --

00:10:06.514 --> 00:10:08.728
but her body couldn't use it.

00:10:08.752 --> 00:10:11.887
And so if you thought of testosterone
as, like, a superpower,

00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:14.014
she was not benefiting from it.

00:10:14.038 --> 00:10:15.236
And so eventually,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.855
sports authorities, like, let her back in,

00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:19.479
but her career was done.

00:10:20.498 --> 00:10:23.323
And in this instance you see how,

00:10:24.283 --> 00:10:27.926
if you assign sex
to a specific place in the body,

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.450
or at least, like,
this is what I saw, right?

00:10:30.474 --> 00:10:34.093
If you assign sex
to a specific place in the body,

00:10:34.117 --> 00:10:37.410
it somehow makes us think
that we can go into a body,

00:10:37.434 --> 00:10:39.037
look at a specific place

00:10:39.061 --> 00:10:41.681
and tell someone we know
something more about them

00:10:41.705 --> 00:10:43.800
than they know about themselves.

00:10:44.188 --> 00:10:46.623
And that feels terrifying to me.

00:10:48.188 --> 00:10:51.878
And we don't genetically test
female athletes anymore,

00:10:51.902 --> 00:10:55.137
but you can see very similar
conversations happening

00:10:55.161 --> 00:10:57.680
when we talk about testosterone in sports,

00:10:57.704 --> 00:11:01.625
you can also see it in suggestions
that we take transgender individuals

00:11:01.649 --> 00:11:05.243
and we genetically analyze them
and we tell them who they are.

00:11:06.238 --> 00:11:07.436
That is real,

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.019
that is a conversation
that has happened recently.

00:11:11.944 --> 00:11:13.857
The last place that I'll share with you

00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:16.093
where these chromosomes
got complicated for me

00:11:16.117 --> 00:11:18.212
is this one thing that Melissa told me.

00:11:18.832 --> 00:11:21.591
(Audio) Wilson: You can't 
survive without an X chromosome.

00:11:21.591 --> 00:11:23.783
No matter your gonads,
no matter your identity,

00:11:23.807 --> 00:11:26.315
every single human being
has to have an X chromosome,

00:11:26.339 --> 00:11:29.110
because without one,
the rest of your body doesn't develop.

00:11:29.134 --> 00:11:31.302
MW: Why do we call this
the female chromosome?

00:11:31.326 --> 00:11:33.556
OK, this is something
I had never though about,

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.000
but literally, every single person
in this audience has an X chromosome,

00:11:37.024 --> 00:11:38.175
I'm not lying.

00:11:38.199 --> 00:11:40.737
Every single person on the planet
has an X chromosome,

00:11:40.761 --> 00:11:44.118
but no one is going around like,
"This is the every-person chromosome."

00:11:44.142 --> 00:11:45.317
You know?

00:11:45.341 --> 00:11:47.726
Like, somehow it's over here,
the Y is over there,

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:49.384
and they must be really different,

00:11:49.408 --> 00:11:51.511
and I'm just like,
it would be so much better

00:11:51.535 --> 00:11:53.363
if it was the every-person chromosome.

00:11:53.387 --> 00:11:56.847
And not just because I'm like,
love you all and I want you all in,

00:11:56.871 --> 00:12:02.174
but because of what we're overlooking
by the fact that we consider it female.

00:12:02.198 --> 00:12:05.959
Because I'm going to tell you
one of the craziest things I found out.

00:12:05.983 --> 00:12:09.269
Which is, when you think
about the X chromosome,

00:12:09.293 --> 00:12:12.560
of the almost 1,100 genes
on the X chromosome,

00:12:12.584 --> 00:12:15.585
how many do you think have to do
with sex and reproduction?

00:12:15.609 --> 00:12:17.742
Like, get a number in your head.

00:12:19.347 --> 00:12:20.497
Four percent.

00:12:21.736 --> 00:12:24.760
That means 96 percent
of the rest of that chromosome

00:12:24.784 --> 00:12:27.735
is doing something that has nothing
to do with your gonads.

00:12:28.466 --> 00:12:30.918
And I guess as all of these,

00:12:30.942 --> 00:12:32.728
sort of, some of them social stories,

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:35.585
some of them scientific stories,
some of these facts,

00:12:35.609 --> 00:12:38.849
started to add up, I just thought, like,

00:12:38.873 --> 00:12:41.135
why are we calling these
the sex chromosomes?

00:12:41.159 --> 00:12:43.992
Or if we are, like,
maybe we all like that name,

00:12:44.016 --> 00:12:48.007
should we just allow ourselves
to think about them

00:12:48.031 --> 00:12:49.406
a little more broadly?

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:50.724
Because if we do,

00:12:50.748 --> 00:12:55.621
like, what insights would we gain,
as people, as scientists?

00:12:55.645 --> 00:12:58.319
And we're at this point
where we're thinking about, like,

00:12:58.343 --> 00:12:59.899
how do we want to teach science,

00:12:59.923 --> 00:13:01.093
what do we want to fund,

00:13:01.117 --> 00:13:03.459
like, who do we want to be
as a society, you know?

00:13:03.483 --> 00:13:08.918
And I just wondered if it wasn't a moment
to rethink the biology of X and Y,

00:13:08.942 --> 00:13:11.117
and at the very least,

00:13:11.141 --> 00:13:13.514
to remember, like,
the footnotes of history,

00:13:13.538 --> 00:13:18.918
which is that the dude who came up
with the phrase "sex chromosome,"

00:13:18.942 --> 00:13:22.545
actually was like, "Hey, everyone,
just remember, this is just,"

00:13:22.569 --> 00:13:24.820
and I quote, "a form of shorthand."

00:13:25.887 --> 00:13:28.020
We should not take it literally.

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:29.799
Thank you.

00:13:29.823 --> 00:13:33.394
(Applause)
