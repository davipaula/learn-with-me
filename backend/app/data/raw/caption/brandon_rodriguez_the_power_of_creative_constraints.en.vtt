00:00:08.053 --> 00:00:11.023
Imagine you're asked
to invent something new.

00:00:11.023 --> 00:00:12.694
It could be whatever you want

00:00:12.694 --> 00:00:14.634
made from anything you choose

00:00:14.634 --> 00:00:17.455
in any shape or size.

00:00:17.455 --> 00:00:21.315
That kind of creative freedom
sounds so liberating, doesn't it?

00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:23.007
Or does it?

00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:27.110
If you're like most people,
you'd probably be paralyzed by this task.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.395
Without more guidance,
where would you even begin?

00:00:30.395 --> 00:00:34.625
As it turns out, boundless freedom
isn't always helpful.

00:00:34.625 --> 00:00:38.639
In reality, any project is restricted
by many factors,

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:39.785
such as the cost,

00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:42.035
what materials you have at your disposal,

00:00:42.035 --> 00:00:44.935
and unbreakable laws of physics.

00:00:44.935 --> 00:00:47.615
These factors are called 
creative constraints,

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:49.838
and they're the requirements 
and limitations

00:00:49.838 --> 00:00:54.236
we have to address 
in order to accomplish a goal.

00:00:54.236 --> 00:00:57.066
Creative constraints apply 
across professions,

00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.876
to architects and artists,

00:00:58.876 --> 00:00:59.774
writers,

00:00:59.774 --> 00:01:00.713
engineers,

00:01:00.713 --> 00:01:02.736
and scientists.

00:01:02.736 --> 00:01:05.586
In many fields, constraints play
a special role

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:09.056
as drivers of discovery and invention.

00:01:09.056 --> 00:01:11.657
During the scientific process 
in particular,

00:01:11.657 --> 00:01:15.646
constraints are an essential part
of experimental design.

00:01:15.646 --> 00:01:19.766
For instance, a scientist studying
a new virus would consider,

00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:23.287
"How can I use the tools 
and techniques at hand

00:01:23.287 --> 00:01:29.069
to create an experiment that tells me
how this virus infects the body's cells?

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:32.768
And what are the limits of my knowledge
that prevent me

00:01:32.768 --> 00:01:36.076
from understanding 
this new viral pathway?"

00:01:36.076 --> 00:01:39.748
In engineering, constraints have us
apply our scientific discoveries

00:01:39.748 --> 00:01:43.118
to invent something new and useful.

00:01:43.118 --> 00:01:46.706
Take, for example, 
the landers Viking 1 and 2,

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:51.338
which relied on thrusters to arrive
safely on the surface of Mars.

00:01:51.338 --> 00:01:52.798
The problem?

00:01:52.798 --> 00:01:56.118
Those thrusters left foreign chemicals
on the ground,

00:01:56.118 --> 00:01:58.778
contaminating soil samples.

00:01:58.778 --> 00:02:01.697
So a new constraint was introduced.

00:02:01.697 --> 00:02:04.148
How can we land a probe on Mars

00:02:04.148 --> 00:02:07.459
without introducing chemicals
from Earth?

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.769
The next Pathfinder mission used
an airbag system

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.159
to allow the rover to bounce
and roll to a halt

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:18.400
without burning contaminating fuel.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.150
Years later, we wanted to send
a much larger rover: Curiosity.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.389
However, it was too large 
for the airbag design,

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:29.019
so another constraint was defined.

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.689
How can we land a large rover
while still keeping rocket fuel

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.439
away from the Martian soil?

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.461
In response, engineers had a wild idea.

00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:41.490
They designed a skycrane.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.430
Similar to the claw machine at toy stores,

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.150
it would lower the rover 
from high above the surface.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.051
With each invention, the engineers
demonstrated an essential habit

00:02:53.051 --> 00:02:54.711
of scientific thinking -

00:02:54.711 --> 00:02:58.942
that solutions must recognize
the limitations of current technology

00:02:58.942 --> 00:03:01.392
in order to advance it.

00:03:01.392 --> 00:03:03.821
Sometimes this progress is iterative,

00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:07.873
as in, "How can I make a better
parachute to land my rover?"

00:03:07.873 --> 00:03:10.512
And sometimes, it's innovative,

00:03:10.512 --> 00:03:12.471
like how to reach our goal

00:03:12.471 --> 00:03:16.241
when the best possible 
parachute isn't going to work.

00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:19.692
In both cases, the constraints 
guide decision-making

00:03:19.692 --> 00:03:23.351
to ensure we reach each objective.

00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:26.492
Here's another Mars 
problem yet to be solved.

00:03:26.492 --> 00:03:29.832
Say we want to send astronauts
who will need water.

00:03:29.832 --> 00:03:34.432
They'd rely on a filtration system
that keeps the water very clean

00:03:34.432 --> 00:03:37.766
and enables 100% recovery.

00:03:37.766 --> 00:03:39.970
Those are some pretty tough constraints,

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.993
and we may not have 
the technology for it now.

00:03:42.993 --> 00:03:45.833
But in the process of trying 
to meet these objectives,

00:03:45.833 --> 00:03:50.801
we might discover other applications
of any inventions that result.

00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:53.713
Building an innovative 
water filtration system

00:03:53.713 --> 00:03:58.204
could provide a solution for farmers
working in drought-stricken regions,

00:03:58.204 --> 00:04:03.693
or a way to clean municipal water
in polluted cities.

00:04:03.693 --> 00:04:06.163
In fact, many scientific advances

00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:09.494
have occurred when serendipitous failures
in one field

00:04:09.494 --> 00:04:12.475
address the constraints of another.

00:04:12.475 --> 00:04:15.684
When scientist Alexander Fleming
mistakenly contaminated

00:04:15.684 --> 00:04:17.705
a Petri dish in the lab,

00:04:17.705 --> 00:04:22.634
it led to the discovery 
of the first antibiotic, penicillin.

00:04:22.634 --> 00:04:24.585
The same is true of synthetic dye,

00:04:24.585 --> 00:04:25.624
plastic,

00:04:25.624 --> 00:04:27.055
and gunpowder.

00:04:27.055 --> 00:04:29.046
All were created mistakenly,

00:04:29.046 --> 00:04:32.804
but went on to address the constraints
of other problems.

00:04:32.804 --> 00:04:37.025
Understanding constraints guides
scientific progress,

00:04:37.025 --> 00:04:41.847
and what's true in science
is also true in many other fields.

00:04:41.847 --> 00:04:47.506
Constraints aren't the boundaries
of creativity, but the foundation of it.
