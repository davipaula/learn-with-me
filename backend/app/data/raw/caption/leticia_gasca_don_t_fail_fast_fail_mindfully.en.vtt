[This talk contains mature language
Viewer discretion is advised]

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.576
If we traveled back to the year 800 BC,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.416
in Greece, we would see
that merchants whose businesses failed

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.760
were forced to sit in the marketplace
with a basket over their heads.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.576
In premodern Italy,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.976
failed business owners,
who had outstanding debts,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.776
were taken totally naked
to the public square

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.456
where they had to bang their butts
against a special stone

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.840
while a crowd jeered at them.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.816
In the 17th century in France,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.656
failed business owners
were taken to the center of the market,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.416
where the beginning of their bankruptcy
was publicly announced.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.696
And in order to avoid
immediate imprisonment,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.776
they had to wear a green bonnet

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.160
so that everyone knew they were a failure.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.216
Of course, these are extreme examples.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.296
But it is important to remember

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.656
that when we excessively
punish those who fail,

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.816
we stifle innovation
and business creation,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.400
the engines of economic growth
in any country.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.216
Time has passed, and today we don't
publicly humiliate failed entrepreneurs.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.440
And they don't broadcast
their failures on social media.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.656
In fact, I think that all of us
can relate with the pain of failure.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.096
But we don't share the details
of those experiences.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.456
And I totally get it, my friends,
I have also been there.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.136
I had a business that failed

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.896
and sharing that story
was incredibly hard.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.296
In fact, it required seven years,
a good dose of vulnerability

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.040
and the company of my friends.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.680
This is my failure story.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.376
When I was in college, studying business,
I met a group of indigenous women.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.776
They lived in a poor rural community
in the state of Puebla, in central Mexico.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.096
They made beautiful handmade products.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.056
And when I met them and I saw their work,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.080
I decided I wanted to help.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.176
With some friends,
I cofounded a social enterprise

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.016
with the mission to help the women
create an income stream

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.280
and improve their quality of life.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.856
We did everything by the book,

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.496
as we had learned in business school.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.936
We got investors,

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.616
we spent a lot of time building
the business and training the women.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.416
But soon we realized we were novices.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.696
The handmade products were not selling,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.416
and the financial plan we had made
was totally unrealistic.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.696
In fact, we worked
for years without a salary,

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.056
hoping that a miracle would happen,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.776
that magically a great buyer would arrive

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.120
and she would make
the business profitable.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.960
But that miracle never happened.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.736
In the end, we had to close the business,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.040
and that broke my heart.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.296
I started everything
to create a positive impact

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.416
on the life of the artisans.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.760
And I felt that I have done the opposite.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.096
I felt so guilty

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.416
that I decided to hide this failure

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.896
from my conversations
and my resume for years.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.376
I didn't know other failed entrepreneurs,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.760
and I thought I was
the only loser in the world.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.776
One night, seven years later,
I was out with some friends

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.296
and we were talking
about the life of the entrepreneur.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.680
And of course,
the issue of failure came out.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.896
I decided to confess to my friends
the story of my failed business.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.656
And they shared similar stories.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.976
In that moment, a thought
became really clear in my mind:

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.216
all of my friends were failures.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.296
(Laughter)

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.336
Being more serious, that night I realized

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.456
that A: I wasn't
the only loser in the world,

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.496
and B: we all have hidden failures.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.360
Please tell me if that is not true.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.856
That night was like an exorcism for me.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.416
I realized that sharing your failures
makes you stronger, not weaker.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.776
And being open to my vulnerability

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.176
helped me connect with others
in a deeper and more meaningful way

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.200
and embrace life lessons
I wouldn't have learned previously.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.296
As a consequence of this experience

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.656
of sharing stories
of businesses that didn't work,

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.096
we decided to create a platform of events

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.176
to help others
share their failure stories.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.520
And we called it Fuckup Nights.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.096
Years later, we also created
a research center

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.936
devoted to the story of failure

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.936
and its implications
on business, people and society

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.640
and as we love cool names,
we called it the Failure Institute.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.496
It has been surprising to see

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.336
that when an entrepreneur
stands on a stage

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.296
and shares a story of failure,

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.496
she can actually enjoy that experience.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.536
It doesn't have to be a moment
of shame and embarrassment,

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.736
as it used to be in the past.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.256
It is an opportunity
to share lessons learned

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.056
and build empathy.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.576
We have also discovered

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.696
that when the members of a team
share their failures, magic happens.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.760
Bonds grow stronger
and collaboration becomes easier.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.936
Through our events and research projects,

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.616
we have found some interesting facts.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.896
For instance, that men and women
react in a different way

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.336
after the failure of a business.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.256
The most common reaction among men

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.096
is to start a new business
within one year of failure,

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.256
but in a different sector,

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.056
while women decide to look for a job

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.176
and postpone the creation
of a new business.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.496
Our hypothesis is that this happens

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.816
because women tend to suffer more
from the impostor syndrome.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.816
We feel that we need something else
to be a good entrepreneur.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:33.656
But I have seen that in many, many cases
women have everything that's needed.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.920
We just need to take the step.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.216
And in the case of men,

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.496
it is more common to see that they feel
they have enough knowledge

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.160
and just need to put it in practice
in another place with better luck.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.416
Another interesting finding has been

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.000
that there are regional differences
on how entrepreneurs cope with failure.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.096
For instance, the most common reaction

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.456
after the failure of a business
in the American continent

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.656
is to go back to school.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.256
While in Europe, the most common reaction
is to look for a therapist.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.896
(Laughter)

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.936
We're not sure which is a better reaction
after the failure of a business,

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.160
but this is something
we will study in the future.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.096
Another interesting finding has been

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:28.776
the profound impact that public policy
has on failed entrepreneurs.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.296
For instance, in my country, in Mexico,

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.616
the regulatory environment is so hard,

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:39.656
that closing a business can take you
a lot of time and a lot of money.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.680
Let's begin with the money.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.336
In the best possible scenario,

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.976
meaning you don't have
problems with partners,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.696
providers, clients, employees,

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.776
in the best possible scenario,

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.976
officially closing a business
will cost you 2,000 dollars.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.096
Which is a lot of money in Mexico.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.336
Someone who earns the minimum wage

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.840
would have to work for 15 months
to save this amount.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.136
Now, let's talk about the time.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.376
As you may know,
in most of the developing world,

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.400
the average life expectancy
of a business is two years.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:20.800
In Mexico, the process of officially
closing a business takes two years.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.376
What happens when the average
life expectancy of a business

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:30.400
is so similar to the time it will take you
to close it if it doesn't work?

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.176
Of course, this discourages
business creation

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.000
and promotes informal economy.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.416
In fact, econometric research has proved

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:44.936
that if the process of declaring
bankruptcy takes less time and less money,

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.679
more new firms will enter the market.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.336
For this reason, in 2017,

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.775
we proposed a series
of public policy recommendations

00:08:54.799 --> 00:08:59.096
for the procedure of officially
closing businesses in Mexico.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.776
For a whole year,

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.136
we worked with entrepreneurs
from all over the country

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.616
and with Congress.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.120
And the good news is that we managed
to help change the law.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.456
Yay!

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.496
(Applause)

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.216
The idea is that when
the new regulation comes into force,

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.336
entrepreneurs will be able to close
their businesses in an online procedure

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.800
that is faster and inexpensive.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.616
(Sighs)

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.856
On the night we invented Fuckup Nights,

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:35.360
we never imagined that the movement
would grow this big.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.736
We are in 80 countries now.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.536
In that moment, our only intention

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.936
was to put the topic
of failure on the table.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.656
To help our friends see that failure
is something we must talk about.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:53.296
It is not a cause of humiliation,
as it used to be in the past,

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.080
or a cause of celebration,
as some people say.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.840
In fact, I want to confess something.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.976
Every time I listen
to Silicon Valley types or students

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.640
bragging about failing fast and often
like it's no big deal, I cringe.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:16.400
Because I think that there is a dark side
on the mantra "fail fast."

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.336
Of course, failing fast
is a great way to accelerate learning

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.216
and avoid wasting time.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.776
But I fear that when
we present rapid failure

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.656
to entrepreneurs
as their one and only option,

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.096
we might be promoting laziness.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.520
We might be promoting
that entrepreneurs give up too easily.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.336
I also fear that the culture
of rapid failure

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.176
could be minimizing
the devastating consequences

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.840
of the failure of a business.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.096
For instance, when
my social enterprise died,

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:54.616
the worst part was that I had to go back
to the indigenous community

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.616
and tell the women
that the business had failed

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.400
and it was my fault.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:05.256
For some people this could be seen
like a great learning opportunity for me,

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.336
but the truth is that
the closure of this business

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.920
represented much more than that.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.856
It meant that the women
would stop receiving an income

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.600
that they really needed.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.976
For this reason,
I want to propose something.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.096
I want to propose
that just as we put aside the idea

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.336
of publicly humiliating
failed entrepreneurs,

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:34.336
we must put aside the idea
that failing fast is always the best.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.136
And I want to propose a new mantra:

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.496
fail mindfully.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:43.416
We must remember that businesses
are made of people,

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.816
businesses are not entities
that appear and disappear

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.536
magically without consequences.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.856
When a firm dies,
some people will lose their jobs.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.256
And others will lose their money.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.696
And in the case
of social and green enterprises,

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.976
the death of this business
can have a negative impact

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.440
on the ecosystems or communities
they were trying to serve.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.456
But what does it mean to fail mindfully?

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:16.216
It means being aware of the impact,
of the consequences

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.120
of the failure of that business.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.440
Being aware of the lessons learned.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.456
And being aware of the responsibility

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.680
to share those learnings with the world.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.616
Thank you.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.080
