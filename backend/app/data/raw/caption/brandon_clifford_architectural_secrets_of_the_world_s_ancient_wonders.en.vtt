00:00:12.917 --> 00:00:15.643
Do you think the things we build today

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:17.833
will be considered wonders in the future?

00:00:19.042 --> 00:00:20.684
Think of Stonehenge,

00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:22.226
the Pyramids,

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.917
Machu Picchu and Easter Island.

00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:29.083
Now, they're all pretty different
from what we're doing today,

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.768
with those massive stones,

00:00:32.792 --> 00:00:36.917
assembled in complex
but seemingly illogical ways,

00:00:38.292 --> 00:00:41.934
and all traces of their construction

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.601
erased,

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:45.667
shrouding them in mystery.

00:00:47.417 --> 00:00:51.125
It seems like people could not
have possibly built these things,

00:00:52.583 --> 00:00:53.875
because people didn't.

00:00:54.792 --> 00:00:59.101
They were carefully crafted
by a primordial race of giants

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:00.393
known as Cyclops.

00:01:00.417 --> 00:01:01.726
(Laughter)

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.976
And I've been collaborating
with these monsters

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.250
to learn their secrets
for moving those massive stones.

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:12.167
And as it turns out,
Cyclops aren't even that strong.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.375
They're just really smart
about getting material to work for them.

00:01:19.042 --> 00:01:23.476
Now, the videos you see behind me
of large, stone-like, wobbly creatures

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.333
are the results of this collaboration.

00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:29.792
OK, so Cyclops might be
a mythical creature,

00:01:30.917 --> 00:01:33.768
but those wonders are still real.

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:35.042
People made them.

00:01:35.917 --> 00:01:38.500
But they also made the myths
that surround them,

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:43.476
and when it comes to wonders,
there's this thick connective tissue

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.958
between mythology and reality.

00:01:47.083 --> 00:01:48.750
Take Easter Island, for example.

00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:53.101
When the Dutch explorers
first encountered the island,

00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:55.143
they asked the people of Rapa Nui

00:01:55.167 --> 00:01:58.583
how their ancestors could have possibly
moved those massive statues.

00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:01.809
And the Rapa Nui said,

00:02:01.833 --> 00:02:05.476
"Our ancestors didn't move the statues,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.625
because the statues walked themselves."

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.250
For centuries, this was dismissed,
but actually it's true.

00:02:13.083 --> 00:02:18.476
The statues, known as moai,
were transported standing,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.458
pivoting from side to side.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.018
OK?

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:26.976
As spectacular as the moai are
for visitors today,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.518
you have to imagine being there then,

00:02:29.542 --> 00:02:32.934
with colossal moai
marching around the island.

00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:38.143
Because the real memorial
was not the objects themselves,

00:02:38.167 --> 00:02:42.083
it was the cultural ritual
of bringing a stone to life.

00:02:43.708 --> 00:02:46.292
So as an architect,
I've been chasing that dream.

00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:52.000
How can we shift our idea of construction
to accommodate that mythical side?

00:02:53.583 --> 00:02:55.726
So what I've been doing
is challenging myself

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.851
with putting on a series of performances

00:02:58.875 --> 00:03:01.476
of the ancient but
pretty straightforward task

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.518
of just moving and standing
big heavy objects,

00:03:05.542 --> 00:03:09.476
like this 16-foot-tall megalith
designed to walk across land

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.750
and stand vertically;

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.393
or this 4,000-pound behemoth
that springs itself to life

00:03:16.417 --> 00:03:18.000
to dance onstage.

00:03:19.792 --> 00:03:23.143
And what I've found is
that by thinking of architecture

00:03:23.167 --> 00:03:26.726
not as an end product but as a performance

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.101
from conception to completion,

00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:33.625
we end up rediscovering some really smart
ways to build things today.

00:03:35.375 --> 00:03:38.143
You know, so much of the discussion
surrounding our future

00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:42.143
focuses on technology,
efficiency and speed.

00:03:42.167 --> 00:03:44.226
But if I've learned anything from Cyclops,

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.768
it's that wonders
can be smart, spectacular

00:03:48.792 --> 00:03:50.476
and sustainable --

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.667
because of their mass and their mystery.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.809
And while people still want to know
how those ancient wonders were built,

00:03:57.833 --> 00:04:00.643
I've been asking Cyclops
how to create the mystery

00:04:00.667 --> 00:04:03.125
that compels people
to ask that very question.

00:04:04.375 --> 00:04:06.434
Because in an era
where we design buildings

00:04:06.458 --> 00:04:09.042
to last 30, maybe 60 years,

00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:12.518
I would love to learn
how to create something

00:04:12.542 --> 00:04:14.304
that could entertain for an eternity.

00:04:15.083 --> 00:04:16.351
Thank you.

00:04:16.375 --> 00:04:21.167
(Applause)
