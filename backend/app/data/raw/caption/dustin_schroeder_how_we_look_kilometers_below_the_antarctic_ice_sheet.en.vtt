00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.016
I'm a radio glaciologist.

00:00:15.397 --> 00:00:19.269
That means that I use radar
to study glaciers and ice sheets.

00:00:19.705 --> 00:00:21.728
And like most glaciologists right now,

00:00:21.752 --> 00:00:23.820
I'm working on the problem of estimating

00:00:23.844 --> 00:00:28.004
how much the ice is going to contribute
to sea level rise in the future.

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:30.142
So today, I want to talk to you about

00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:33.903
why it's so hard to put good numbers
on sea level rise,

00:00:33.927 --> 00:00:37.967
and why I believe that by changing
the way we think about radar technology

00:00:37.991 --> 00:00:39.379
and earth-science education,

00:00:39.403 --> 00:00:41.157
we can get much better at it.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.332
When most scientists
talk about sea level rise,

00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:45.737
they show a plot like this.

00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:48.547
This is produced using ice sheet
and climate models.

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.307
On the right, you can see
the range of sea level

00:00:51.331 --> 00:00:54.529
predicted by these models
over the next 100 years.

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:57.505
For context, this is current sea level,

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:58.927
and this is the sea level

00:00:58.951 --> 00:01:02.505
above which more than 4 million people
could be vulnerable to displacement.

00:01:02.863 --> 00:01:04.633
So in terms of planning,

00:01:04.657 --> 00:01:07.839
the uncertainty in this plot
is already large.

00:01:07.863 --> 00:01:12.537
However, beyond that, this plot comes
with the asterisk and the caveat,

00:01:12.561 --> 00:01:15.482
"... unless the West Antarctic
Ice Sheet collapses."

00:01:15.506 --> 00:01:19.069
And in that case, we would be talking
about dramatically higher numbers.

00:01:19.093 --> 00:01:21.061
They'd literally be off the chart.

00:01:21.671 --> 00:01:24.736
And the reason we should take
that possibility seriously

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.340
is that we know from the geologic
history of the Earth

00:01:27.364 --> 00:01:29.522
that there were periods in its history

00:01:29.546 --> 00:01:32.187
when sea level rose
much more quickly than today.

00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:34.236
And right now, we cannot rule out

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.712
the possibility of that
happening in the future.

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:40.761
So why can't we say with confidence

00:01:40.785 --> 00:01:45.982
whether or not a significant portion
of a continent-scale ice sheet

00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:48.107
will or will not collapse?

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.784
Well, in order to do that, we need models

00:01:50.808 --> 00:01:54.389
that we know include all of the processes,
conditions and physics

00:01:54.413 --> 00:01:56.811
that would be involved
in a collapse like that.

00:01:57.206 --> 00:01:58.666
And that's hard to know,

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.424
because those processes
and conditions are taking place

00:02:01.448 --> 00:02:03.287
beneath kilometers of ice,

00:02:03.311 --> 00:02:05.861
and satellites, like the one
that produced this image,

00:02:05.885 --> 00:02:07.310
are blind to observe them.

00:02:07.713 --> 00:02:11.997
In fact, we have much more comprehensive
observations of the surface of Mars

00:02:12.021 --> 00:02:14.683
than we do of what's beneath
the Antarctic ice sheet.

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:19.036
And this is even more challenging
in that we need these observations

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.256
at a gigantic scale
in both space and time.

00:02:22.687 --> 00:02:24.935
In terms of space, this is a continent.

00:02:25.322 --> 00:02:27.442
And in the same way that in North America,

00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:31.506
the Rocky Mountains, Everglades
and Great Lakes regions are very distinct,

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.521
so are the subsurface
regions of Antarctica.

00:02:34.545 --> 00:02:36.188
And in terms of time, we now know

00:02:36.212 --> 00:02:40.553
that ice sheets not only evolve over
the timescale of millennia and centuries,

00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:44.363
but they're also changing
over the scale of years and days.

00:02:44.387 --> 00:02:48.696
So what we want is observations
beneath kilometers of ice

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.649
at the scale of a continent,

00:02:50.673 --> 00:02:52.318
and we want them all the time.

00:02:53.014 --> 00:02:54.414
So how do we do this?

00:02:54.814 --> 00:02:58.870
Well, we're not totally blind
to the subsurface.

00:02:58.894 --> 00:03:01.564
I said in the beginning
that I was a radio glaciologist,

00:03:01.588 --> 00:03:03.466
and the reason that that's a thing

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.260
is that airborne ice-penetrating radar
is the main tool we have

00:03:07.284 --> 00:03:08.880
to see inside of ice sheets.

00:03:09.212 --> 00:03:13.058
So most of the data used by my group
is collected by airplanes

00:03:13.082 --> 00:03:15.307
like this World War II-era DC-3,

00:03:15.331 --> 00:03:17.783
that actually fought
in the Battle of the Bulge.

00:03:17.807 --> 00:03:20.387
You can see the antennas
underneath the wing.

00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:24.141
These are used to transmit
radar signals down into the ice.

00:03:24.165 --> 00:03:26.618
And the echos that come back
contain information

00:03:26.642 --> 00:03:29.579
about what's happening inside
and beneath the ice sheet.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.847
While this is happening,

00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:34.156
scientists and engineers
are on the airplane

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.667
for eight hours at a stretch,

00:03:35.691 --> 00:03:37.560
making sure that the radar's working.

00:03:37.996 --> 00:03:40.537
And I think this is actually
a misconception

00:03:40.561 --> 00:03:42.005
about this type of fieldwork,

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:45.176
where people imagine
scientists peering out the window,

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.114
contemplating the landscape,
its geologic context

00:03:48.138 --> 00:03:49.856
and the fate of the ice sheets.

00:03:50.327 --> 00:03:53.950
We actually had a guy from the BBC's
"Frozen Planet" on one of these flights.

00:03:53.974 --> 00:03:56.696
And he spent, like, hours
videotaping us turn knobs.

00:03:57.046 --> 00:03:59.649
(Laughter)

00:03:59.673 --> 00:04:03.049
And I was actually watching the series
years later with my wife,

00:04:03.073 --> 00:04:06.496
and a scene like this came up,
and I commented on how beautiful it was.

00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:09.931
And she said, "Weren't you
on that flight?"

00:04:09.955 --> 00:04:11.114
(Laughter)

00:04:11.138 --> 00:04:14.083
I said, "Yeah, but I was looking
at a computer screen."

00:04:14.107 --> 00:04:15.363
(Laughter)

00:04:15.387 --> 00:04:17.594
So when you think
about this type of fieldwork,

00:04:17.618 --> 00:04:19.641
don't think about images like this.

00:04:19.665 --> 00:04:21.356
Think about images like this.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.543
(Laughter)

00:04:22.567 --> 00:04:25.909
This is a radargram, which is
a vertical profile through the ice sheet,

00:04:25.933 --> 00:04:27.417
kind of like a slice of cake.

00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:30.617
The bright layer on the top
is the surface of the ice sheet,

00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:33.971
the bright layer on the bottom
is the bedrock of the continent itself,

00:04:33.995 --> 00:04:36.521
and the layers in between
are kind of like tree rings,

00:04:36.545 --> 00:04:39.752
in that they contain information
about the history of the ice sheet.

00:04:39.776 --> 00:04:42.006
And it's amazing
that this works this well.

00:04:42.321 --> 00:04:44.339
The ground-penetrating
radars that are used

00:04:44.363 --> 00:04:47.291
to investigate infrastructures of roads
or detect land mines

00:04:47.315 --> 00:04:49.474
struggle to get through
a few meters of earth.

00:04:49.498 --> 00:04:52.254
And here we're peering
through three kilometers of ice.

00:04:52.278 --> 00:04:56.118
And there are sophisticated, interesting,
electromagnetic reasons for that,

00:04:56.142 --> 00:05:00.293
but let's say for now that ice
is basically the perfect target for radar,

00:05:00.317 --> 00:05:03.545
and radar is basically
the perfect tool to study ice sheets.

00:05:04.641 --> 00:05:05.920
These are the flight lines

00:05:05.944 --> 00:05:08.988
of most of the modern airborne
radar-sounding profiles

00:05:09.012 --> 00:05:10.726
collected over Antarctica.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.720
This is the result
of heroic efforts over decades

00:05:13.744 --> 00:05:17.369
by teams from a variety of countries
and international collaborations.

00:05:17.672 --> 00:05:20.529
And when you put those together,
you get an image like this,

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:23.259
which is what the continent
of Antarctica would look like

00:05:23.283 --> 00:05:24.629
without all the ice on top.

00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:30.490
And you can really see the diversity
of the continent in an image like this.

00:05:30.514 --> 00:05:32.926
The red features
are volcanoes or mountains;

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.060
the areas that are blue
would be open ocean

00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:36.664
if the ice sheet was removed.

00:05:36.688 --> 00:05:39.322
This is that giant spatial scale.

00:05:39.807 --> 00:05:42.808
However, all of this
that took decades to produce

00:05:42.832 --> 00:05:45.834
is just one snapshot of the subsurface.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.433
It does not give us any indication
of how the ice sheet is changing in time.

00:05:51.338 --> 00:05:53.755
Now, we're working on that,
because it turns out

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:57.228
that the very first radar observations
of Antarctica were collected

00:05:57.252 --> 00:05:59.630
using 35 millimeter optical film.

00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:02.212
And there were thousands
of reels of this film

00:06:02.236 --> 00:06:05.490
in the archives of the museum
of the Scott Polar Research Institute

00:06:05.514 --> 00:06:07.016
at the University of Cambridge.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.621
So last summer, I took
a state-of-the-art film scanner

00:06:09.645 --> 00:06:13.201
that was developed for digitizing
Hollywood films and remastering them,

00:06:13.225 --> 00:06:14.376
and two art historians,

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.618
and we went over to England,
put on some gloves

00:06:16.642 --> 00:06:19.156
and archived and digitized
all of that film.

00:06:19.744 --> 00:06:22.839
So that produced two million
high-resolution images

00:06:22.863 --> 00:06:26.061
that my group is now working
on analyzing and processing

00:06:26.085 --> 00:06:29.029
for comparing with contemporary
conditions in the ice sheet.

00:06:29.458 --> 00:06:31.850
And, actually, that scanner --
I found out about it

00:06:31.874 --> 00:06:35.260
from an archivist at the Academy
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

00:06:35.284 --> 00:06:37.808
So I'd like to thank the Academy --

00:06:37.832 --> 00:06:40.077
(Laughter)

00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:41.419
for making this possible.

00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:42.498
(Laughter)

00:06:42.522 --> 00:06:44.219
And as amazing as it is

00:06:44.243 --> 00:06:47.879
that we can look at what was happening
under the ice sheet 50 years ago,

00:06:47.903 --> 00:06:50.585
this is still just one more snapshot.

00:06:50.609 --> 00:06:52.726
It doesn't give us observations

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.923
of the variation at the annual
or seasonal scale,

00:06:55.947 --> 00:06:57.283
that we know matters.

00:06:57.926 --> 00:06:59.490
There's some progress here, too.

00:06:59.514 --> 00:07:03.038
There are these recent ground-based
radar systems that stay in one spot.

00:07:03.062 --> 00:07:05.675
So you take these radars
and put them on the ice sheet

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:07.589
and you bury a cache of car batteries.

00:07:07.613 --> 00:07:10.423
And you leave them out there
for months or years at a time,

00:07:10.447 --> 00:07:12.559
and they send a pulse down
into the ice sheet

00:07:12.583 --> 00:07:14.081
every so many minutes or hours.

00:07:14.105 --> 00:07:16.512
So this gives you
continuous observation in time --

00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.108
but at one spot.

00:07:18.418 --> 00:07:22.808
So if you compare that imaging to the 2-D
pictures provided by the airplane,

00:07:22.832 --> 00:07:24.689
this is just one vertical line.

00:07:25.498 --> 00:07:28.354
And this is pretty much
where we are as a field right now.

00:07:28.378 --> 00:07:31.036
We can choose between
good spatial coverage

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.553
with airborne radar sounding

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:36.386
and good temporal coverage in one spot
with ground-based sounding.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.721
But neither gives us what we really want:

00:07:38.745 --> 00:07:40.086
both at the same time.

00:07:40.753 --> 00:07:42.190
And if we're going to do that,

00:07:42.214 --> 00:07:45.221
we're going to need totally new ways
of observing the ice sheet.

00:07:45.245 --> 00:07:47.966
And ideally, those should be
extremely low-cost

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:51.225
so that we can take lots
of measurements from lots of sensors.

00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:54.014
Well, for existing radar systems,

00:07:54.038 --> 00:07:57.082
the biggest driver of cost
is the power required

00:07:57.106 --> 00:07:59.403
to transmit the radar signal itself.

00:08:00.187 --> 00:08:03.482
So it’d be great if we were able
to use existing radio systems

00:08:03.506 --> 00:08:06.228
or radio signals
that are in the environment.

00:08:06.252 --> 00:08:09.101
And fortunately, the entire field
of radio astronomy

00:08:09.125 --> 00:08:12.910
is built on the fact that there
are bright radio signals in the sky.

00:08:12.934 --> 00:08:15.235
And a really bright one is our sun.

00:08:15.259 --> 00:08:18.719
So, actually, one of the most exciting
things my group is doing right now

00:08:18.743 --> 00:08:22.330
is trying to use the radio emissions
from the sun as a type of radar signal.

00:08:22.354 --> 00:08:24.541
This is one of our field tests at Big Sur.

00:08:24.565 --> 00:08:28.723
That PVC pipe ziggurat is an antenna stand
some undergrads in my lab built.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.083
And the idea here
is that we stay out at Big Sur,

00:08:32.107 --> 00:08:34.545
and we watch the sunset
in radio frequencies,

00:08:34.569 --> 00:08:39.130
and we try and detect the reflection
of the sun off the surface of the ocean.

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:43.381
Now, I know you're thinking,
"There are no glaciers at Big Sur."

00:08:43.405 --> 00:08:44.490
(Laughter)

00:08:44.514 --> 00:08:45.672
And that's true.

00:08:45.696 --> 00:08:46.876
(Laughter)

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.600
But it turns out that detecting
the reflection of the sun

00:08:50.624 --> 00:08:51.982
off the surface of the ocean

00:08:52.006 --> 00:08:54.808
and detecting the reflection
off the bottom of an ice sheet

00:08:54.832 --> 00:08:56.573
are extremely geophysically similar.

00:08:56.597 --> 00:08:57.796
And if this works,

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:01.225
we should be able to apply the same
measurement principle in Antarctica.

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:03.289
And this is not
as far-fetched as it seems.

00:09:03.313 --> 00:09:07.066
The seismic industry has gone through
a similar technique-development exercise,

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:10.220
where they were able to move
from detonating dynamite as a source,

00:09:10.244 --> 00:09:12.733
to using ambient seismic noise
in the environment.

00:09:12.757 --> 00:09:16.590
And defense radars use TV signals
and radio signals all the time,

00:09:16.614 --> 00:09:19.193
so they don't have to transmit
a signal of radar

00:09:19.217 --> 00:09:20.868
and give away their position.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.878
So what I'm saying is,
this might really work.

00:09:23.902 --> 00:09:27.104
And if it does, we're going to need
extremely low-cost sensors

00:09:27.128 --> 00:09:30.717
so we can deploy networks of hundreds
or thousands of these on an ice sheet

00:09:30.741 --> 00:09:31.892
to do imaging.

00:09:31.916 --> 00:09:35.522
And that's where the technological stars
have really aligned to help us.

00:09:35.546 --> 00:09:37.950
Those earlier radar systems I talked about

00:09:37.974 --> 00:09:41.607
were developed by experienced
engineers over the course of years

00:09:41.631 --> 00:09:42.980
at national facilities

00:09:43.004 --> 00:09:44.980
with expensive specialized equipment.

00:09:45.354 --> 00:09:48.244
But the recent developments
in software-defined radio,

00:09:48.268 --> 00:09:50.514
rapid fabrication and the maker movement,

00:09:50.538 --> 00:09:53.490
make it so that it's possible
for a team of teenagers

00:09:53.514 --> 00:09:56.156
working in my lab over the course
of a handful of months

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.625
to build a prototype radar.

00:09:58.045 --> 00:10:00.854
OK, they're not any teenagers,
they’re Stanford undergrads,

00:10:00.878 --> 00:10:02.525
but the point holds --

00:10:02.549 --> 00:10:03.973
(Laughter)

00:10:03.997 --> 00:10:07.300
that these enabling technologies
are letting us break down the barrier

00:10:07.324 --> 00:10:11.135
between engineers who build instruments
and scientists that use them.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:15.531
And by teaching engineering students
to think like earth scientists

00:10:15.555 --> 00:10:18.233
and earth-science students
who can think like engineers,

00:10:18.257 --> 00:10:22.490
my lab is building an environment in which
we can build custom radar sensors

00:10:22.514 --> 00:10:24.124
for each problem at hand,

00:10:24.148 --> 00:10:27.585
that are optimized for low cost
and high performance

00:10:27.609 --> 00:10:29.077
for that problem.

00:10:29.101 --> 00:10:32.578
And that's going to totally change
the way we observe ice sheets.

00:10:32.998 --> 00:10:38.079
Look, the sea level problem and the role
of the cryosphere in sea level rise

00:10:38.103 --> 00:10:39.688
is extremely important

00:10:39.712 --> 00:10:41.386
and will affect the entire world.

00:10:41.815 --> 00:10:43.903
But that is not why I work on it.

00:10:44.458 --> 00:10:47.573
I work on it for the opportunity
to teach and mentor

00:10:47.597 --> 00:10:49.384
extremely brilliant students,

00:10:49.804 --> 00:10:52.913
because I deeply believe
that teams of hypertalented,

00:10:52.937 --> 00:10:55.429
hyperdriven, hyperpassionate young people

00:10:55.453 --> 00:10:58.000
can solve most of the challenges
facing the world,

00:10:58.577 --> 00:11:02.589
and that providing the observations
required to estimate sea level rise

00:11:02.613 --> 00:11:06.303
is just one of the many such problems
they can and will solve.

00:11:06.768 --> 00:11:07.920
Thank you.

00:11:07.944 --> 00:11:10.586
(Applause)
