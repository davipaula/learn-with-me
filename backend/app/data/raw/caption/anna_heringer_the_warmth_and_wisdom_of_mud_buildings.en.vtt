00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:16.453
It was the end of October
in the mountains in Austria.

00:00:17.442 --> 00:00:20.878
I was there on a field trip
with my architecture students from Zurich.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.026
And when we reached a high valley,

00:00:25.799 --> 00:00:28.268
I surprised them with the news
that there was no hut

00:00:28.292 --> 00:00:29.910
or hotel booked for the night.

00:00:31.552 --> 00:00:33.219
It was not a mistake.

00:00:33.243 --> 00:00:35.131
It was totally on purpose.

00:00:37.093 --> 00:00:40.910
The challenge was to build our own shelter
with whatever we could find.

00:00:42.662 --> 00:00:44.054
And we all survived.

00:00:44.078 --> 00:00:46.371
It was cold, it was really tough ...

00:00:47.022 --> 00:00:49.705
and it was a great learning experience

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:53.539
to discover that there are a lot
of resources given by nature for free,

00:00:53.563 --> 00:00:57.380
and all that we need
is our sensitivity to see them ...

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.210
and our creativity to use them.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.417
I found myself in a similar situation.

00:01:06.425 --> 00:01:10.926
When I was an architecture student
about 13 years ago,

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.239
I went to Bangladesh
to a remote village called Rudrapur

00:01:14.263 --> 00:01:17.628
with the aim to design and build
a school as my thesis project.

00:01:18.188 --> 00:01:21.383
I had lived in that village before
when I was 19 and a volunteer

00:01:21.407 --> 00:01:24.344
at Dipshikha, a Bangladeshi NGO
for rural development.

00:01:24.368 --> 00:01:26.050
And what I had learned from them

00:01:26.074 --> 00:01:30.852
was that the most sustainable strategy
for sustainable development

00:01:30.876 --> 00:01:36.035
is to cherish and to use
your very own resources and potential,

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:39.488
and not get dependent on external factors.

00:01:39.512 --> 00:01:42.368
And this is what I tried to do
with my architecture as well.

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:46.740
In terms of suitable building
materials for my school,

00:01:46.764 --> 00:01:48.192
I didn't have to look far.

00:01:48.718 --> 00:01:50.573
They were right under my feet:

00:01:51.732 --> 00:01:55.587
mud, earth, dirt, clay,
however you call it ...

00:01:56.788 --> 00:01:59.121
and bamboo that was growing all around.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.535
Electricity in remote Bangladesh is rare,

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:06.765
but we didn't need it.

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.388
We had human energy

00:02:08.412 --> 00:02:10.610
and the people were happy
to have the work.

00:02:12.188 --> 00:02:14.127
Tools were an issue, too,

00:02:14.151 --> 00:02:15.714
but we had these guys,

00:02:15.738 --> 00:02:17.166
water buffalos.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.866
We had also tried a bit cows,

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.469
but interestingly,
they were too intelligent.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.906
They were always stepping
in the holes of the previous round.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.788
They wouldn't mix the mud, the straw --

00:02:28.812 --> 00:02:29.862
(Laughter)

00:02:29.886 --> 00:02:32.521
the sand, which are
the ingredients in the walls.

00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:36.545
And except a small team of consultants

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.672
like my partner
for realization, Eike Roswag,

00:02:38.696 --> 00:02:41.314
and my basket-weaver cousin, Emmanuel,

00:02:41.338 --> 00:02:45.696
it was all built by craftsmen
from the village.

00:02:47.613 --> 00:02:50.897
And this is the METI school
after six months of construction.

00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:53.264
(Applause)

00:02:53.288 --> 00:02:54.447
Thank you.

00:02:54.471 --> 00:02:56.073
(Applause)

00:02:56.097 --> 00:03:00.202
Load-bearing earth walls
that really ground the school,

00:03:00.226 --> 00:03:03.820
and large bamboo structures
that bring the lightness in.

00:03:05.635 --> 00:03:08.056
That's the classroom on the ground floor.

00:03:09.072 --> 00:03:10.842
Attached to it are the caves.

00:03:11.763 --> 00:03:14.177
They're for reading,
for snuggling, for solo work,

00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:15.843
for meditation, for playing ...

00:03:16.891 --> 00:03:18.644
and the classroom on the top.

00:03:21.831 --> 00:03:25.614
The children all signed
with their names in Bengali the doors,

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:28.979
and they did not only sign,
they also helped building the school.

00:03:30.207 --> 00:03:33.109
And I'm sure you all had your hands
in mud or clay before.

00:03:33.133 --> 00:03:34.946
It's wonderful to touch. I love it.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.310
The children loved it.

00:03:36.894 --> 00:03:41.749
And can you imagine the feeling
of a small boy or a girl

00:03:41.773 --> 00:03:45.702
or an illiterate day laborer standing
in front of that school building

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:47.267
and knowing that you built this

00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:50.885
out of the ordinary bamboo
and just the dirt underneath your feet,

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.555
using nothing but your hands?

00:03:55.561 --> 00:04:01.238
That gives such an enormous boost
of trust and confidence

00:04:01.262 --> 00:04:03.278
in yourself and the community.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.294
And in the material.

00:04:07.348 --> 00:04:10.217
Especially mud has a very poor image.

00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:13.345
When we think of mud, we think of dirt --

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:15.583
it's ugly, it's nondurable --

00:04:15.607 --> 00:04:18.138
and this is the image I want to change.

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:22.906
In fact, it's the 11th rainy season
for this school now,

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.184
really harsh, horizontal monsoon rains,

00:04:26.208 --> 00:04:28.755
and the walls are standing strong.

00:04:29.131 --> 00:04:33.640
(Applause)

00:04:33.664 --> 00:04:35.006
So how does it work?

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.186
First rule, a good foundation
that keeps the wall dry from the ground,

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.906
and second rule, a good roof
that protects from the top,

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.440
and third rule, erosion control.

00:04:46.193 --> 00:04:48.479
Mud walls need speed breakers

00:04:48.503 --> 00:04:52.711
so that the rainwater
cannot run down the wall fast,

00:04:52.735 --> 00:04:56.017
and these speed breakers
could be lines of bamboo

00:04:56.041 --> 00:04:59.622
or stones or straw mixed into the mud,

00:04:59.646 --> 00:05:04.907
just like a hill needs trees or rocks
in order to prevent erosion.

00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:06.304
It works just the same way.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.373
And people always ask me
if I have to add cement to the mud,

00:05:11.397 --> 00:05:12.872
and the answer is no.

00:05:13.311 --> 00:05:17.050
There is no stabilizer,
no coating on these walls,

00:05:17.074 --> 00:05:18.398
only in the foundation.

00:05:20.294 --> 00:05:22.112
So this is the close-up of the wall

00:05:22.136 --> 00:05:25.596
after 10 rainy seasons,

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.060
and as much as I grew a bit older,

00:05:28.084 --> 00:05:29.806
the wall got some wrinkles as well.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.997
The edges my not be as sharp as before,

00:05:32.021 --> 00:05:34.173
but it still looks pretty good,

00:05:34.197 --> 00:05:35.927
and if it needs repairing,

00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:37.942
it is really easy to do.

00:05:37.966 --> 00:05:39.709
You just take the broken part,

00:05:39.733 --> 00:05:42.471
make it wet, and put it back on the wall,

00:05:42.495 --> 00:05:44.518
and it will look the same as before.

00:05:44.542 --> 00:05:46.085
Wish that would work on me, too.

00:05:46.109 --> 00:05:49.410
(Laughter)

00:05:50.685 --> 00:05:52.841
Yeah, and the great thing is,

00:05:52.865 --> 00:05:55.286
if an earth wall is not needed anymore,

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.551
it can go back to the ground it came from,

00:05:58.575 --> 00:06:00.483
turn into a garden,

00:06:00.507 --> 00:06:04.030
or get fully recycled
without any loss of quality.

00:06:04.607 --> 00:06:06.698
There's no other material
that can do this,

00:06:06.722 --> 00:06:11.047
and this is why mud is so excellent
in terms of environmental performance.

00:06:12.421 --> 00:06:14.556
What about the economic sustainability?

00:06:15.252 --> 00:06:16.518
When we built the school,

00:06:16.542 --> 00:06:18.919
I practically lived
on the construction site,

00:06:18.943 --> 00:06:21.967
and in the evening, I used to go
with the workers to the market,

00:06:21.991 --> 00:06:24.067
and I could see
how they spent their money.

00:06:24.984 --> 00:06:28.284
And they would buy
the vegetables from their neighbors,

00:06:28.308 --> 00:06:31.593
they would get a new haircut
or a new blouse from the tailor.

00:06:32.858 --> 00:06:36.716
And because the main part
of the building budget

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.885
was spent on craftsmanship,

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:41.341
the school wasn't just a building,

00:06:41.365 --> 00:06:45.529
it became a real catalyst
for local development,

00:06:45.553 --> 00:06:47.053
and that made me happy.

00:06:48.989 --> 00:06:51.387
If I had designed the school
in cement and steel,

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:55.014
this money would have been exported
and lost for those families.

00:06:56.514 --> 00:07:00.688
(Applause)

00:07:01.935 --> 00:07:05.506
The building budget at that time
was 35,000 euros --

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.491
it's probably doubled by now --

00:07:07.515 --> 00:07:10.603
and this is a lot of money
for that region,

00:07:10.627 --> 00:07:14.632
and especially because this money
is working within the community

00:07:14.656 --> 00:07:15.934
and rotating fast,

00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.640
and not on the stock market.

00:07:18.402 --> 00:07:23.259
So when it comes to the economic
sustainability of my project,

00:07:23.283 --> 00:07:26.529
my main question is, who gets the profit?

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:30.966
How many of you in here

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.172
have some experience
living in a mud house?

00:07:33.514 --> 00:07:35.551
Chris Anderson, where is your hand?

00:07:35.575 --> 00:07:36.632
(Laughter)

00:07:36.656 --> 00:07:37.830
You? OK.

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:40.290
Yeah.

00:07:40.314 --> 00:07:43.479
It seems totally out of our focus,

00:07:43.503 --> 00:07:48.137
but approximately three billion people
all around the planet

00:07:48.161 --> 00:07:50.644
are living in earth houses,

00:07:50.668 --> 00:07:52.954
and it is a traditional building material

00:07:52.978 --> 00:07:55.691
in Europe just as much as in Africa.

00:07:58.076 --> 00:07:59.617
Strangely enough,

00:07:59.641 --> 00:08:03.306
mud is not considered worthy
of being studied at universities ...

00:08:04.281 --> 00:08:07.479
so I brought the dirt to Harvard,

00:08:07.503 --> 00:08:09.710
(Laughter)

00:08:09.734 --> 00:08:13.710
precisely 60 tons of dirt
right in front of the main facade

00:08:13.734 --> 00:08:15.336
of the Graduate School of Design.

00:08:17.478 --> 00:08:19.622
Students and faculty
rolled up their sleeves,

00:08:19.646 --> 00:08:20.801
got their hands dirty

00:08:20.825 --> 00:08:24.224
and transformed the front
into a warm place for people to gather.

00:08:25.248 --> 00:08:26.964
Children would climb the structures,

00:08:26.988 --> 00:08:28.505
skaters would ride the ramp,

00:08:28.529 --> 00:08:30.275
students having lunch breaks,

00:08:30.299 --> 00:08:34.371
and it was particularly fascinating to see
how many people were touching the wall,

00:08:34.395 --> 00:08:38.248
and we usually don't go around cities
caressing our facades, right?

00:08:38.272 --> 00:08:40.133
(Laughter)

00:08:44.366 --> 00:08:47.013
(Laughter)

00:08:48.603 --> 00:08:50.610
Of course, this was a small-scale project,

00:08:50.634 --> 00:08:53.730
but in terms of awareness-building
and in terms of education,

00:08:53.754 --> 00:08:56.284
it was like an acupuncture trigger point.

00:08:57.701 --> 00:09:01.281
And in fact, in more and more countries,

00:09:01.305 --> 00:09:06.290
load-bearing earthen structures
are not allowed to be built anymore

00:09:06.314 --> 00:09:09.816
although they're traditional
and have lasted for hundreds of years,

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.856
and not because the material is weak,

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.032
but because there are
no architects and engineers

00:09:15.056 --> 00:09:17.492
who know how to deal with that material.

00:09:17.516 --> 00:09:19.190
So education on all levels,

00:09:19.214 --> 00:09:21.890
for craftsmen, engineers and architects,

00:09:21.914 --> 00:09:23.681
is really strongly needed.

00:09:24.085 --> 00:09:27.429
Equally important
is technological development,

00:09:27.453 --> 00:09:30.546
like prefabrication developed
by my colleague Martin Rauch,

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:34.556
who is an Austrian artist
and expert in earthen structures.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.190
And he has created technologies
for rammed earth elements,

00:09:38.214 --> 00:09:40.647
for prefabrication
of rammed earth elements

00:09:40.671 --> 00:09:44.432
that include insulation,
wall heatings and coolings

00:09:44.456 --> 00:09:46.257
and all sorts of electrical fittings

00:09:46.281 --> 00:09:48.574
that can be layered
to multistoried buildings,

00:09:48.598 --> 00:09:51.275
and this is important in order to scale up

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:53.267
and in order to [speed] up the processes,

00:09:53.291 --> 00:09:56.591
like in the Ricola Herb Center
in Switzerland.

00:09:58.555 --> 00:10:01.683
And finally, we need good built projects

00:10:01.707 --> 00:10:04.802
that prove you can build
with an ancient material

00:10:04.826 --> 00:10:06.694
in a very modern way.

00:10:07.434 --> 00:10:11.128
It is not a matter
of how old a material is;

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:14.633
it's a matter of our creative
ability to use it today.

00:10:16.936 --> 00:10:19.191
These, for example, are three hostels

00:10:19.215 --> 00:10:21.562
that I did in China in the village Baoxi,

00:10:21.586 --> 00:10:24.372
about six hours by bus from Shanghai.

00:10:25.859 --> 00:10:28.550
The outside shape is woven bamboo,

00:10:28.574 --> 00:10:32.137
and the inside core
is stones and rammed earth.

00:10:33.058 --> 00:10:35.514
And it is a traditional building material.

00:10:35.538 --> 00:10:37.731
Even large parts
of the Great Wall of China

00:10:37.755 --> 00:10:39.400
have been built with rammed earth,

00:10:39.424 --> 00:10:41.717
but it's getting replaced by concrete.

00:10:42.411 --> 00:10:45.885
And this trend is happening very fast.

00:10:45.909 --> 00:10:48.885
Within only a couple of years,

00:10:48.909 --> 00:10:51.902
China has consumed more cement
than the United States

00:10:51.926 --> 00:10:54.162
in the entire 20th century.

00:10:54.618 --> 00:10:58.127
And this trend of replacing
natural building materials

00:10:58.151 --> 00:11:00.404
with materials that require
a lot of energy,

00:11:00.428 --> 00:11:02.214
that are energy-intensive,

00:11:02.238 --> 00:11:04.279
and that emit CO2

00:11:04.303 --> 00:11:07.643
is really clearly contributing
to climate change.

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.080
And we have alternatives,

00:11:09.104 --> 00:11:13.355
such as mud, stones, timber,
bamboo, earth,

00:11:13.379 --> 00:11:17.267
that are totally effective options
for all sorts of purposes.

00:11:17.926 --> 00:11:20.473
This, for example,
is an office building that we did

00:11:20.497 --> 00:11:22.878
for Omicron Electronics in Austria.

00:11:22.902 --> 00:11:25.799
Mud is healthy for the planet,
but also for the human bodies,

00:11:25.823 --> 00:11:28.465
and the material is low-tech,

00:11:28.489 --> 00:11:30.712
but the performance is high-tech.

00:11:30.736 --> 00:11:34.815
The earth walls keep the highly
sophisticated tools in the building safe

00:11:34.839 --> 00:11:36.750
by naturally regulating moisture.

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:41.102
And this wall in my own home

00:11:41.126 --> 00:11:42.554
is our humidfier.

00:11:44.372 --> 00:11:47.302
We love our six tons of dirt at home

00:11:47.326 --> 00:11:49.816
not only because
it's healthy and sustainable.

00:11:50.397 --> 00:11:53.453
Its archaic warmth
is touching deep within.

00:11:54.708 --> 00:11:59.430
My personal dream is to build
a mud skyscraper right in Manhattan.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.859
(Laughter)

00:12:01.883 --> 00:12:03.034
Yeah.

00:12:03.058 --> 00:12:05.257
(Applause)

00:12:05.281 --> 00:12:06.830
And this dream isn't so crazy

00:12:06.854 --> 00:12:09.046
if you think of the mud city
of Shibam in Yemen

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.935
that was built in the 16th century

00:12:10.959 --> 00:12:14.227
and has lasted now for 500 years.

00:12:15.267 --> 00:12:19.374
What was possible that long ago
is possible today as well,

00:12:19.398 --> 00:12:23.002
and we can apply
all our technical know-how

00:12:23.026 --> 00:12:25.036
to these ancient materials

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:28.662
so that it meets our needs and our dreams.

00:12:30.403 --> 00:12:32.277
All around us,

00:12:32.301 --> 00:12:34.053
and just below our feet ...

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.827
are wonderful natural building materials.

00:12:37.851 --> 00:12:39.226
Let's use them.

00:12:40.221 --> 00:12:42.137
And I deeply believe

00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:44.914
our homes, our work spaces, our cities

00:12:45.716 --> 00:12:48.295
would become more healthy and sustainable

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:50.762
and more humane

00:12:52.087 --> 00:12:53.293
and beautiful.

00:12:53.932 --> 00:12:55.083
Thank you.

00:12:55.107 --> 00:13:00.150
(Applause)
