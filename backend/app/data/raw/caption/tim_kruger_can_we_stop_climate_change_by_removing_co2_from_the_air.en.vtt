00:00:12.934 --> 00:00:15.032
To avoid dangerous climate change,

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:17.595
we're going to need
to cut emissions rapidly.

00:00:18.413 --> 00:00:21.497
That should be a pretty
uncontentious statement,

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:23.377
certainly with this audience.

00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:26.325
But here's something
that's slightly more contentious:

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.405
it's not going to be enough.

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:33.330
We will munch our way through
our remaining carbon budget

00:00:33.354 --> 00:00:34.919
for one and a half degrees

00:00:34.943 --> 00:00:37.328
in a few short years,

00:00:37.352 --> 00:00:38.974
and the two degree budget

00:00:38.998 --> 00:00:40.597
in about two decades.

00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:45.334
We need to not only cut emissions
extremely rapidly,

00:00:45.358 --> 00:00:49.489
we also need to take carbon dioxide
out of the atmosphere.

00:00:50.882 --> 00:00:52.038
Thank you.

00:00:52.062 --> 00:00:53.654
(Laughter)

00:00:53.678 --> 00:00:58.423
I work assessing a whole range
of these proposed techniques

00:00:58.447 --> 00:00:59.920
to see if they can work.

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:03.986
We could use plants to take CO2 out,

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.254
and then store it in trees,

00:01:06.278 --> 00:01:09.833
in the soil, deep underground
or in the oceans.

00:01:09.857 --> 00:01:14.181
We could build large machines,
so-called artificial trees,

00:01:14.205 --> 00:01:16.330
that will scrub CO2 from the air.

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:18.930
For these ideas to be feasible,

00:01:18.954 --> 00:01:21.797
we need to understand
whether they can be applied

00:01:21.821 --> 00:01:26.872
at a vast scale in a way that is safe,
economic and socially acceptable.

00:01:27.878 --> 00:01:30.052
All of these ideas come with tradeoffs.

00:01:30.576 --> 00:01:32.429
None of them are perfect,

00:01:32.453 --> 00:01:34.080
but many have potential.

00:01:35.187 --> 00:01:38.659
It's unlikely that any one of them
will solve it on its own.

00:01:38.683 --> 00:01:40.021
There is no silver bullet,

00:01:40.045 --> 00:01:43.731
but potentially together,
they may form the silver buckshot

00:01:43.755 --> 00:01:47.655
that we need to stop
climate change in its tracks.

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.086
I'm working independently
on one particular idea

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.592
which uses natural gas
to generate electricity

00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:58.571
in a way that takes
carbon dioxide out of the air.

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:00.649
Huh? How does that work?

00:02:01.345 --> 00:02:06.026
So the Origen Power Process
feeds natural gas into a fuel cell.

00:02:06.441 --> 00:02:10.342
About half the chemical energy
is converted into electricity,

00:02:10.366 --> 00:02:12.405
and the remainder into heat,

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:15.071
which is used to break down limestone

00:02:15.095 --> 00:02:17.110
into lime and carbon dioxide.

00:02:17.697 --> 00:02:21.069
Now at this point, you're probably
thinking that I'm nuts.

00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:23.966
It's actually generating carbon dioxide.

00:02:24.488 --> 00:02:28.203
But the key point is,
all of the carbon dioxide generated,

00:02:28.227 --> 00:02:31.886
both from the fuel cell
and from the lime kiln, is pure,

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.251
and that's really important,

00:02:33.275 --> 00:02:35.864
because it means you can
either use that carbon dioxide

00:02:35.888 --> 00:02:39.649
or you can store it away
deep underground at low cost.

00:02:40.488 --> 00:02:45.709
And then the lime that you produce
can be used in industrial processes,

00:02:45.733 --> 00:02:49.289
and in being used,
it scrubs CO2 out of the air.

00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:52.802
Overall, the process is carbon negative.

00:02:52.826 --> 00:02:55.182
It removes carbon dioxide from the air.

00:02:56.423 --> 00:03:01.049
If you normally generate
electricity from natural gas,

00:03:01.073 --> 00:03:04.878
you emit about 400 grams
of CO2 into the air

00:03:04.902 --> 00:03:06.411
for every kilowatt-hour.

00:03:07.127 --> 00:03:12.175
With this process,
that figure is minus 600.

00:03:13.157 --> 00:03:15.878
At the moment, power
generation is responsible

00:03:15.902 --> 00:03:19.825
for about a quarter
of all carbon dioxide emissions.

00:03:20.643 --> 00:03:25.606
Hypothetically, if you replaced
all power generation with this process,

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.570
then you would not only eliminate all
of the emissions from power generation

00:03:29.594 --> 00:03:33.644
but you would start removing emissions
from other sectors as well,

00:03:33.668 --> 00:03:37.860
potentially cutting 60 percent
of overall carbon emissions.

00:03:38.682 --> 00:03:41.228
You could even use the lime

00:03:41.252 --> 00:03:46.552
to add it directly to seawater
to counteract ocean acidification,

00:03:46.576 --> 00:03:50.628
one of the other issues that is caused
by CO2 in the atmosphere.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.479
In fact, you get more bang for your buck.

00:03:54.503 --> 00:03:58.778
You absorb about twice as much
carbon dioxide when you add it to seawater

00:03:58.802 --> 00:04:00.464
as when you use it industrially.

00:04:01.118 --> 00:04:03.362
But this is where it gets
really complicated.

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:08.134
While counteracting ocean
acidification is a good thing,

00:04:08.158 --> 00:04:12.039
we don't fully understand
what the environmental consequences are,

00:04:12.063 --> 00:04:15.293
and so we need to assess
whether this treatment

00:04:15.317 --> 00:04:18.841
is actually better than the disease
that it is seeking to cure.

00:04:18.865 --> 00:04:22.103
We need to put in place
step-by-step governance

00:04:22.127 --> 00:04:24.317
for experiments to assess this safely.

00:04:25.375 --> 00:04:26.557
And the scale:

00:04:28.214 --> 00:04:29.844
to avoid dangerous climate change,

00:04:29.868 --> 00:04:32.947
we are going to need
to remove trillions --

00:04:32.971 --> 00:04:34.760
and yes, that's trillions with a T --

00:04:34.784 --> 00:04:39.947
trillions of tons of carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere in the decades ahead.

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:45.934
It will cost a few percent of GDP --
think defense-sized expenditure,

00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.924
lots of industrial activity

00:04:47.948 --> 00:04:50.631
and inevitably harmful side effects.

00:04:51.085 --> 00:04:53.152
But if the scale seems enormous,

00:04:53.176 --> 00:04:55.702
it is only because
of the scale of the problem

00:04:55.726 --> 00:04:57.854
that we are seeking to solve.

00:04:57.878 --> 00:04:59.391
It's enormous as well.

00:05:00.923 --> 00:05:03.939
We can no longer avoid
these thorny issues.

00:05:03.963 --> 00:05:06.535
We face risks whichever way we turn:

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:08.506
a world changed by climate change

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.947
or a world changed by climate change
and our efforts to counter climate change.

00:05:14.656 --> 00:05:15.988
Would that it were not so,

00:05:16.012 --> 00:05:19.961
but we can no longer afford
to close our eyes, block our ears,

00:05:19.985 --> 00:05:21.554
and say la-la-la.

00:05:21.578 --> 00:05:25.360
We need to grow up and face
the consequences of our actions.

00:05:25.756 --> 00:05:30.877
(Applause)

00:05:30.901 --> 00:05:36.399
Does talk of curing climate change
undermine the will to cut emissions?

00:05:37.077 --> 00:05:38.914
This is a real concern,

00:05:38.938 --> 00:05:43.786
so we need to emphasize the paramount
importance of reducing emissions

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.316
and how speculative these ideas are.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.695
But having done so,
we still need to examine them.

00:05:50.161 --> 00:05:51.986
Can we cure climate change?

00:05:52.706 --> 00:05:56.044
I don't know, but we certainly
can't if we don't try.

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:59.437
We need ambition without arrogance.

00:05:59.917 --> 00:06:03.188
We need the ambition
to restore the atmosphere,

00:06:03.212 --> 00:06:05.030
to draw down carbon dioxide

00:06:05.054 --> 00:06:09.761
back to a level that is compatible
with a stable climate and healthy oceans.

00:06:10.257 --> 00:06:12.751
This will be an enormous undertaking.

00:06:12.775 --> 00:06:16.121
You could describe it
as a cathedral project.

00:06:16.145 --> 00:06:18.127
Those involved at the outset

00:06:18.151 --> 00:06:21.507
may draft the plans
and dig the foundations,

00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:24.394
but they will not raise the spire
to its full height.

00:06:24.418 --> 00:06:26.377
That task, that privilege,

00:06:26.401 --> 00:06:28.261
belongs to our descendants.

00:06:28.801 --> 00:06:32.221
None of us will see that day,
but we must start in the hope

00:06:32.245 --> 00:06:35.122
that future generations
will be able to finish the job.

00:06:36.442 --> 00:06:39.090
So, do you want to change the world?

00:06:40.114 --> 00:06:41.264
I don't.

00:06:41.904 --> 00:06:44.133
I do not seek the change the world,

00:06:44.157 --> 00:06:46.592
but rather keep it as it's meant to be.

00:06:47.641 --> 00:06:48.792
Thank you.

00:06:48.816 --> 00:06:54.072
(Applause)

00:06:54.096 --> 00:06:57.678
Chris Anderson: Thanks. I just want
to ask you a couple of other questions.

00:06:57.702 --> 00:07:01.141
Tell us a bit more about this idea
of putting lime in the ocean.

00:07:01.165 --> 00:07:03.672
I mean, on the face of it,
it's pretty compelling --

00:07:03.696 --> 00:07:05.890
anti-ocean acidification --

00:07:05.914 --> 00:07:08.549
and it absorbs more CO2.

00:07:08.573 --> 00:07:11.115
You talked about,
we need to do an experiment on this.

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:13.352
What would a responsible
experiment look like?

00:07:13.376 --> 00:07:16.338
Tim Kruger: So I think you need to do
a series of experiments,

00:07:16.362 --> 00:07:18.964
but you need to do them
just very small stage-by-stage.

00:07:18.988 --> 00:07:21.274
In the same way,
when you're trialing a new drug,

00:07:21.298 --> 00:07:23.784
you wouldn't just go
into human trials straight off.

00:07:23.808 --> 00:07:25.756
You would do a small experiment.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.372
And so the first things to do
are experiments entirely on land,

00:07:29.396 --> 00:07:32.978
in special containers,
away from the environment.

00:07:33.002 --> 00:07:36.481
And then once you are confident
that that can be done safely,

00:07:36.505 --> 00:07:37.836
you move to the next stage.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.532
If you're not confident, you don't.

00:07:39.556 --> 00:07:40.706
But step by step.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.614
CA: And who would fund such experiments?

00:07:43.638 --> 00:07:47.513
Because they kind of impact
the whole planet at some level.

00:07:47.537 --> 00:07:50.063
Is that why nothing is happening on this?

00:07:50.087 --> 00:07:53.908
TK: So I think you can do small-scale
experiments in national waters,

00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:58.977
and then it's probably the requirement
of national funders to do that.

00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:04.053
But ultimately, if you wanted
to counter ocean acidification in this way

00:08:04.077 --> 00:08:05.548
on a global scale,

00:08:05.572 --> 00:08:07.826
you would need to do it
in international waters,

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:11.570
and then you would need to have
an international community working on it.

00:08:11.594 --> 00:08:14.647
CA: Even in national waters,
you know, the ocean's all connected.

00:08:14.671 --> 00:08:16.388
That lime is going to get out there.

00:08:16.412 --> 00:08:19.384
And people feel outraged
about doing experiments on the planet,

00:08:19.408 --> 00:08:20.797
as we've heard.

00:08:21.385 --> 00:08:23.048
How do you counter that?

00:08:23.072 --> 00:08:26.051
TK: I think you touch on something
which is really important.

00:08:26.075 --> 00:08:28.491
It's about a social license to operate.

00:08:28.515 --> 00:08:32.251
And I think it may be
that it is impossible to do,

00:08:32.275 --> 00:08:34.715
but we need to have the courage to try,

00:08:34.739 --> 00:08:36.029
to move this forward,

00:08:36.053 --> 00:08:37.387
to see what we can do,

00:08:37.411 --> 00:08:38.776
and to engage openly.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.821
And we need to engage with people
in a transparent way.

00:08:41.845 --> 00:08:43.851
We need to ask them beforehand.

00:08:43.875 --> 00:08:45.624
And I think if we ask them,

00:08:45.648 --> 00:08:49.268
we have to be open to the possibility
that the answer will come back,

00:08:49.292 --> 00:08:50.497
"No, don't do it."

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.198
CA: Thanks so much.
That was really fascinating.

00:08:53.222 --> 00:08:55.301
TK: Thank you. (Applause)
