00:00:12.906 --> 00:00:15.985
My story starts in the northern
Galapagos Islands,

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.414
under 50 feet of water
and a big school of sharks.

00:00:20.148 --> 00:00:23.119
I'd been scuba diving with a group
of friends for about a week,

00:00:23.143 --> 00:00:24.472
and it had been glorious:

00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:27.124
manta rays, whale sharks,

00:00:27.148 --> 00:00:29.898
penguins and, of course,
hammerhead sharks.

00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:34.077
Today's dive was particularly tricky.

00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:35.332
The surge was terrible.

00:00:35.356 --> 00:00:37.546
You had to have your camera rig tight in

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.722
and your arm out,

00:00:38.746 --> 00:00:41.104
because the surge kept
throwing you into the rocks

00:00:41.128 --> 00:00:43.748
while you're scanning up
for that beautiful photograph.

00:00:43.772 --> 00:00:46.302
It was going OK, until ...

00:00:46.326 --> 00:00:47.891
not OK.

00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:51.017
Something was terribly, terribly wrong.

00:00:51.552 --> 00:00:53.388
I pulled my hand back,

00:00:53.412 --> 00:00:56.054
and I had long, black sea urchin spines

00:00:56.078 --> 00:00:57.678
all the way through my gloves,

00:00:57.702 --> 00:00:59.801
which meant all the way through my hand.

00:01:00.344 --> 00:01:02.356
Now, this is bad.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.865
I mean, obviously when you have something
all the way through your hand,

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:07.103
it's kind of bad anyway,

00:01:07.127 --> 00:01:11.307
but in this case, sea urchins
have a venom on them that,

00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:12.924
if you've ever tangled with them,

00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:17.595
you know that a sea urchin spine in you
gives you horrible, painful inflammation.

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.316
But that wasn't even topmost
in my mind at this point.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.491
This did not look real.

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:24.979
I could not believe that this was my hand.

00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:29.762
Now, in a crisis, I tend to disassociate
into, like, little scientists,

00:01:29.786 --> 00:01:32.903
and I start talking very analytically.

00:01:32.927 --> 00:01:35.906
All analysis was gone,
adrenaline brain kicked in,

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.769
and I just yanked the spines out.

00:01:38.793 --> 00:01:40.932
I don't remember doing it.

00:01:41.665 --> 00:01:45.522
I just remember thinking, "I can't
get my glove off with these in here."

00:01:45.546 --> 00:01:47.642
I do remember taking the glove off

00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:51.320
and a big plume of black
coming up in front of my face.

00:01:51.875 --> 00:01:56.303
And biologist brain now shows up
and starts freaking out.

00:01:56.327 --> 00:01:59.496
"How could all that toxin
have gotten into that wound already?"

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.641
Well, physicist brain then shows up
and very calmly explains,

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:05.363
"No, no, no, we're at 50 feet,

00:02:05.387 --> 00:02:06.864
red wavelengths are attenuated.

00:02:06.888 --> 00:02:08.819
That's blood -- not black.

00:02:10.566 --> 00:02:11.954
And sharks.

00:02:12.793 --> 00:02:14.392
So what are you gonna do?"

00:02:14.965 --> 00:02:19.531
Well, I cranked my cummerbund
down really hard over my hand,

00:02:19.555 --> 00:02:22.308
and I simply swam away.

00:02:23.078 --> 00:02:28.392
"Let's let that big old cloud of blood
dissipate a bit before we have to surface

00:02:28.416 --> 00:02:30.224
through all of these sharks."

00:02:30.248 --> 00:02:31.715
So when I did surface,

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.640
my warm-blooded-mammal brain

00:02:33.664 --> 00:02:35.716
was in an absolute gibbering panic:

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.868
"They don't feed when they're schooling.
They don't feed when they're schooling.

00:02:39.892 --> 00:02:41.219
All the way up."

00:02:41.243 --> 00:02:42.427
And they didn't.

00:02:42.451 --> 00:02:45.667
So apparently, they have read
the same books that I have.

00:02:45.691 --> 00:02:47.083
(Laughter)

00:02:47.107 --> 00:02:48.535
Now, it turns out,

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:50.871
when you've been stabbed
with sea urchin spines,

00:02:50.895 --> 00:02:53.573
and you're two days away
from any medical help,

00:02:53.597 --> 00:02:57.820
the thing that you've got to do
is, unfortunately, cook your hand.

00:02:58.621 --> 00:03:01.265
So you put it in water
as hot as you can stand,

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:02.924
and you keep adding boiling water

00:03:02.948 --> 00:03:06.262
until you think you will go
absolutely insane.

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:07.697
Now, it worked --

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:12.386
the hand itself did not work so well
for several weeks after that,

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.548
but eventually,
fine motor skills returned.

00:03:15.572 --> 00:03:20.166
All except for one spot, that stayed
stiff and painful for weeks

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.392
after the other things had gotten better.

00:03:22.416 --> 00:03:26.660
So it turned out, I'd broken off
a tip of the urchin spine

00:03:26.684 --> 00:03:28.787
in the joint itself,

00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:30.761
and that's why it wasn't getting better.

00:03:30.785 --> 00:03:33.744
So the orthopedist says,
"You know, we should get this out.

00:03:33.768 --> 00:03:36.414
Nothing too urgent, not an emergency."

00:03:36.438 --> 00:03:39.841
So we scheduled a small surgery
for a few weeks out on a Monday.

00:03:40.476 --> 00:03:42.928
And on the Friday before,

00:03:42.952 --> 00:03:46.020
I broke my pelvis
in a horseback riding accident.

00:03:46.044 --> 00:03:47.743
(Laughter)

00:03:47.767 --> 00:03:48.976
Yeah.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.611
So we kind of postponed that surgery.

00:03:52.461 --> 00:03:57.018
My broken pelvis and I were now
facing six weeks on the couch,

00:03:57.042 --> 00:04:02.146
and I would have gone absolutely insane
if it hadn't been for my friends.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.629
Spontaneous parties broke out
at my house every night for weeks.

00:04:05.653 --> 00:04:07.929
I was fed. I was entertained.

00:04:07.953 --> 00:04:09.278
It was great.

00:04:10.015 --> 00:04:13.936
But that kind of enthusiasm is sort of
hard to sustain over the long term,

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.256
and eventually it petered down
to just one friend,

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.272
who would send me jokes during the day

00:04:19.296 --> 00:04:21.900
and come and keep me company
in the evenings --

00:04:21.924 --> 00:04:26.290
someone I got to know a whole lot better
during this period of convalescence.

00:04:26.314 --> 00:04:28.430
And when I was finally
pronounced well enough

00:04:28.454 --> 00:04:30.144
to do weight-bearing activities,

00:04:30.168 --> 00:04:33.207
we loaded a telescope in the car
and drove up into the mountains

00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:35.347
to look at the Haleâ€“Bopp comet.

00:04:35.371 --> 00:04:37.465
Yes, we are geeks.

00:04:37.489 --> 00:04:39.189
And got caught in a landslide.

00:04:39.213 --> 00:04:41.158
(Laughter)

00:04:41.182 --> 00:04:43.446
I know -- like, really?

00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:45.513
No. Just kidding.

00:04:45.537 --> 00:04:46.719
(Laughter)

00:04:46.743 --> 00:04:49.675
No more disasters. No.
Just the opposite, in fact.

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.239
That was 21 years ago,

00:04:51.263 --> 00:04:53.150
and for 19 of those years,

00:04:53.174 --> 00:04:56.774
I have been married
to that marvelous introvert

00:04:56.798 --> 00:04:59.310
who never in a million years
would have approached me

00:04:59.334 --> 00:05:01.025
under other circumstances.

00:05:01.049 --> 00:05:03.109
We have a wonderful 14-year-old daughter,

00:05:03.133 --> 00:05:04.740
who did all my illustrations.

00:05:04.764 --> 00:05:06.340
(Cheers and applause)

00:05:06.364 --> 00:05:07.526
Yeah.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.888
So, pro tip:

00:05:08.912 --> 00:05:11.696
apparently, nothing makes you sexier
than needing a walker

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.955
on your first date.

00:05:13.393 --> 00:05:16.006
So this isn't a story about piercings

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.815
or sharks or boilings or breakings.

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:20.273
It's a love story.

00:05:20.758 --> 00:05:23.646
It's a love story with
a funny little epilogue.

00:05:24.845 --> 00:05:28.875
Now I was weight-bearing again,
I could reschedule that surgery,

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:30.195
get the spine out.

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:31.756
But I didn't need it anymore.

00:05:32.407 --> 00:05:34.107
Turns out, when you break a bone,

00:05:34.131 --> 00:05:38.057
your body scavenges calcium
from all the bones in your body --

00:05:38.081 --> 00:05:41.970
and from the little sea urchin spine
that you happen to have lodged

00:05:41.994 --> 00:05:43.998
in the joint of your finger.

00:05:44.022 --> 00:05:45.285
So yes,

00:05:46.094 --> 00:05:49.482
my pelvis is now part sea urchin.

00:05:49.506 --> 00:05:51.331
(Laughter)

00:05:51.355 --> 00:05:54.445
So to biology brain, physicist brain,

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:56.616
adrenaline brain,
warm-blooded-mammal brain,

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.648
I get to add "urchin brain,"

00:05:58.672 --> 00:06:01.974
with all of the superpowers
that that confers.

00:06:02.393 --> 00:06:03.929
You don't need to worry, though:

00:06:03.953 --> 00:06:06.112
that I am not fully human
is one of the things

00:06:06.136 --> 00:06:08.129
that my family loves the most about me.

00:06:08.153 --> 00:06:09.240
(Laughter)

00:06:09.264 --> 00:06:10.459
Thank you very much.

00:06:10.483 --> 00:06:14.656
(Applause)
