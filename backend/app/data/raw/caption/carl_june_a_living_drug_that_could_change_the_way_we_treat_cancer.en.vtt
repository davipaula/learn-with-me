00:00:12.952 --> 00:00:15.858
So this is the first time
I've told this story in public,

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:17.793
the personal aspects of it.

00:00:19.056 --> 00:00:24.133
Yogi Berra was a world-famous
baseball player who said,

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:26.479
"If you come to a fork
in the road, take it."

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.568
Researchers had been,
for more than a century,

00:00:30.592 --> 00:00:33.334
studying the immune system
as a way to fight cancer,

00:00:34.482 --> 00:00:37.942
and cancer vaccines have,
unfortunately, been disappointing.

00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:40.776
They've only worked in cancers
caused by viruses,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.017
like cervical cancer or liver cancer.

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.939
So cancer researchers basically
gave up on the idea

00:00:47.963 --> 00:00:50.819
of using the immune system
to fight cancer.

00:00:52.127 --> 00:00:56.123
And the immune system, in any case,
did not evolve to fight cancer;

00:00:56.147 --> 00:00:59.529
it evolved to fight pathogens
invading from the outside.

00:00:59.962 --> 00:01:02.881
So its job is to kill
bacteria and viruses.

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:06.823
And the reason the immune system
has trouble with most cancers

00:01:06.847 --> 00:01:10.291
is that it doesn't invade
from the outside;

00:01:10.315 --> 00:01:13.319
it evolves from its own cells.

00:01:14.337 --> 00:01:18.544
And so either the immune system does
not recognize the cancer as a problem,

00:01:18.568 --> 00:01:21.853
or it attacks a cancer
and also our normal cells,

00:01:21.877 --> 00:01:26.437
leading to autoimmune diseases
like colitis or multiple sclerosis.

00:01:26.991 --> 00:01:28.790
So how do you get around that?

00:01:28.814 --> 00:01:33.648
Our answer turned out to be
synthetic immune systems

00:01:33.672 --> 00:01:36.847
that are designed to recognize
and kill cancer cells.

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:41.009
That's right -- I said
a synthetic immune system.

00:01:42.978 --> 00:01:47.168
You do that with genetic engineering
and synthetic biology.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.932
We did it with the naturally occurring
parts of the immune system,

00:01:50.956 --> 00:01:52.886
called B cells and T cells.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.177
These were our building blocks.

00:01:55.522 --> 00:01:59.196
T cells have evolved to kill
cells infected with viruses,

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.359
and B cells are the cells that make
antibodies that are secreted

00:02:03.383 --> 00:02:05.978
and then bind to kill bacteria.

00:02:07.012 --> 00:02:11.355
Well, what if you combined
these two functions

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.450
in a way that was designed
to repurpose them to fight cancer?

00:02:15.474 --> 00:02:19.101
We realized it would be possible
to insert the genes for antibodies

00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:21.306
from B cells into T cells.

00:02:21.854 --> 00:02:23.322
So how do you do that?

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:28.155
Well, we used an HIV virus
as a Trojan horse

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:30.999
to get past the T cells' immune system.

00:02:32.464 --> 00:02:34.051
The result is a chimera,

00:02:34.075 --> 00:02:38.188
a fantastic fire-breathing creature
from Greek mythology,

00:02:38.212 --> 00:02:41.902
with a lion's head, a goat's body
and a serpent's tail.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.379
So we decided that the paradoxical
thing that we had created

00:02:46.403 --> 00:02:50.596
with our B-cell antibodies,
our T cells carrier

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.688
and the HIV Trojan horse

00:02:52.712 --> 00:02:57.577
should be called "Chimeric Antigen
Receptor T cells," or CAR T cells.

00:02:58.538 --> 00:03:01.521
The virus also inserts genetic information

00:03:01.545 --> 00:03:05.277
to activate the T cells and program them
into their killing mode.

00:03:05.915 --> 00:03:09.994
So when CAR T cells are injected
into somebody with cancer,

00:03:10.018 --> 00:03:14.356
what happens when those CAR T cells
see and bind to their tumor target?

00:03:14.688 --> 00:03:18.394
They act like supercharged killer
T cells on steroids.

00:03:19.197 --> 00:03:22.593
They start this crash-defense
buildup system in the body

00:03:22.617 --> 00:03:25.677
and literally divide
and multiply by the millions,

00:03:25.701 --> 00:03:27.996
where they then attack and kill the tumor.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.605
All of this means that CAR T cells
are the first living drug in medicine.

00:03:34.375 --> 00:03:35.839
CAR T cells break the mold.

00:03:35.863 --> 00:03:38.117
Unlike normal drugs that you take --

00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:42.315
they do their job and get metabolized,
and then you have to take them again --

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:46.043
CAR T cells stay alive
and on the job for years.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.089
We have had CAR T cells stay
in the bodies of our cancer patients

00:03:51.113 --> 00:03:52.990
now for more than eight years.

00:03:54.196 --> 00:03:57.434
And these designer
cancer T cells, CAR T cells,

00:03:57.458 --> 00:04:01.426
have a calculated half-life
of more than 17 years.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.398
So one infusion can do the job;

00:04:03.422 --> 00:04:05.925
they stay on patrol
for the rest of your life.

00:04:06.403 --> 00:04:09.147
This is the beginning
of a new paradigm in medicine.

00:04:10.173 --> 00:04:14.817
Now, there was one major challenge
to these T-cell infusions.

00:04:15.903 --> 00:04:20.170
The only source of T cells
that will work in a patient

00:04:20.194 --> 00:04:21.361
are your own T cells,

00:04:21.385 --> 00:04:23.673
unless you happen to have
an identical twin.

00:04:24.234 --> 00:04:26.397
So for most of us, we're out of luck.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.285
So what we did was to make CAR T cells.

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:35.357
We had to learn to grow
the patient's own T cells.

00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:39.364
And we developed a robust
platform for this in the 1990s.

00:04:39.831 --> 00:04:43.863
Then in 1997, we first tested
CAR T cells in patients

00:04:43.887 --> 00:04:45.736
with advanced HIV-AIDS.

00:04:46.268 --> 00:04:49.366
And we found that those CAR T cells
survived in the patients

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.974
for more than a decade.

00:04:50.998 --> 00:04:54.013
And it improved their immune system
and decreased their viruses,

00:04:54.037 --> 00:04:55.403
but it didn't cure them.

00:04:55.427 --> 00:04:58.268
So we went back to the laboratory,
and over the next decade

00:04:58.292 --> 00:05:01.149
made improvements
to the CAR T cell design.

00:05:01.173 --> 00:05:05.020
And by 2010, we began treating
leukemia patients.

00:05:05.663 --> 00:05:08.020
And our team treated three patients

00:05:08.044 --> 00:05:11.782
with advanced chronic
lymphocytic leukemia in 2012.

00:05:11.806 --> 00:05:14.474
It's a form of incurable leukemia

00:05:14.498 --> 00:05:18.783
that afflicts approximately 20,000 adults
every year in the United States.

00:05:19.887 --> 00:05:24.921
The first patient that we treated
was a retired Marine sergeant

00:05:24.945 --> 00:05:26.871
and a prison corrections officer.

00:05:26.895 --> 00:05:28.204
He had only weeks to live

00:05:28.228 --> 00:05:32.427
and had, in fact, already paid
for his funeral.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.597
The cells were infused,
and within days, he had high fevers.

00:05:37.621 --> 00:05:39.398
He developed multiple organ failures,

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:41.771
was transferred to the ICU
and was comatose.

00:05:41.795 --> 00:05:43.359
We thought he would die,

00:05:43.383 --> 00:05:45.835
and, in fact, he was given last rites.

00:05:45.859 --> 00:05:50.698
But then, another
fork in the road happened.

00:05:50.722 --> 00:05:53.706
So, around 28 days after
the CAR T cell infusion,

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:54.887
he woke up,

00:05:54.911 --> 00:05:57.165
and the physicians finally examined him,

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:58.457
and the cancer was gone.

00:05:58.481 --> 00:06:00.781
The big masses that
had been there had melted.

00:06:01.823 --> 00:06:04.220
Bone marrow biopsies found
no evidence of leukemia,

00:06:04.244 --> 00:06:07.244
and that year, in our first
three patients we treated,

00:06:07.268 --> 00:06:10.524
two of three have had durable remissions
now for eight years,

00:06:10.548 --> 00:06:12.814
and one had a partial remission.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.530
The CAR T cells had attacked
the leukemia in these patients

00:06:16.554 --> 00:06:23.334
and had dissolved between 2.9
and 7.7 pounds of tumor in each patient.

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:29.482
Their bodies had become veritable
bioreactors for these CAR T cells,

00:06:29.506 --> 00:06:32.363
producing millions
and millions of CAR T cells

00:06:32.387 --> 00:06:36.174
in the bone marrow,
blood and tumor masses.

00:06:36.511 --> 00:06:40.796
And we discovered that these CAR T cells
can punch far above their weight class,

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.376
to use a boxing analogy.

00:06:42.718 --> 00:06:46.877
Just one CAR T cell can kill
1,000 tumor cells.

00:06:47.697 --> 00:06:50.599
That's right -- it's a ratio
of one to a thousand.

00:06:50.623 --> 00:06:53.641
The CAR T cell and
its daughter progeny cells

00:06:53.665 --> 00:06:56.101
can divide and divide
and divide in the body

00:06:56.125 --> 00:06:58.260
until the last tumor cell is gone.

00:06:58.284 --> 00:07:00.833
There's no precedent for this
in cancer medicine.

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:04.559
The first two patients
who had full remission

00:07:04.583 --> 00:07:07.659
remain today leukemia-free,

00:07:07.683 --> 00:07:09.273
and we think they are cured.

00:07:09.297 --> 00:07:11.772
These are people
who had run out of options,

00:07:13.106 --> 00:07:15.783
and by all traditional methods they had,

00:07:15.807 --> 00:07:18.474
they were like modern-day Lazarus cases.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.564
All I can say is: thank goodness
for those forks in the road.

00:07:23.196 --> 00:07:27.706
Our next step was to get permission
to treat children with acute leukemia,

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.395
the most common form of cancer in kids.

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:33.442
The first patient we enrolled
on the trial was Emily Whitehead,

00:07:33.466 --> 00:07:35.514
and at that time, she was six years old.

00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:38.164
She had gone through
a series of chemotherapy

00:07:38.188 --> 00:07:40.728
and radiation treatments
over several years,

00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:42.602
and her leukemia had always come back.

00:07:42.626 --> 00:07:44.897
In fact, it had come back three times.

00:07:45.276 --> 00:07:48.076
When we first saw her, Emily was very ill.

00:07:51.244 --> 00:07:55.139
Her official diagnosis
was advanced, incurable leukemia.

00:07:55.822 --> 00:07:59.045
Cancer had invaded her bone marrow,
her liver, her spleen.

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:03.003
And when we infused her
with the CAR T cells

00:08:03.027 --> 00:08:05.669
in the spring of April 2012,

00:08:05.693 --> 00:08:08.242
over the next few days,
she did not get better.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.343
She got worse, and in fact, much worse.

00:08:11.367 --> 00:08:14.589
As our prison corrections
officer had in 2010,

00:08:14.613 --> 00:08:17.599
she, in 2012, was admitted to the ICU,

00:08:17.623 --> 00:08:20.964
and this was the scariest fork
in the whole road of this story.

00:08:21.559 --> 00:08:25.164
By day three, she was comatose
and on life support

00:08:26.522 --> 00:08:29.717
for kidney failure, lung failure and coma.

00:08:30.263 --> 00:08:34.640
Her fever was as high
as 106 degrees Fahrenheit for three days.

00:08:35.239 --> 00:08:37.982
And we didn't know
what was causing those fevers.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:41.125
We did all the standard
blood tests for infections,

00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:44.679
and we could not find
an infectious cause for her fever.

00:08:44.703 --> 00:08:48.640
But we did find something
very unusual in her blood

00:08:48.664 --> 00:08:50.992
that had never been seen
before in medicine.

00:08:51.374 --> 00:08:56.718
She had elevated levels of a protein
called interleukin-6, or IL-6,

00:08:56.742 --> 00:08:57.910
in her blood.

00:08:57.934 --> 00:09:02.962
It was, in fact, more than a thousandfold
above the normal levels.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.672
And here's where yet another
fork in the road came in.

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:10.175
By sheer coincidence,

00:09:10.199 --> 00:09:14.889
one of my daughters has a form
of pediatric arthritis.

00:09:16.505 --> 00:09:19.704
And as a result, I had been
following as a cancer doc,

00:09:19.728 --> 00:09:23.529
experimental therapies
for arthritis for my daughter,

00:09:23.553 --> 00:09:24.926
in case she would need them.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:29.173
And it so happened that just months
before Emily was admitted to the hospital,

00:09:29.197 --> 00:09:32.113
a new therapy had been approved by the FDA

00:09:32.137 --> 00:09:34.847
to treat elevated levels of interleukin-6.

00:09:34.871 --> 00:09:37.641
And it was approved for the arthritis
that my daughter had.

00:09:37.665 --> 00:09:39.265
It's called tocilizumab.

00:09:40.584 --> 00:09:45.718
And, in fact, it had just been added
to the pharmacy at Emily's hospital,

00:09:45.742 --> 00:09:47.395
for arthritis.

00:09:47.419 --> 00:09:50.498
So when we found Emily had
these very high levels of IL-6,

00:09:50.522 --> 00:09:53.260
I called her doctors in the ICU and said,

00:09:53.284 --> 00:09:56.266
"Why don't you treat her
with this arthritis drug?"

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.493
They said I was a cowboy
for suggesting that.

00:09:59.517 --> 00:10:01.954
And since her fever and low blood pressure

00:10:01.978 --> 00:10:05.268
had not responded to any other therapy,

00:10:05.292 --> 00:10:08.602
her doctor quickly asked permission
to the institutional review board,

00:10:08.626 --> 00:10:09.783
her parents,

00:10:09.807 --> 00:10:11.617
and everybody, of course, said yes.

00:10:11.641 --> 00:10:12.842
And they tried it,

00:10:12.866 --> 00:10:16.018
and the results were nothing
short of striking.

00:10:16.701 --> 00:10:19.359
Within hours after treatment
with tocilizumab,

00:10:19.383 --> 00:10:22.280
Emily began to improve very rapidly.

00:10:22.764 --> 00:10:26.098
Twenty-three days after her treatment,

00:10:26.122 --> 00:10:28.196
she was declared cancer-free.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:33.078
And today, she's 12 years old
and still in remission.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:41.816
(Applause)

00:10:44.707 --> 00:10:50.533
So we now call this violent reaction
of the high fevers and coma,

00:10:50.557 --> 00:10:51.715
following CAR T cells,

00:10:51.739 --> 00:10:54.363
cytokine release syndrome, or CRS.

00:10:54.387 --> 00:10:58.252
We've found that it occurs in nearly
all patients who respond to the therapy.

00:10:58.276 --> 00:11:01.649
But it does not happen
in those patients who fail to respond.

00:11:01.673 --> 00:11:03.331
So paradoxically,

00:11:04.466 --> 00:11:08.926
our patients now hope
for these high fevers after therapy,

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:11.752
which feels like
"the worst flu in their life,"

00:11:11.776 --> 00:11:13.546
when they get CAR T-cell therapies.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:14.875
They hope for this reaction

00:11:14.899 --> 00:11:18.029
because they know it's part
of the twisting and turning path

00:11:18.053 --> 00:11:19.379
back to health.

00:11:19.403 --> 00:11:21.753
Unfortunately, not every patient recovers.

00:11:22.458 --> 00:11:26.404
Patients who do not get CRS
are often those who are not cured.

00:11:27.258 --> 00:11:30.433
So there's a strong link now between CRS

00:11:30.457 --> 00:11:33.498
and the ability of the immune system
to eradicate leukemia.

00:11:33.973 --> 00:11:35.132
That's why last summer,

00:11:35.156 --> 00:11:40.346
when the FDA approved
CAR T cells for leukemia,

00:11:41.252 --> 00:11:47.370
they also co-approved the use
of tocilizumab to block the IL-6 effects

00:11:47.394 --> 00:11:50.405
and the accompanying CRS
in these patients.

00:11:50.711 --> 00:11:53.736
That was a very unusual event
in medical history.

00:11:54.784 --> 00:11:59.475
Emily's doctors have now
completed further trials

00:11:59.499 --> 00:12:04.107
and reported that 27 out of 30 patients,
the first 30 we treated,

00:12:04.131 --> 00:12:05.287
or 90 percent,

00:12:05.311 --> 00:12:06.694
had a complete remission

00:12:08.175 --> 00:12:10.378
after CAR T cells, within a month.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:15.330
A 90 percent complete remission rate
in patients with advanced cancer

00:12:15.354 --> 00:12:16.510
is unheard of

00:12:16.534 --> 00:12:19.407
in more than 50 years of cancer research.

00:12:19.431 --> 00:12:24.196
In fact, companies often declare
success in a cancer trial

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.768
if 15 percent of the patients
had a complete response rate.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:32.649
A remarkable study appeared in the
"New England Journal of Medicine" in 2013.

00:12:32.673 --> 00:12:35.989
An international study
has since confirmed those results.

00:12:36.442 --> 00:12:40.014
And that led to the approval by the FDA

00:12:40.038 --> 00:12:44.394
for pediatric and young adult
leukemia in August of 2017.

00:12:45.275 --> 00:12:48.702
So as a first-ever approval
of a cell and gene therapy,

00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:50.942
CAR T-cell therapy
has also been tested now

00:12:50.966 --> 00:12:53.538
in adults with refractory lymphoma.

00:12:53.885 --> 00:12:57.590
This disease afflicts about 20,000
a year in the United States.

00:12:58.004 --> 00:13:01.799
The results were equally impressive
and have been durable to date.

00:13:02.172 --> 00:13:07.049
And six months ago, the FDA approved
the therapy of this advanced lymphoma

00:13:07.073 --> 00:13:08.505
with CAR T cells.

00:13:08.974 --> 00:13:13.991
So now there are many labs and physicians
and scientists around the world

00:13:14.015 --> 00:13:16.112
who have tested CAR T cells

00:13:16.136 --> 00:13:18.946
across many different diseases,

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:23.407
and understandably, we're all thrilled
with the rapid pace of advancement.

00:13:23.431 --> 00:13:27.034
We're so grateful to see patients
who were formerly terminal

00:13:27.058 --> 00:13:30.201
return to healthy lives, as Emily has.

00:13:30.892 --> 00:13:34.058
We're thrilled to see long remissions
that may, in fact, be a cure.

00:13:34.363 --> 00:13:38.172
At the same time, we're also concerned
about the financial cost.

00:13:38.196 --> 00:13:43.021
It can cost up to 150,000 dollars
to make the CAR T cells for each patient.

00:13:43.696 --> 00:13:47.351
And when you add in the cost
of treating CRS and other complications,

00:13:47.375 --> 00:13:50.699
the cost can reach
one million dollars per patient.

00:13:51.343 --> 00:13:54.796
We must remember that the cost
of failure, though, is even worse.

00:13:55.271 --> 00:13:58.586
The current noncurative therapies
for cancer are also expensive

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:01.103
and, in addition, the patient dies.

00:14:01.744 --> 00:14:04.520
So, of course, we'd like to see
research done now

00:14:04.544 --> 00:14:07.364
to make this more efficient

00:14:08.367 --> 00:14:10.786
and increase affordability
to all patients.

00:14:11.176 --> 00:14:13.407
Fortunately, this is a new
and evolving field,

00:14:13.431 --> 00:14:16.975
and as with many other new
therapies and services,

00:14:16.999 --> 00:14:21.252
prices will come down as industry learns
to do things more efficiently.

00:14:21.737 --> 00:14:23.816
When I think about
all the forks in the road

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.950
that have led to CAR T-cell therapy,

00:14:25.974 --> 00:14:28.694
there is one thing that strikes me
as very important.

00:14:29.474 --> 00:14:33.053
We're reminded that discoveries
of this magnitude don't happen overnight.

00:14:33.426 --> 00:14:37.752
CAR T-cell therapies came to us
after a 30-year journey,

00:14:37.776 --> 00:14:40.736
along a road full of setbacks
and surprises.

00:14:41.093 --> 00:14:43.505
In all this world of instant gratification

00:14:43.529 --> 00:14:46.577
and 24/7, on-demand results,

00:14:46.601 --> 00:14:50.729
scientists require persistence,
vision and patience

00:14:50.753 --> 00:14:52.286
to rise above all that.

00:14:52.816 --> 00:14:57.729
They can see that the fork in the road
is not always a dilemma or a detour;

00:14:57.753 --> 00:15:01.063
sometimes, even though
we may not know it at the time,

00:15:01.087 --> 00:15:02.754
the fork is the way home.

00:15:03.452 --> 00:15:04.778
Thank you very much.

00:15:04.802 --> 00:15:08.678
(Applause)
