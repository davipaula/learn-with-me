00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.143
OK, today we're going
to talk about the mole.

00:00:19.167 --> 00:00:21.976
Now, I know what you're thinking:
"I know what a mole is,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.976
it's a small furry creature that digs holes
in the ground and destroys gardens."

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.976
And some of you might be thinking that it's a growth
on your aunt's face with hairs sticking out of it.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Well, in this case, a mole is a concept
that we use in chemistry to count molecules,

00:00:33.024 --> 00:00:35.976
atoms, just about anything
extremely small.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.048
Have you ever wondered how many atoms
there are in the universe?

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:41.976
Or in your body? Or
even in a grain of sand?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.239
Scientists have wanted
to answer that question,

00:00:44.263 --> 00:00:46.692
but how do you count something
as small as an atom?

00:00:46.716 --> 00:00:49.976
Well, in 1811, someone had an idea
that if you had equal volumes

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.239
of gases, at the same
temperature and pressure,

00:00:52.263 --> 00:00:54.549
they would contain an equal
number of particles.

00:00:54.573 --> 00:00:57.976
His name was Lorenzo Romano
Amedeo Carlo Avogadro.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.976
I wonder how long it took
him to sign autographs.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.976
Unfortunately for Avogadro, most scientists
didn't accept the idea of the atom,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.048
and there was no way
to prove he was right.

00:01:06.072 --> 00:01:08.976
There was no clear difference
between atoms and molecules.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.096
Most scientists looked at Avogadro's work
as purely hypothetical,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.976
and didn't give it much thought.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.976
But it turned out he was right!
By late 1860,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.976
Avogadro was proven correct,
and his work helped lay the foundation

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.976
for the atomic theory. Unfortunately,
Avogadro died in 1856.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.191
Now the thing is that the amount
of particles in even small samples

00:01:26.215 --> 00:01:28.976
is tremendous. For example,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.976
If you have a balloon of any gas
at zero degrees Celcius,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.976
and at a pressure of one atmosphere,
then you have precisely

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.143
six hundred and two sextillion
gas particles.

00:01:38.167 --> 00:01:41.976
That is, you have six with 23 zeros
after it particles of gas in the container.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.976
Or in scientific notation, 6.02
times 10 to the 23rd particles.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.976
This example is a little misleading,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.976
because gases take up a lot of space
due to the high kinetic energy

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.143
of the gas particles, and it leaves you
thinking atoms are bigger than they really are.

00:01:56.167 --> 00:01:57.976
Instead, think of water molecules.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.976
If you pour 18.01 grams
of water into a glass,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.976
which is 18.01 milliliters,
which is like three and a half teaspoons of water,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.976
you'll have 602 sextillion
molecules of water.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.976
Since Lorenzo Romano - uh, never mind - Avogadro
was the first one to come up with this idea,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.976
scientists named the number 6.02
times 10 to the 23rd after him.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.976
It is simply known as Avogadros's number.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.976
Now, back to the mole. Not that mole.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.976
This mole. Yep, this
number has a second name.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.976
The mole. Chemists use the term mole

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.976
to refer to the quantities
that are at the magnitude of 602 sextillion.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.976
This is known as a molar quantity.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.976
Atoms and molecules are so small, that chemists
have bundled them into groups called moles.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.381
Moles are hard for students to understand
because they have a hard time

00:02:42.405 --> 00:02:43.976
picturing the size of a mole,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.976
or of 602 sextillion.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.096
It's just too big to wrap
our brains around.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.976
Remember our 18.01 milliliters of water?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.976
Well, that's a mole of water.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.976
But how much is that?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.976
Exactly what does 602
sextillion look like?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.976
Maybe this'll help.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.976
Exchange the water particles for donuts.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.976
If you had a mole of donuts,
they would cover the entire earth

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.976
to a depth of eight kilometers,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.976
which is about five miles.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.976
You really need a lot of coffee for that.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
If you had a mole of basketballs,
you could create a new planet

00:03:14.024 --> 00:03:15.976
the size of the earth.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.096
If you received a mole of pennies on the day
you were born and spent a million dollars

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.976
a second until the day you died at the age
of 100, you would still have more than 99.99%

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.976
of your money in the bank.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.976
OK. Now we sort of have an idea
how large the mole is.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.976
So how do we use it?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.976
You might be surprised to know
that chemists use it the same way

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.976
you use pounds to buy
grapes, deli meat, or eggs.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.143
When you go to the grocery store,
you don't go to the deli counter

00:03:40.167 --> 00:03:43.310
and ask for 43 slices of salami,
you buy your salami by the pound.

00:03:43.334 --> 00:03:45.976
When you buy your eggs,
you buy a dozen eggs.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.048
When we hear the word dozen,
we probably think of the number 12.

00:03:49.072 --> 00:03:51.976
We also know that a pair is two,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.976
a baker's dozen is 13,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.976
a gross is 144, and a ream
of paper is - anybody?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.976
A ream is 500.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.976
Well, a mole is really the same thing.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.976
For a chemist, a mole conjures
up the number 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.976
not a fuzzy little animal.
The only difference is

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.976
that the other quantities
are more familiar to us.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.143
So there you have it -
the story of the mole,

00:04:14.167 --> 00:04:18.167
Avogadro, basketballs, and how to buy
salami at the grocery store.
