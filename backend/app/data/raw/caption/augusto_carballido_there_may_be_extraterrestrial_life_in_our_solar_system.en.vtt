00:00:06.937 --> 00:00:08.737
Deep in our solar system,

00:00:08.737 --> 00:00:12.737
a new era of space exploration
is unfolding.

00:00:12.737 --> 00:00:15.177
Beneath the thick ice of Europa,

00:00:15.177 --> 00:00:17.957
in the vapor plumes on Enceladus,

00:00:17.957 --> 00:00:20.747
and within the methane lakes of Titan,

00:00:20.747 --> 00:00:25.877
astrobiologists are on the hunt 
for extraterrestrial life.

00:00:25.877 --> 00:00:30.557
We’ve honed in on these three moons 
because each is an ‘ocean world,’

00:00:30.557 --> 00:00:33.587
an environment that contains 
a liquid ocean–

00:00:33.587 --> 00:00:37.877
and liquid can support 
the formation of life.

00:00:37.877 --> 00:00:42.884
Living organisms have to be able to grow, 
reproduce, and feed themselves,

00:00:42.884 --> 00:00:44.072
among other things.

00:00:44.072 --> 00:00:48.402
All of those functions require the 
formation of complex molecules

00:00:48.402 --> 00:00:50.400
from more basic components.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.330
Liquids such as water allow chemical 
compounds to remain in suspension

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.306
instead of sinking under 
the force of gravity.

00:00:58.306 --> 00:01:03.216
This enables them to interact frequently
in a 3-dimensional space and,

00:01:03.216 --> 00:01:04.626
in the right conditions,

00:01:04.626 --> 00:01:09.926
go through chemical reactions that 
lead to the formation of living matter.

00:01:09.926 --> 00:01:12.209
That alone isn’t enough;

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:16.469
the small but complex biomolecules 
that we’re familiar with

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:18.321
are sensitive to temperature—

00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:21.321
too hot or cold, and they won’t mix.

00:01:21.321 --> 00:01:24.431
Liquid water has an additional advantage

00:01:24.431 --> 00:01:26.901
in that it’s relatively 
temperature-stable,

00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:31.661
meaning it can insulate molecules against
large shifts in heat.

00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:35.782
On Earth, these and other conditions in 
aquatic environments

00:01:35.782 --> 00:01:39.685
may have supported the emergence 
of life billions of years ago.

00:01:39.685 --> 00:01:44.765
Tantalizingly, the same could be true
in other parts of our solar system,

00:01:44.765 --> 00:01:48.067
like these three icy moons.

00:01:48.067 --> 00:01:50.387
Europa, which is a moon of Jupiter,

00:01:50.387 --> 00:01:53.817
is probably the most 
intriguing ocean world.

00:01:53.817 --> 00:01:57.877
Beneath a surface layer of ice thicker 
than Mount Everest,

00:01:57.877 --> 00:02:02.395
there exists a liquid ocean as much as
100 kilometers deep.

00:02:02.395 --> 00:02:06.775
Astrobiologists think this hidden 
ocean could harbor life.

00:02:06.775 --> 00:02:08.643
Thanks to the Galileo probe,

00:02:08.643 --> 00:02:11.563
we can deduce that its 
potential salt content

00:02:11.563 --> 00:02:14.963
is similar to that of some lakes on Earth.

00:02:14.963 --> 00:02:19.993
But most of its characteristics will be a 
mystery until we can explore it further.

00:02:19.993 --> 00:02:25.500
Like Jupiter, Saturn also has moons that 
might have the right conditions for life.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.560
For instance– Enceladus is a tiny ball of 
ice that’s small enough to nestle

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.669
within the surface area 
of the Gulf of Mexico.

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:38.839
Similarly to Europa, it likely contains an
ocean deep under the ice.

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:41.667
But Enceladus also has geysers

00:02:41.667 --> 00:02:46.657
that frequently vent water vapor and 
tiny ice grains into space.

00:02:46.657 --> 00:02:50.123
Astrobiologists are curious about whether
these geysers

00:02:50.123 --> 00:02:52.483
are connected to the ocean below.

00:02:52.483 --> 00:02:56.673
They hope to send a probe to test whether
the geysers’ plumes of vapor

00:02:56.673 --> 00:03:01.248
contain life-enabling material
from that hidden sea.

00:03:01.248 --> 00:03:04.601
Although it’s the best known substance 
for nurturing life,

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:09.651
water isn’t necessarily the only medium
that can support living things.

00:03:09.651 --> 00:03:12.704
Take Titan, Saturn’s largest moon,

00:03:12.704 --> 00:03:14.954
which has a thick nitrogen atmosphere

00:03:14.954 --> 00:03:18.564
containing methane and many other 
organic molecules.

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:22.284
Its clouds condense and 
rain onto Titan’s surface,

00:03:22.284 --> 00:03:26.394
sustaining lakes and seas 
full of liquid methane.

00:03:26.394 --> 00:03:32.144
This compound’s particular chemistry means
it’s not as supportive a medium as water.

00:03:32.144 --> 00:03:35.806
But, paired with the high quantities 
of organic material

00:03:35.806 --> 00:03:38.086
that also rain down from the sky,

00:03:38.086 --> 00:03:43.736
these bodies of liquid methane could
possibly support unfamiliar life forms.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.250
So what might indicate that life exists on
these or other worlds?

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.310
If it is out there, astrobiologists 
speculate that it would be microscopic,

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.130
comparable to the bacteria 
we have on earth.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.190
This would make it difficult to directly 
observe from a great distance,

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.859
so astrobiologists seek clues 
called biosignatures.

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:11.779
Those may be cells, fossils, or mineral 
traces left behind by living things.

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:16.541
And finding any biosignatures will be 
challenging for many reasons.

00:04:16.541 --> 00:04:18.220
One of the biggest concerns

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.460
is to make sure we sterilize our 
probes extremely thoroughly.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.517
Otherwise we could accidentally 
contaminate ocean worlds

00:04:26.517 --> 00:04:28.640
with Earth’s own bacteria,

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.530
which could destroy alien life.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.320
Titan, Enceladus, and Europa

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.990
are just three of possibly many 
ocean worlds that we could explore.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.630
We already know of several other 
candidates in our solar system,

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.190
including Jupiter’s moons Callisto and 
Ganymede,

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.480
Neptune’s Triton, and even Pluto.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.840
If there’s this much potential for life
to exist in our own tiny solar system,

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.969
what unimagined secrets might the 
rest of the universe contain?
