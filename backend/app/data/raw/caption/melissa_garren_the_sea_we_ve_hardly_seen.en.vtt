00:00:05.485 --> 00:00:07.594
The sea we've hardly seen,

00:00:07.594 --> 00:00:09.980
that's what I'd like to talk about today.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.464
In the next ten minutes,

00:00:11.464 --> 00:00:15.337
we will immerse ourselves
in an amazing and beautiful marine world

00:00:15.337 --> 00:00:17.587
that's very often overlooked.

00:00:17.807 --> 00:00:20.100
I'd like to take you
on a journey into the sea,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.640
looking at it from the perspective
of its smallest inhabitants:

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.917
the microbes.

00:00:25.067 --> 00:00:27.494
My goal is that after this short journey,

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:29.278
you'll share my amazement

00:00:29.278 --> 00:00:33.441
at how deeply connected our lives
are to these microscopic creatures

00:00:33.441 --> 00:00:35.580
and also perhaps my concern

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.326
that these relationships
are often neglected

00:00:38.326 --> 00:00:42.386
when it comes to making decisions
and policies about our oceans.

00:00:43.806 --> 00:00:46.640
When you look out on a clear blue ocean,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.672
you're actually gazing
at a microbial soup full of vibrant life.

00:00:50.912 --> 00:00:54.488
What you see here
are marine bacteria buzzing about

00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:57.196
and exploring other members
of the marine food web.

00:00:57.196 --> 00:01:01.021
To emphasize how small
this world really is,

00:01:01.691 --> 00:01:05.388
I've added a white line
to most of my slides

00:01:05.388 --> 00:01:08.902
that shows you the thickness
of a single strand of human hair -

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:09.973
very tiny.

00:01:09.973 --> 00:01:12.985
An average teaspoon of clean seawater

00:01:12.985 --> 00:01:17.261
has five million bacteria
and 50 million viruses in it.

00:01:17.261 --> 00:01:20.426
If I were to scoop up
two gallons of seawater,

00:01:20.426 --> 00:01:22.985
there would be more bacteria
in those two gallons

00:01:22.985 --> 00:01:25.558
than there are people on this planet.

00:01:25.748 --> 00:01:30.488
Take just a moment and think about
how many gallons might make up an ocean.

00:01:30.697 --> 00:01:32.793
Or maybe I've already made
your stomach turn

00:01:32.793 --> 00:01:34.461
as you think of all of the seawater

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:36.878
we've each accidentally
swallowed over the years.

00:01:37.288 --> 00:01:40.530
But luckily, we rarely get sick
from that seawater,

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.315
because most marine microbes
are working for us,

00:01:43.315 --> 00:01:44.862
not against us.

00:01:44.862 --> 00:01:46.490
One of my favorite examples

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.205
is that they provide
half of the oxygen we breathe.

00:01:50.385 --> 00:01:52.871
In middle school,
we all learn to thank the trees.

00:01:52.871 --> 00:01:56.432
And admittedly, they may be
more huggable than the microbes.

00:01:56.432 --> 00:01:57.526
But it turns out

00:01:57.526 --> 00:02:01.568
that land plants only create
a quarter of the oxygen we breathe.

00:02:01.568 --> 00:02:04.792
Another quarter comes
from macroalgae like kelp

00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:07.252
and a full 50% from the microbes.

00:02:07.512 --> 00:02:09.321
Take a deep breath in.

00:02:09.821 --> 00:02:11.521
Thank the trees.

00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:13.998
Take another deep breath in.

00:02:14.188 --> 00:02:16.079
Thank the macroalgae.

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:19.994
For your next two breaths,
tip your hats to the microbes.

00:02:19.994 --> 00:02:21.832
This picture is of a bacterium

00:02:21.832 --> 00:02:27.140
that happens to be the single most
abundant photosynthesizer on our planet.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.548
It's called "Prochlorococcus,"

00:02:29.548 --> 00:02:33.584
and this is oceans'
oxygen-producing powerhouse

00:02:33.584 --> 00:02:34.734
and, I might argue,

00:02:34.734 --> 00:02:38.875
one of the most amazing discoveries
of recent marine microbiology.

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:42.247
We didn't know it existed until 1988.

00:02:42.247 --> 00:02:45.277
All of human history has depended
on this little microbe

00:02:45.277 --> 00:02:50.205
for the oxygen they breathe every day,
no matter where or when they lived.

00:02:50.205 --> 00:02:54.287
And we've only been aware
of that relationship for a mere 24 years.

00:02:54.437 --> 00:02:56.123
I find that astounding.

00:02:56.123 --> 00:02:58.467
How many more critical
relationships are out there

00:02:58.467 --> 00:03:00.356
that we have yet to discover?

00:03:00.356 --> 00:03:04.106
I see our relationship with marine
microbes as parallel in many ways

00:03:04.106 --> 00:03:07.555
to the relationship we have
with microbes in our gut.

00:03:08.075 --> 00:03:11.112
We've all experienced
the wrath of unhappy gut microbes,

00:03:11.112 --> 00:03:12.603
at one point or another,

00:03:12.603 --> 00:03:15.261
perhaps food poisoning or tainted water.

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:19.233
But we may be less aware of the connection
we have with marine microbes

00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:24.504
and the physical discomforts we can feel
when those communities change.

00:03:24.714 --> 00:03:29.021
As an extreme example: the disease
cholera is caused by a bacterium

00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:30.562
that thrives in the ocean.

00:03:30.562 --> 00:03:34.460
So, while most marine microbes
are indeed helping us,

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.701
there do remain plenty that are not.

00:03:36.891 --> 00:03:40.109
Our relationship with the ocean,
much like our gut,

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.063
is dependent on the right
balance of microbes.

00:03:43.233 --> 00:03:47.545
The old phrase "You are what you eat"
applies to our ocean microbes as well.

00:03:47.545 --> 00:03:51.243
To give you a sense of what
an overfed ocean may look like,

00:03:51.243 --> 00:03:53.824
here are two examples
of me sampling seawater.

00:03:53.824 --> 00:03:56.900
On your left, it's a clean coral reef,

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.850
and on your right
is a nearly dead coral reef

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.835
that has a very intense fish farming
operation in the waters there.

00:04:03.835 --> 00:04:07.717
You'll notice I'm only smiling
in one of these two pictures,

00:04:07.887 --> 00:04:11.398
and in the other one, my dive buddy
had to be a whole lot closer

00:04:11.398 --> 00:04:13.074
to capture that image.

00:04:13.354 --> 00:04:18.179
So, if we were to take a drop of seawater
from each of these samples

00:04:18.179 --> 00:04:20.075
and put it under the microscope,

00:04:20.075 --> 00:04:23.160
this is what the bacteria
and viral communities would look like.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.944
So again, clean reef on your left,
fish farm reef on your right.

00:04:26.944 --> 00:04:33.043
As we all have had a feeling of discomfort
from imbalanced gut microbes,

00:04:33.362 --> 00:04:35.365
a fish swimming
through a part of the ocean

00:04:35.365 --> 00:04:37.185
that has been overfed in this way -

00:04:37.185 --> 00:04:39.109
in this case by intense aquaculture,

00:04:39.109 --> 00:04:41.735
but it could be a sewage spill
or fertilizer runoff

00:04:41.735 --> 00:04:43.852
or any number of other sources -

00:04:43.852 --> 00:04:46.069
that fish will feel
the physical discomforts

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:48.469
of the ocean microbes
being out of whack.

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:50.681
There may be less oxygen present,

00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:52.688
there may be more pathogens there,

00:04:52.688 --> 00:04:56.001
and there may be toxins
produced by some of these microbes.

00:04:56.261 --> 00:04:57.321
The bottom line

00:04:57.321 --> 00:04:59.897
is that from their tiny-scale existence,

00:04:59.897 --> 00:05:03.035
these tiny microbes have
a very large-scale power

00:05:03.035 --> 00:05:05.199
to control how our ocean smells,

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:06.496
how it tastes,

00:05:06.496 --> 00:05:07.634
how it feels,

00:05:07.634 --> 00:05:09.288
and how it looks.

00:05:10.418 --> 00:05:14.597
If you take one idea away
from my talk today, let it be this:

00:05:14.877 --> 00:05:19.104
we have an incredibly important
relationship with these marine microbes

00:05:19.104 --> 00:05:21.512
that have very large-scale consequences,

00:05:21.512 --> 00:05:23.703
and we're just barely
beginning to understand

00:05:23.703 --> 00:05:25.593
what that relationship looks like

00:05:25.593 --> 00:05:27.422
and how it may be changing.

00:05:27.422 --> 00:05:31.740
Just as a physician will have trouble
curing a disease of unknown cause,

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.372
we will have similar trouble
restoring ocean health

00:05:34.372 --> 00:05:36.373
without understanding the microbes better.

00:05:36.373 --> 00:05:39.858
They are the invisible engineers
that control the chemistry of the ocean,

00:05:39.858 --> 00:05:42.318
and therefore what creatures
can live there,

00:05:42.318 --> 00:05:44.654
whether or not it's safe
for us to swim there,

00:05:44.654 --> 00:05:46.407
and all of the other characteristics

00:05:46.407 --> 00:05:49.311
we sense with our eyes,
noses and taste buds.

00:05:49.311 --> 00:05:50.755
And the more we pay attention

00:05:50.755 --> 00:05:53.744
to these small but very
numerous members of the ocean,

00:05:53.744 --> 00:05:57.314
the more we're learning
they do indeed respond to human actions,

00:05:57.314 --> 00:05:59.600
such as in this fish farm example.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.821
Now, as the past few slides
about coral reefs may have suggested,

00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:05.543
I do indeed spend much
of my time as a researcher

00:06:05.543 --> 00:06:07.993
thinking about human-microbe interactions,

00:06:07.993 --> 00:06:10.301
specifically on coral reefs.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.848
It turns out, we're not alone in having
our own protective community of microbes.

00:06:14.848 --> 00:06:18.376
Corals, along with most
other organisms on this planet,

00:06:18.376 --> 00:06:21.371
have their own protective
communities as well.

00:06:21.371 --> 00:06:25.759
However, rather than keeping theirs
on the inside as we do in our gut,

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:29.316
they keep theirs on the outside,
to protect them from their surroundings.

00:06:29.316 --> 00:06:31.036
So, what you're seeing here

00:06:31.306 --> 00:06:35.567
is a three-dimensional image
of a live spot on a living coral

00:06:35.567 --> 00:06:37.447
with all of its living bacteria,

00:06:37.447 --> 00:06:39.533
that I took with some
exciting technology -

00:06:39.533 --> 00:06:43.096
a high-speed laser-scanning
confocal microscope.

00:06:43.196 --> 00:06:46.101
All of the red circles
are the symbiotic algae

00:06:46.101 --> 00:06:48.334
that live inside the coral tissue,

00:06:48.334 --> 00:06:51.815
turning sunlight into sugars
they both can use,

00:06:51.815 --> 00:06:56.799
and all of the little blue dots
are the protective bacteria.

00:06:57.239 --> 00:07:00.250
So, when I use image analysis software

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.657
to highlight the outer layer
of the coral in white,

00:07:03.657 --> 00:07:06.484
you can see that there are still
some tiny little blue dots

00:07:06.484 --> 00:07:08.030
above that layer.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.524
And those bacteria are sitting
in a mucus layer,

00:07:11.524 --> 00:07:15.192
which is also part
of the coral's protective layer.

00:07:15.192 --> 00:07:16.528
From the bigger perspective,

00:07:16.528 --> 00:07:18.903
I spend my time thinking
about these relationships

00:07:18.903 --> 00:07:22.434
because too many reefs are going
from looking like the picture on your left

00:07:22.434 --> 00:07:23.826
to the picture on your right.

00:07:23.826 --> 00:07:24.859
Believe it or not,

00:07:24.859 --> 00:07:28.506
the picture on your right remains
a very popular tourist snorkeling spot

00:07:28.506 --> 00:07:30.035
on the island of Maui,

00:07:30.035 --> 00:07:33.545
even though it's lost most of its coral
cover over the past decade or so.

00:07:33.545 --> 00:07:36.612
Corals are getting sick
all around the globe at alarming rates,

00:07:36.612 --> 00:07:39.450
and we really don't know how or why.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:45.122
I see the microbes on the coral reefs,
both the good ones and the bad ones,

00:07:45.352 --> 00:07:50.512
trying to link their micro-scale
behaviors to this big picture:

00:07:50.692 --> 00:07:53.600
how do we help the reef
that looks like the right

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.352
back towards something
that looks more like the left?

00:07:56.352 --> 00:07:59.072
Or: how do we stop
coral disease from spreading?

00:07:59.072 --> 00:08:02.817
Just over a year ago,
no one had ever seen a view like this.

00:08:03.007 --> 00:08:07.917
This video is a prime example
of making the invisible visible.

00:08:08.137 --> 00:08:11.001
We're looking at a side view
of the same coral as before,

00:08:11.001 --> 00:08:13.231
where the protective layer
meets the seawater;

00:08:13.231 --> 00:08:14.883
so, seawater on your right,

00:08:14.883 --> 00:08:16.506
coral on your left.

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:20.575
It's incredibly exciting to me
that we can finally see these bacteria

00:08:20.575 --> 00:08:24.448
in real life, in real time,
at their micro scale,

00:08:24.608 --> 00:08:27.313
and learn how they interact
with the world around them.

00:08:27.313 --> 00:08:31.303
Ecologists all over the world are used
to being able to grab a pair of binoculars

00:08:31.303 --> 00:08:34.802
and go out and observe
what their study creatures do each day.

00:08:34.802 --> 00:08:37.612
But microbial ecologists
have desperately needed

00:08:37.612 --> 00:08:39.186
breakthroughs in technology,

00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:41.168
such as with this fast confocal,

00:08:41.168 --> 00:08:43.347
to make similar observations.

00:08:44.007 --> 00:08:45.469
I work to find ways

00:08:45.469 --> 00:08:51.012
that cutting-edge technologies like this
can help make the unseen seeable,

00:08:51.012 --> 00:08:55.000
to see marine bacteria in action
and learn how they behave.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.170
In doing so, we can learn

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.886
how they respond to our actions
and our behaviors

00:08:59.886 --> 00:09:01.784
and the environment around them

00:09:01.784 --> 00:09:04.341
in ways that will help us
better manage our oceans.

00:09:04.341 --> 00:09:07.904
Another example of how I'm doing this

00:09:08.394 --> 00:09:11.674
is by using microfluidics

00:09:12.404 --> 00:09:16.068
to study specifically
how pathogens behave in the ocean.

00:09:16.168 --> 00:09:18.104
The basic idea behind microfluidics

00:09:18.104 --> 00:09:20.535
is that you can use
nanofabrication techniques

00:09:20.535 --> 00:09:24.933
to recreate or mimic
the conditions bacteria experience

00:09:24.933 --> 00:09:27.561
at their own tiny scale in the ocean.

00:09:27.661 --> 00:09:32.485
What you see here is a microfluidic
chamber on a microscope slide

00:09:32.485 --> 00:09:35.227
with a microscope lens underneath it.

00:09:35.227 --> 00:09:39.859
We use high-speed video microscopy
to record bacteria behavior.

00:09:40.009 --> 00:09:41.017
The colored tubing

00:09:41.017 --> 00:09:44.276
is where bacteria and seawater
flow in and out of the device.

00:09:44.276 --> 00:09:47.921
And it's using a device like this
that I recently discovered

00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:51.012
that a known coral pathogen
actually has the ability

00:09:51.012 --> 00:09:54.450
to sniff around the seawater
and hunt for corals.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.766
Here's the video of it in action.

00:09:58.066 --> 00:10:02.517
You'll see all of the pathogens,
which are the tiny green dots on the left,

00:10:02.517 --> 00:10:06.428
start detecting the coral mucus
I put on the right side of the channel,

00:10:06.428 --> 00:10:10.762
and they swim quickly over
in that direction and stay there.

00:10:10.972 --> 00:10:12.681
Up until now, it was thought

00:10:12.681 --> 00:10:17.294
that a pathogen would need some
good luck to find its host in the ocean.

00:10:17.424 --> 00:10:21.758
But simply by watching and observing,
we can learn that these bacteria

00:10:21.758 --> 00:10:25.313
are very well adapted
to seeking out their victims.

00:10:25.313 --> 00:10:28.614
These micro-channels are bringing
us closer than ever before

00:10:28.614 --> 00:10:32.583
to understanding how bacteria
navigate that big blue ocean.

00:10:32.713 --> 00:10:38.137
It turns out that this pathogen
can even detect the coral mucus

00:10:38.137 --> 00:10:40.947
when I dilute it 20,000 fold.

00:10:40.947 --> 00:10:42.035
(Laughter)

00:10:42.945 --> 00:10:47.599
So these bacteria are very well adapted
to hunting down these corals.

00:10:48.529 --> 00:10:51.421
I'm currently testing different
environmental conditions

00:10:51.421 --> 00:10:53.268
to see what scenarios

00:10:53.268 --> 00:10:57.046
make this pathogen more
or less capable of hunting corals.

00:10:57.256 --> 00:10:59.650
By learning more
about what triggers the hunt,

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:04.040
we should be able to find ways
to help slow down or prevent this disease.

00:11:04.487 --> 00:11:06.164
There's also some evidence

00:11:06.164 --> 00:11:10.761
that the healthy microbes on the coral
can fight off the pathogen

00:11:10.761 --> 00:11:13.226
if the conditions are right.

00:11:13.946 --> 00:11:17.680
So, one final image of a coral
and its healthy bacteria.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.882
I hope you've enjoyed this short journey
into our microbial oceans

00:11:20.882 --> 00:11:23.263
and that the next time
you look out at the sea,

00:11:23.263 --> 00:11:26.456
you'll take in a deep breath
of fresh ocean air and wonder:

00:11:26.456 --> 00:11:29.289
what else are all
of the unseen microbes doing

00:11:29.289 --> 00:11:31.790
to keep us and our oceans healthy?

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.176
Thank you.

00:11:33.246 --> 00:11:34.706
(Applause)
