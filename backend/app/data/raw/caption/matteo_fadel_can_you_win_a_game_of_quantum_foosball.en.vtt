00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.970
After a long day working 
on the local particle accelerator,

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.990
you and your friends head to the arcade
to unwind.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.810
The lights go out for a second, 
and when they come back,

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.108
there before you gleams a foosball table
nobody remembers seeing before.

00:00:22.108 --> 00:00:24.688
Always game, you insert your coins.

00:00:24.688 --> 00:00:28.688
And with a fanfare,
Quantum Foosball begins.

00:00:28.688 --> 00:00:31.531
Here are the rules: 
as with normal foosball,

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.161
the object is to score points

00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:38.086
by spinning levers with tiny players 
to sink the ball in your opponent’s goal.

00:00:38.086 --> 00:00:42.361
Only instead of a standard ball, 
you’ll be playing with a giant electron.

00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:46.874
It behaves like a normal electron 
in all respects, it’s just much larger.

00:00:46.874 --> 00:00:51.001
Though the rules are simple, 
gameplay is anything but.

00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:54.061
Instead of the familiar laws 
of Newtonian physics,

00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:57.951
the movement of the ball is governed
by quantum mechanics.

00:00:57.951 --> 00:01:01.761
To minimize the influence 
from photons and air molecules,

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:04.741
you’ll be playing in a vacuum.
In the dark.

00:01:04.741 --> 00:01:07.891
But that’s ok, because you can watch
for the flashes of light

00:01:07.891 --> 00:01:11.891
given off by collisions 
between figures and the ball.

00:01:11.891 --> 00:01:14.619
The goals themselves will flash 
when the electron

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.899
hits their particle detectors.

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.561
Now you just have to figure out how 
to get the electron to go where you want.

00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:25.561
As soon as it enters play, 
the electron will never rest.

00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:29.726
This is a direct consequence 
of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle,

00:01:29.726 --> 00:01:33.366
which says that the better you know
where a quantum particle is,

00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:37.366
the less you know about its velocity,
and vice versa.

00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:42.202
Since you know it’s on the field, 
its velocity is largely uncertain.

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:45.412
The electron will behave more like a wave
than a particle,

00:01:45.412 --> 00:01:50.621
with its position described by probability
distributions that you’ll have to imagine.

00:01:50.621 --> 00:01:54.621
These distributions are spread throughout
the entire field,

00:01:54.621 --> 00:02:00.429
making it possible to observe a goal 
at any time and in either side.

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:04.706
The way to win is to control 
and concentrate the distribution

00:02:04.706 --> 00:02:06.976
over the opposite goal,

00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:11.463
giving yourself the highest likelihood
of scoring points.

00:02:11.463 --> 00:02:15.488
Your skill as a player will be determined
by your ability to predict

00:02:15.488 --> 00:02:18.438
where the electron is most likely to be,

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:22.752
then manipulate the probability
distribution by spinning the rods

00:02:22.752 --> 00:02:25.242
with just the right amount of strength.

00:02:25.242 --> 00:02:30.531
Quantum particles only receive energy
in precise amounts, called quanta.

00:02:30.531 --> 00:02:33.091
So spin too hard or too soft,

00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:36.731
and the electron will stay 
on its previous course.

00:02:36.731 --> 00:02:40.591
The game board has been carefully
constructed to contain the electron,

00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:44.541
but even so, sometimes it’ll quantum 
tunnel through the walls

00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:46.261
without any apparent reason.

00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:49.291
At that point it could be anywhere 
in the universe,

00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:51.601
so to save you the trouble 
of tracking it down,

00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:53.981
the game will spit out a new ball.

00:02:53.981 --> 00:02:57.131
The fact that quantum particles behave
like waves

00:02:57.131 --> 00:03:01.131
becomes particularly evident 
in the presence of obstacles.

00:03:01.131 --> 00:03:04.601
As the particle travels through the rows
of miniature figures,

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:09.216
complicated interference patterns will
develop in the probability distribution,

00:03:09.216 --> 00:03:13.701
making it even more difficult 
to accurately predict its position.

00:03:13.701 --> 00:03:18.172
And here’s where your advanced physics
degree can finally come in handy:

00:03:18.172 --> 00:03:22.312
you can use the laws of quantum mechanics
to your advantage.

00:03:22.312 --> 00:03:25.632
The only moments when the electron
will behave as a particle,

00:03:25.632 --> 00:03:28.832
rather than a wave, 
are when it hits something.

00:03:28.832 --> 00:03:30.492
With frequent enough kicks,

00:03:30.492 --> 00:03:34.492
the particle would have no time to evolve
like a wave and, therefore,

00:03:34.492 --> 00:03:36.812
not spread out in space.

00:03:36.812 --> 00:03:40.812
So if you can pass it very quickly 
between two of your miniatures,

00:03:40.812 --> 00:03:42.762
you can keep it localized.

00:03:42.762 --> 00:03:47.446
Masters of the game call this 
the Quantum Zeno Maneuver.

00:03:47.446 --> 00:03:50.246
Now, if you really want to dominate
your opponents,

00:03:50.246 --> 00:03:53.766
there’s one more thing you can try,
but it’s pretty tricky.

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:56.596
One of the distinctive features 
of the quantum world

00:03:56.596 --> 00:04:00.086
is the possibility 
of state superpositions,

00:04:00.086 --> 00:04:02.706
where particles’ positions or velocities

00:04:02.706 --> 00:04:07.223
can be simultaneously in two or more
different states.

00:04:07.223 --> 00:04:10.613
If you can put the electron 
into a superposition

00:04:10.613 --> 00:04:14.303
of being simultaneously kicked
and not kicked,

00:04:14.303 --> 00:04:17.823
it’ll be almost impossible 
for your opponents to figure out

00:04:17.823 --> 00:04:20.033
where and how to strike.

00:04:20.033 --> 00:04:22.016
It’s said that Erwin Schrödinger,

00:04:22.016 --> 00:04:25.463
the greatest Quantum Foosball champion
of all time,

00:04:25.463 --> 00:04:28.463
is the only player to have mastered
this technique.

00:04:28.463 --> 00:04:31.353
But maybe you can be the second:

00:04:31.353 --> 00:04:36.423
Just figure out a way to simultaneously
turn and not turn your rods.
