00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:16.309
Ever since I was a young girl,
I was always fascinated --

00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:17.490
(Laughter)

00:00:17.514 --> 00:00:18.665
Oh!

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:20.789
(Laughter)

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:23.483
OK, I meant younger and more short.

00:00:23.507 --> 00:00:24.680
(Laughter)

00:00:24.704 --> 00:00:26.704
If that's possible to imagine.

00:00:27.101 --> 00:00:29.172
But ever since I was a young girl,

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:33.736
I was always fascinated with how
the world worked exactly how it did.

00:00:34.403 --> 00:00:36.871
So this, very early on,

00:00:36.895 --> 00:00:40.295
led me to the fields
of mathematics and chemistry.

00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:45.228
I would keep going further and further,
and as I kept going,

00:00:45.252 --> 00:00:48.627
I realized that all the fields
of science are interconnected.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.942
And without one, the others
have little or no value.

00:00:54.188 --> 00:00:58.330
So, inspired by Marie Curie
and my local science museum,

00:00:58.354 --> 00:01:01.649
I decided to start asking
these questions myself

00:01:01.673 --> 00:01:04.498
and engage in my own independent research,

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:07.225
whether it be out
of my garage or my bedroom.

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:10.407
I started reading journal papers,

00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:12.708
started doing science competitions,

00:01:12.732 --> 00:01:15.589
started participating in science fairs,

00:01:15.613 --> 00:01:17.489
doing anything I could

00:01:17.513 --> 00:01:20.402
to get the knowledge
that I so desperately wanted.

00:01:21.712 --> 00:01:25.871
So while I was studying anatomy
for a competition,

00:01:25.895 --> 00:01:29.895
I came across the topic
of something called chronic wounds.

00:01:30.371 --> 00:01:34.669
And one thing that stood out
to me was a statistic

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:39.783
that said that the number of people
in the United States with chronic wounds

00:01:39.807 --> 00:01:43.387
exceeds the number of people
with breast cancer,

00:01:43.411 --> 00:01:48.721
colon cancer, lung cancer
and leukemia, combined.

00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:51.117
Hold up.

00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:52.672
So what is a chronic wound?

00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:53.847
(Laughter)

00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:57.276
And why haven't I heard
about a 5K walk for chronic wounds,

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.251
why haven't I even heard
about a chronic wound in general?

00:02:00.275 --> 00:02:02.323
(Laughter)

00:02:04.387 --> 00:02:07.355
So after I got past
those preliminary questions,

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:09.672
and one that I will clarify for you,

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:13.506
a chronic wound is essentially
when someone gets a normal wound,

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.188
except it fails to heal normally

00:02:16.212 --> 00:02:19.950
because the patient has some kind
of preexisting condition,

00:02:19.974 --> 00:02:22.107
which in most cases is diabetes.

00:02:25.613 --> 00:02:28.637
So more staggering statistics
were to be found

00:02:28.661 --> 00:02:31.085
as I kept going on in this research.

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.913
In the year 2010 alone,

00:02:32.937 --> 00:02:39.376
50 billion dollars were spent worldwide
to treat chronic wounds.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.418
In addition, it's estimated
that about two percent of the population

00:02:43.442 --> 00:02:46.394
will get a chronic wound
at some point in their lifetime.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.132
This was absurd.

00:02:49.244 --> 00:02:50.991
So as I started doing more research,

00:02:51.015 --> 00:02:52.736
I found that there was a correlation

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.379
between the moisture level
inside a wound dressing

00:02:55.403 --> 00:02:59.283
and the stage of healing
that the chronic wound would be at.

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.657
So I decided, why don't I design something

00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:04.910
to measure the moisture level
within the wound

00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:09.242
so this can help doctors and patients
treat their wounds better.

00:03:09.696 --> 00:03:13.061
And essentially, expedite
the healing process.

00:03:13.085 --> 00:03:15.685
So that's exactly what I set out to do.

00:03:16.157 --> 00:03:20.331
Being a 14-year-old working
out of her garage-turned-lab,

00:03:20.355 --> 00:03:22.395
I had a lot of constraints.

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:26.204
Most being that I wasn't given a grant,
I wasn't given a lot of money,

00:03:26.228 --> 00:03:28.766
and I wasn't given a lot of resources.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.305
In addition, I had
a lot of criteria, as well.

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.020
Since this product would be
readily interacting with the body,

00:03:36.044 --> 00:03:38.220
it had to be biocompatible,

00:03:38.244 --> 00:03:40.181
it also had to be low-cost,

00:03:40.205 --> 00:03:43.116
as I was designing it
and paying for it myself.

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:46.379
It also had to be mass-manufacturable,

00:03:46.403 --> 00:03:49.438
because I wanted it to be made
anywhere, for anyone.

00:03:51.442 --> 00:03:53.458
Thus, I drafted up a schematic.

00:03:53.482 --> 00:03:57.974
What you see on the left hand-side
is the early schematics in my design,

00:03:57.998 --> 00:04:03.342
showing both a bird's-eye view
and also one stacking variant.

00:04:03.366 --> 00:04:04.541
A stacking variant means

00:04:04.565 --> 00:04:09.755
that the entire product is consisted
of different individual parts

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:11.569
that have to work in unison.

00:04:11.593 --> 00:04:15.575
And what's shown there
is one possible arrangement.

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.047
So what exactly is this?

00:04:20.665 --> 00:04:22.664
So I had gone on to testing my sensors

00:04:22.688 --> 00:04:26.204
and as all scientists have
stumbles along their work,

00:04:26.228 --> 00:04:29.776
I also had a couple of problems
in my first generation of sensors.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.505
First of all, I couldn't figure out

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:34.498
how to get a nanoparticle ink
into a printcheck cartridge

00:04:34.522 --> 00:04:36.450
without spilling it all over my carpet.

00:04:36.799 --> 00:04:38.251
That was problem number one.

00:04:38.792 --> 00:04:40.054
Problem number two was,

00:04:40.078 --> 00:04:43.522
I couldn't exactly control
the sensitivity of my sensors.

00:04:43.546 --> 00:04:46.053
I couldn't scale them up or down,

00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:48.157
I couldn't really do
anything of that sort.

00:04:48.181 --> 00:04:49.819
So I wanted something to solve it.

00:04:49.843 --> 00:04:52.934
Problem one was easily solved
by some scouting on eBay and Amazon

00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.703
for syringes that I could use.

00:04:54.727 --> 00:04:57.839
Problem two, however,
required a lot more thought.

00:04:57.863 --> 00:05:00.053
So this is where this factors in.

00:05:00.077 --> 00:05:01.717
So what a space-filling curve does

00:05:01.741 --> 00:05:06.156
is it aims to take up all the area it can
within one unit square.

00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:10.914
And by writing a computer program,
you can have different iterations

00:05:10.938 --> 00:05:12.458
of the different curve,

00:05:12.482 --> 00:05:14.744
which increasingly get close
to one unit square,

00:05:14.768 --> 00:05:16.768
but never quite reaches there.

00:05:18.212 --> 00:05:20.653
So now I could control
the thickness, the size,

00:05:20.677 --> 00:05:24.038
I could do whatever I want with it,
and I could predict my results.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.943
So I started constructing my sensors

00:05:27.967 --> 00:05:30.094
and testing them more rigorously,

00:05:30.118 --> 00:05:33.681
using money that I had gotten
from previous science fair awards.

00:05:34.177 --> 00:05:38.065
Lastly, I had to connect this data
in order to be read.

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:40.558
So I interfaced it with a Bluetooth chip,

00:05:40.582 --> 00:05:43.835
which you can see here
by the app screenshots on the right.

00:05:44.346 --> 00:05:48.141
And what this does is that anyone
can monitor the progress of their wound,

00:05:48.165 --> 00:05:52.579
and it can be transmitted
over a wireless connection

00:05:52.603 --> 00:05:55.803
to the doctor, the patient
or whoever needs it.

00:05:57.079 --> 00:05:59.081
[Continued Testing and Refinement]

00:05:59.105 --> 00:06:02.859
So in conclusion, my design
was successful --

00:06:02.883 --> 00:06:05.652
however, science never ends.

00:06:06.097 --> 00:06:09.156
There's always something to be done,
something to be refined.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.013
So that's what I'm currently
in the process of doing.

00:06:12.776 --> 00:06:14.829
However, what I learned was

00:06:14.853 --> 00:06:18.149
what's more important
than the actual thing I designed

00:06:18.173 --> 00:06:21.706
is an attitude that I had
taken on while doing this.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.315
And that attitude was,

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:27.673
even though I'm a 14-year-old
working in her garage

00:06:27.697 --> 00:06:31.394
on something that she doesn't
completely understand,

00:06:31.418 --> 00:06:34.907
I could still make a difference
and contribute to the field.

00:06:35.792 --> 00:06:38.212
And that's what inspired me to keep going,

00:06:38.236 --> 00:06:42.093
and I hope it inspires many others
to also do work like this

00:06:42.117 --> 00:06:44.720
even though they're not
very sure about it.

00:06:45.768 --> 00:06:48.332
So I hope that's a message
that you all take on today.

00:06:48.356 --> 00:06:49.539
Thank you.

00:06:49.563 --> 00:06:56.292
(Applause)
