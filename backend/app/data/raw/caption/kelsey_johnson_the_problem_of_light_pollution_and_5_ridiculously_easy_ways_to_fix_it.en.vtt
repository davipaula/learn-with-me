00:00:13.208 --> 00:00:17.351
Unless you've spent quality time
on the International Space Station,

00:00:17.375 --> 00:00:20.809
this is probably not a view
you are super familiar with.

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:23.851
This is the east coast
of the United States.

00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:26.101
That's New York down there
in the lower right,

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:30.309
and it's a band of light
all the way up through Washington DC.

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.684
Those cities are shining like jewels,

00:00:32.708 --> 00:00:36.309
highways are traced by webs of light.

00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:39.559
And all of that light is super photogenic.

00:00:39.583 --> 00:00:41.042
But there's a problem.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:45.851
That light is meant to be
illuminating our sidewalks,

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:47.976
and our streets and our houses.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.643
Instead, it's actually
going up into the sky

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:52.268
and out into the universe,

00:00:52.292 --> 00:00:54.375
where it's not doing any of us any good.

00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:59.101
When I see photos of this, of the Earth,

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:01.250
I see environmental catastrophe.

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:04.518
Those aren't jewels,

00:01:04.542 --> 00:01:05.833
those are tumors.

00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.226
I'm an astronomer,

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.851
so it's really no surprise
probably to anyone

00:01:11.875 --> 00:01:14.226
that I've always loved the night sky.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.167
I'm kind of a walking clichÃ©.

00:01:18.792 --> 00:01:21.309
But when I was growing up in Minnesota,

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:24.434
one of my favorite things to do
on a summer evening

00:01:24.458 --> 00:01:27.101
was grab my old Raggedy Ann sleeping bag

00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:29.434
and take it out into a field
behind my house,

00:01:29.458 --> 00:01:32.934
where I would spend hours
looking at the night sky.

00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:36.101
And to do this, I had to brave
not only the darkness,

00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:38.559
but also swarms of mosquitoes,

00:01:38.583 --> 00:01:41.851
and my sleeping bag
really didn't smell very good.

00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:43.583
(Laughter)

00:01:44.708 --> 00:01:47.351
But there was one particular star

00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:49.518
that I would look for, night after night.

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:51.268
And then I would play this game

00:01:51.292 --> 00:01:55.559
where I would try to focus
on that star so intensely,

00:01:55.583 --> 00:01:57.934
that everything else
would fade from my view

00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.893
and that single star
would be all that I could see.

00:02:00.917 --> 00:02:03.018
I could only ever hold on to that focus

00:02:03.042 --> 00:02:05.559
for a few fleeting moments.

00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:06.934
But when I did,

00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:10.809
I felt this deep sense
of connection to the universe.

00:02:10.833 --> 00:02:14.184
And almost a sense of vertigo,

00:02:14.208 --> 00:02:17.125
like I was going to fall into space.

00:02:18.292 --> 00:02:20.143
And when this happened --

00:02:20.167 --> 00:02:22.018
I know this sounds kind of ridiculous,

00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:27.976
but I would simultaneously feel
unfathomably insignificant

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.625
and also kind of weirdly important.

00:02:31.458 --> 00:02:35.684
That star I looked to
night after night was called Vega.

00:02:35.708 --> 00:02:39.434
Vega is the brightest star
in the constellation Lyra,

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:42.226
which is not coincidentally
the name of one of my dogs.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.726
(Laughter)

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.559
But this experience is being lost.

00:02:47.583 --> 00:02:49.851
My favorite constellation, Lyra,

00:02:49.875 --> 00:02:52.066
this is what it would look like
from Manhattan.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.684
For people who live in urban
and suburban environments,

00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:57.351
if they go outside at night and look up,

00:02:57.375 --> 00:03:02.101
instead of being awestruck
by the majesty of the universe,

00:03:02.125 --> 00:03:04.167
they see pretty much nothing.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.143
These unremarkable,
completely blank night skies,

00:03:10.167 --> 00:03:13.976
of course are due to all of the light
we produce at night.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.559
Those very same lights
we see all the way from space

00:03:16.583 --> 00:03:18.559
are shining up into the atmosphere,

00:03:18.583 --> 00:03:23.768
where they bounce around
and create this featureless smog of light.

00:03:23.792 --> 00:03:26.226
And that featureless
smog of light has a name.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.476
It's called light pollution.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.768
As an astronomer,

00:03:29.792 --> 00:03:32.476
I can actually tell
how bad light pollution is

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.059
by the brightness of stars
I can see in the sky.

00:03:35.083 --> 00:03:36.351
And it turns out

00:03:36.375 --> 00:03:39.601
that when you're trying to unlock
the secrets of the cosmos,

00:03:39.625 --> 00:03:43.434
it's really helpful
to be able to see the cosmos.

00:03:43.458 --> 00:03:44.708
And --

00:03:44.833 --> 00:03:45.833
[Laughs]

00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.208
Truth.

00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:50.643
And this light that we're trying to detect

00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:54.809
is coming from millions or billions
of light-years away,

00:03:54.833 --> 00:03:58.059
and so it's generally pretty faint.

00:03:58.083 --> 00:03:59.851
And as an astronomer,

00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:02.351
I fight with this every day to do my job,

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:06.000
and I have to tell you,
it is a really big problem.

00:04:08.917 --> 00:04:11.976
But the problem is far worse

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.226
than just losing some
whimsical ability to gaze at the stars.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.518
For example,

00:04:18.542 --> 00:04:21.476
countless plant and animal
species are affected.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.643
So we could talk about sea turtles

00:04:24.667 --> 00:04:27.101
or pollinators

00:04:27.125 --> 00:04:30.101
or any of these super important species

00:04:30.125 --> 00:04:32.434
that are also cute.

00:04:32.458 --> 00:04:33.726
Instead, I want to talk

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.184
about these quietly unassuming dog whelks.

00:04:37.208 --> 00:04:38.601
You may have seen them around

00:04:38.625 --> 00:04:41.351
and not given them
really a whole lot of thought.

00:04:41.375 --> 00:04:42.643
But they're pretty cool.

00:04:42.667 --> 00:04:44.601
So in an entire year

00:04:44.625 --> 00:04:48.893
a dog whelk will rarely move
more than about 10 meters.

00:04:48.917 --> 00:04:52.809
That means that when
they are attacking their prey

00:04:52.833 --> 00:04:55.792
they can hit this brisk pace
of about a millimeter an hour.

00:04:56.708 --> 00:04:57.976
And --

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
(Laughter)

00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:02.768
This works out OK,

00:05:02.792 --> 00:05:05.393
because they attack things like barnacles.

00:05:05.417 --> 00:05:09.125
(Laughter)

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.934
So these dog whelks live
in the intertidal area of coasts,

00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.226
where, it turns out,

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.309
they're a pretty key part
of the ecosystem.

00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:23.143
Not only are they one of the most
dominant invertebrate predators,

00:05:23.167 --> 00:05:28.226
but other animals, like crabs and birds,
think they're pretty tasty.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.643
So that leaves these poor snails
in a kind of precarious situation,

00:05:31.667 --> 00:05:34.059
because if they go too low in the water,

00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:35.893
then crabs are a threat,

00:05:35.917 --> 00:05:38.018
but if they come out of the water too far,

00:05:38.042 --> 00:05:39.667
birds are going to have a feast.

00:05:41.083 --> 00:05:43.625
Why is an astronomer
telling you about dog whelks?

00:05:45.083 --> 00:05:46.333
I ask that myself.

00:05:47.833 --> 00:05:50.976
Because their behavior
is impacted by light pollution.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.268
For example,

00:05:52.292 --> 00:05:55.518
if dog whelks are subjected
to artificial light at night

00:05:55.542 --> 00:05:59.768
they're about twice as likely
to stay under the water with a predator.

00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:01.684
And that puts them at increased risk.

00:06:01.708 --> 00:06:03.976
And it's not like they can make
a speedy escape.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.268
And so these --

00:06:05.292 --> 00:06:06.542
(Laughter)

00:06:07.292 --> 00:06:09.726
And the other issue
is because they literally move

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.559
at a snail's pace.

00:06:11.583 --> 00:06:14.268
If a population is wiped out,

00:06:14.292 --> 00:06:17.226
it can take decades to replenish.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.809
And that, in turn, affects
the rest of their ecosystem

00:06:19.833 --> 00:06:23.851
and the other species, like the birds
and the barnacles and the crabs.

00:06:23.875 --> 00:06:27.101
So this is just one
small and slimy example

00:06:27.125 --> 00:06:30.518
of how light pollution
can unleash a cascade effect

00:06:30.542 --> 00:06:32.893
on an entire ecosystem.

00:06:32.917 --> 00:06:37.351
Virtually every species
that has been studied to date

00:06:37.375 --> 00:06:39.184
is impacted by light pollution.

00:06:39.208 --> 00:06:40.559
And that includes humans.

00:06:40.583 --> 00:06:42.601
So let's talk about us.

00:06:42.625 --> 00:06:45.018
You are probably not surprised to hear

00:06:45.042 --> 00:06:48.934
that light pollution can affect
your ability to sleep well at night.

00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:52.917
But you might be surprised to hear
that light pollution is linked to obesity.

00:06:54.167 --> 00:06:55.518
In fact, in a recent study

00:06:55.542 --> 00:06:58.893
they found that light pollution
contributed to over 70 percent

00:06:58.917 --> 00:07:01.542
of the obesity rates in 80 countries.

00:07:02.375 --> 00:07:03.684
More than that,

00:07:03.708 --> 00:07:07.851
light pollution actually contributed
about the same amount to excess weight

00:07:07.875 --> 00:07:09.208
as eating junk food.

00:07:10.458 --> 00:07:12.018
And it gets worse.

00:07:12.042 --> 00:07:14.018
For people who are subjected

00:07:14.042 --> 00:07:16.976
to significant amounts
of artificial light at night

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.101
they're about 50 percent more likely
to get breast cancer.

00:07:21.125 --> 00:07:24.351
And in fact, light pollution
is correlated with types of cancer

00:07:24.375 --> 00:07:25.726
across the board.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.393
And in controlled lab experiments

00:07:27.417 --> 00:07:31.893
there's a direct link between
increased artificial light at night

00:07:31.917 --> 00:07:33.708
and a rate of tumor growth.

00:07:34.792 --> 00:07:37.643
You might be wondering how normal light

00:07:37.667 --> 00:07:40.934
could possibly impact cancer rates.

00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.768
It likely all comes down
to the super important hormone

00:07:43.792 --> 00:07:45.559
called melatonin,

00:07:45.583 --> 00:07:47.851
which we have evolved
over millions of years

00:07:47.875 --> 00:07:51.768
to produce on a day-night cycle,
or a circadian rhythm.

00:07:51.792 --> 00:07:54.309
What happens is that when light impacts

00:07:54.333 --> 00:07:56.518
the retina at the back of our eye at night

00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:59.059
it can disrupt melatonin production,

00:07:59.083 --> 00:08:01.351
and when melatonin
production is disrupted,

00:08:01.375 --> 00:08:04.226
a whole chain of other
chemical processes are affected,

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.393
and that includes estrogen production.

00:08:06.417 --> 00:08:09.143
And when we throw
this chemical balance out of whack,

00:08:09.167 --> 00:08:11.018
really bad things can happen.

00:08:11.042 --> 00:08:12.684
In fact, things are so bad,

00:08:12.708 --> 00:08:15.518
that the International Agency
for Cancer Research

00:08:15.542 --> 00:08:18.851
has said that disrupting
the human circadian rhythm

00:08:18.875 --> 00:08:20.750
is a probable carcinogen.

00:08:22.292 --> 00:08:24.101
Also, for fun, I want to let you know

00:08:24.125 --> 00:08:26.059
that light pollution has been linked to,

00:08:26.083 --> 00:08:29.143
let's see -- headaches, anxiety,
depression, diabetes,

00:08:29.167 --> 00:08:31.434
cardiovascular disease
and the list goes on.

00:08:31.458 --> 00:08:33.768
But maybe you don't care
about your health.

00:08:33.792 --> 00:08:35.226
We're all going to die anyway,

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.518
you might as well die
in a brightly lit room.

00:08:37.542 --> 00:08:40.184
(Laughter)

00:08:40.208 --> 00:08:43.143
The fact that you're laughing
about death is kind of amazing.

00:08:43.167 --> 00:08:44.333
(Laughter)

00:08:45.208 --> 00:08:47.125
You might still care about money.

00:08:48.083 --> 00:08:50.268
The money that's spent
on that wasted light,

00:08:50.292 --> 00:08:53.226
and I mean just the light
that's going out into the universe,

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:54.518
and not doing us any good,

00:08:54.542 --> 00:08:56.393
is three billion dollars a year.

00:08:56.417 --> 00:08:58.434
That's enough money to build, like,

00:08:58.458 --> 00:09:01.018
1,000 utility-grade windmills,

00:09:01.042 --> 00:09:05.309
or fund the entire DC public-school
system for over two years,

00:09:05.333 --> 00:09:07.809
or -- this is my favorite,
because I really want one

00:09:07.833 --> 00:09:09.476
but I can't afford one --

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.351
buy 30,000 Tesla Model X SUVs.

00:09:12.375 --> 00:09:14.393
(Laughter)

00:09:14.417 --> 00:09:16.667
And that includes
the electric car tax credit.

00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:21.976
And then there are the existential costs.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.268
I don't have any data

00:09:24.292 --> 00:09:27.893
on how losing touch
with our place in the cosmos

00:09:27.917 --> 00:09:29.768
impacts us.

00:09:29.792 --> 00:09:32.351
But I believe

00:09:32.375 --> 00:09:34.434
that this probably impacts our humanity

00:09:34.458 --> 00:09:37.976
more than any of the other
scary statistics I can share with you.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.601
And it's getting worse with time.

00:09:39.625 --> 00:09:45.226
The amount of light pollution
is doubling roughly every 35 years.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.518
That means that within the next decade

00:09:48.542 --> 00:09:52.101
virtually the entire eastern half
of the United States

00:09:52.125 --> 00:09:55.083
will be perpetually brighter
than twilight.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.018
And there's another issue
with light pollution.

00:09:59.042 --> 00:10:02.143
The problem is way worse
than we can see with our own eyes.

00:10:02.167 --> 00:10:04.976
Our eyes have evolved
to just detect this tiny range

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.101
of the full spectrum of light.

00:10:07.125 --> 00:10:09.476
All of this other light that we can't see,

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.559
this invisible light,

00:10:11.583 --> 00:10:13.226
also has a pollution problem.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:14.976
Mostly it's from modern technology,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.351
things like cell phones
or car-to-car radar,

00:10:17.375 --> 00:10:20.583
or now apparently we need appliances
that can talk to each other.

00:10:21.792 --> 00:10:24.809
All of this modern technology
is putting out strong signals

00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:26.976
that can completely swamp

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.768
this exceedingly faint light
we're trying to detect

00:10:30.792 --> 00:10:32.934
from the rest of the universe
outside Earth,

00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.792
which just for the record,
is most of the universe.

00:10:36.708 --> 00:10:40.167
(Laughter)

00:10:42.083 --> 00:10:44.351
And then, there are satellites.

00:10:44.375 --> 00:10:48.518
Satellites are a problem at both
visible and invisible wavelengths.

00:10:48.542 --> 00:10:52.726
A host of private companies have plans
to deploy tens of thousands of satellites

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.518
into Earth orbit,

00:10:54.542 --> 00:10:56.601
where they will not only outnumber,

00:10:56.625 --> 00:11:00.018
literally outnumber
the visible stars in the sky,

00:11:00.042 --> 00:11:04.393
while also beaming
invisible light back to Earth.

00:11:04.417 --> 00:11:06.351
So for astronomers like me,

00:11:06.375 --> 00:11:08.851
who use invisible light
to study the universe,

00:11:08.875 --> 00:11:11.934
it's going to be like staring at the Sun

00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.375
and trying to see
a birthday candle behind it.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.934
Alright, I want to be clear

00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:22.101
that there's nothing inherently wrong
with any of this modern technology.

00:11:22.125 --> 00:11:25.393
With cell phones
or satellites or car radar.

00:11:25.417 --> 00:11:27.601
I'm not sure about kitchen appliances.

00:11:27.625 --> 00:11:28.976
(Laughter)

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.268
I haven't broken down

00:11:30.292 --> 00:11:32.934
and gotten an oven
that talks to my cell phone yet.

00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.708
And I use lights at night
like everybody else.

00:11:37.583 --> 00:11:39.309
But here's the thing.

00:11:39.333 --> 00:11:41.309
Some problems in the world,

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:43.976
like we've heard about today
and you'll hear more about,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.809
are overwhelming
and they seem intractable.

00:11:47.833 --> 00:11:51.559
Visible light pollution
is not one of these problems.

00:11:51.583 --> 00:11:54.893
This is actually stupidly simple, OK?

00:11:54.917 --> 00:11:58.643
So here are five
super simple things you can do.

00:11:58.667 --> 00:12:01.559
Don't use lights
brighter than you need to.

00:12:01.583 --> 00:12:04.018
Don't use lights when you don't need them.

00:12:04.042 --> 00:12:05.309
Those lights you're using,

00:12:05.333 --> 00:12:06.934
make sure they're shielded down,

00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.101
so they're not shining up into the sky.

00:12:09.125 --> 00:12:11.226
And let's talk about LED lights.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:15.559
If you have a choice,
don't buy the blue ones.

00:12:15.583 --> 00:12:18.309
Look for words like "warm white."

00:12:18.333 --> 00:12:22.476
If you buy LEDs with words like
"natural light" or "daylight,"

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.518
that's like saying you hate space.

00:12:24.542 --> 00:12:30.809
(Laughter)

00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:33.351
And finally,

00:12:33.375 --> 00:12:35.309
you could advocate for this.

00:12:35.333 --> 00:12:36.768
Even in your local community,

00:12:36.792 --> 00:12:38.476
find out if there's a lighting code

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.351
and whether it could be made
more night-sky friendly.

00:12:41.375 --> 00:12:44.934
Or dare I say, you could even advocate
at the federal level,

00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.476
by politely asking our federal officials,

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.768
some of whom may be here,

00:12:48.792 --> 00:12:53.018
to please not auction off
our view of the invisible universe

00:12:53.042 --> 00:12:55.018
to the highest bidder to pollute at will,

00:12:55.042 --> 00:12:57.476
which is actually what happens.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.268
Now, like a good professor,

00:13:00.292 --> 00:13:01.917
I have homework for you.

00:13:02.917 --> 00:13:07.268
If you have never seen
a truly dark night sky,

00:13:07.292 --> 00:13:11.268
I want you to go out
and experience one for yourself.

00:13:11.292 --> 00:13:13.268
Because if you don't,

00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:16.309
you don't know what you're missing,

00:13:16.333 --> 00:13:19.809
and you don't know
what humanity is losing.

00:13:19.833 --> 00:13:21.101
Thank you.

00:13:21.125 --> 00:13:24.125
(Applause)
