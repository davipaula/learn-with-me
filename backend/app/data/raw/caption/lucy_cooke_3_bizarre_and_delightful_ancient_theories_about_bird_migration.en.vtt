00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.050
In May of 1822, 
Count Christian Ludwig von Bothmer

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.739
shot down a stork over his castle
grounds in North Germany.

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:23.024
However, he wasn’t the first person
to hunt that specific bird.

00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:25.064
Upon recovering the stork,

00:00:25.064 --> 00:00:30.213
von Bothmer found it impaled 
by a yard long wooden spear.

00:00:30.213 --> 00:00:34.464
A local professor determined 
the weapon was African in origin,

00:00:34.464 --> 00:00:38.652
suggesting that somehow, 
this stork was speared in Africa

00:00:38.652 --> 00:00:44.007
and then flew over 2,500 kilometers 
to the count’s castle.

00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:48.706
This astonishing flight wasn’t just
evidence of the stork’s resilience.

00:00:48.706 --> 00:00:54.583
It was an essential clue in a mystery
that plagued scientists for centuries:

00:00:54.583 --> 00:00:57.653
the seasonal disappearance of birds.

00:00:57.653 --> 00:01:02.538
Ancient naturalists had various theories
to explain the annual vanishing act

00:01:02.538 --> 00:01:05.608
we now know as migration.

00:01:05.608 --> 00:01:11.044
Aristotle himself proposed 
three particularly popular ideas.

00:01:11.044 --> 00:01:16.749
One theory was that birds transformed into
different bodies that suited the season.

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:20.149
For example, summer time garden warblers

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.149
were believed to transform 
into black caps every winter.

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.922
In reality these are two distinct species—
similar in shape and size,

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:31.912
but never appearing at the same time.

00:01:31.912 --> 00:01:36.404
Over the following centuries, birds 
were said to morph into humans,

00:01:36.404 --> 00:01:40.074
plants, and even the timbers of ships.

00:01:40.074 --> 00:01:45.437
This last transmutation was especially
popular with many Christian clergy.

00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:48.477
If barnacle geese were truly made of wood,

00:01:48.477 --> 00:01:54.408
they could be deemed vegetarian 
and enjoyed during meatless fasts.

00:01:54.408 --> 00:02:00.079
Aristotle’s second and even more enduring
hypothesis was that birds hibernate.

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.209
This isn’t so far-fetched.

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:04.549
Some species do enter short,

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.549
deep sleeps which lower their heart rates
and metabolisms.

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.329
And there’s at least one truly 
hibernating bird:

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:16.937
the common poorwill sleeps out winters
in the deserts of North America.

00:02:16.937 --> 00:02:21.341
But researchers were proposing much more
outlandish forms of hibernation

00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:23.971
well into the 19th century.

00:02:23.971 --> 00:02:29.019
Barn swallows were said to remove 
their feathers and hibernate in holes,

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.588
or sleep through the winter at the bottom
of lakes and rivers.

00:02:33.588 --> 00:02:36.948
Aristotle’s final theory 
was much more reasonable,

00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:40.368
and resembled something
like realistic migration.

00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:44.504
However, this idea was also taken 
to extremes.

00:02:44.504 --> 00:02:50.762
In 1666, the leading migration advocate
was convinced that each winter,

00:02:50.762 --> 00:02:52.892
birds flew to the moon.

00:02:52.892 --> 00:02:58.081
It might seem strange that prominent 
researchers considered such bizarre ideas.

00:02:58.081 --> 00:03:01.138
But to be fair, the true story 
of migration

00:03:01.138 --> 00:03:05.178
may be even harder
to believe than their wildest theories.

00:03:05.178 --> 00:03:09.309
Roughly 20% of all bird species 
migrate each year,

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:12.989
following warm weather and fresh food
around the planet.

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.439
For birds who spend their summers
in the northern hemisphere,

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:22.214
this journey can span 
from 700 to over 17,000 kilometers,

00:03:22.214 --> 00:03:26.364
with some flights lasting as long
as four months.

00:03:26.364 --> 00:03:32.995
Birds who migrate across oceans may soar
without stopping for over 100 hours.

00:03:32.995 --> 00:03:37.445
Sleeping and eating on the fly, 
they navigate the endless ocean

00:03:37.445 --> 00:03:42.355
by the stars, wind currents, 
and Earth’s magnetic field.

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:47.133
Tracking the specifics of these epic
expeditions is notoriously difficult.

00:03:47.133 --> 00:03:51.133
And while birds often take 
the most direct route possible,

00:03:51.133 --> 00:03:54.733
storms and human development
can alter their paths,

00:03:54.733 --> 00:03:58.573
further complicating our attempts
to chart migration.

00:03:58.573 --> 00:04:02.986
Fortunately, Count von Bothmer’s stork
offered physical proof

00:04:02.986 --> 00:04:06.986
not only that European storks were
migrating south for the winter,

00:04:06.986 --> 00:04:10.186
but also where they were migrating to.

00:04:10.186 --> 00:04:12.296
Ornithologists across the continent

00:04:12.296 --> 00:04:15.436
were eager to map the trajectory
of this flight,

00:04:15.436 --> 00:04:18.446
including Johannes Thienemann.

00:04:18.446 --> 00:04:22.316
Owner of the world’s first permanent
bird observatory,

00:04:22.316 --> 00:04:26.446
Thienemann was a major public advocate
for the study of birds.

00:04:26.446 --> 00:04:28.866
And to solve the field’s biggest mystery,

00:04:28.866 --> 00:04:32.866
he wrangled an army of volunteers
from across Germany.

00:04:32.866 --> 00:04:38.823
His team used aluminum rings to tag
the legs of two thousand storks

00:04:38.823 --> 00:04:42.823
with unique numbers and the address
of his offices.

00:04:42.823 --> 00:04:47.452
Then he advertised the initiative 
as widely as possible.

00:04:47.452 --> 00:04:51.590
His hope was that word of the experiment
would find its way to Africa,

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:57.109
so people finding the tags would know
to mail them back with more information.

00:04:57.109 --> 00:05:00.959
Sure enough, from 1908 to 1913,

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:07.998
Thienemann received 178 rings, 
48 of which had been found in Africa.

00:05:07.998 --> 00:05:13.013
Using this data, he plotted the first
migration route ever discovered,

00:05:13.013 --> 00:05:18.033
and definitively established that storks
were not, in fact, flying to the moon.
