00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:16.301
So, of all my childhood memories,

00:00:16.325 --> 00:00:19.317
there is one that stands above the rest.

00:00:19.698 --> 00:00:22.958
And that is the time that my brave parents

00:00:22.982 --> 00:00:25.799
rented an RV, packed it
with me and my brothers,

00:00:25.823 --> 00:00:28.172
and drove west
from our house in Minneapolis,

00:00:28.196 --> 00:00:30.463
out to Yellowstone National Park.

00:00:31.188 --> 00:00:34.737
We saw all the sights, like the geysers,
we stopped at the Badlands,

00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:39.347
but more than any of the places,
I remember this as an adventure.

00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:43.157
This was my introduction to the Wild West.

00:00:43.974 --> 00:00:46.617
But it wasn't until I got older

00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:50.513
and I learned more
about the National Park System

00:00:50.537 --> 00:00:53.244
that I realized just how lucky I was.

00:00:53.268 --> 00:00:55.054
One, to have that experience,

00:00:55.078 --> 00:00:57.754
but also that, hundreds of years ago,

00:00:57.778 --> 00:01:03.656
people had the foresight
to set aside the very best places,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.577
the very best ecosystems
in the country, for everyone.

00:01:09.125 --> 00:01:10.688
And for future generations.

00:01:11.046 --> 00:01:17.260
And to really appreciate
just how prescient that idea was,

00:01:17.284 --> 00:01:18.458
you have to go back

00:01:18.482 --> 00:01:21.648
and you have to look at the history
of the National Parks Service.

00:01:21.672 --> 00:01:26.219
So, a lot of people know, the first
national park was Yellowstone, in 1872.

00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:29.783
A lot of people think of John Muir,
the poet, naturalist,

00:01:29.807 --> 00:01:31.342
who was such a visionary

00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:34.783
in getting people inspired
by the idea of conservation --

00:01:34.807 --> 00:01:38.522
that we need to take
the best places and protect them.

00:01:38.546 --> 00:01:41.291
He had an audience in very high places --

00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:44.459
there's a great story
of Teddy Roosevelt and John Muir

00:01:44.483 --> 00:01:47.737
going hiking, in Yosemite,
during his presidency,

00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:51.014
four days, completely off the grid,
just the two of them.

00:01:51.038 --> 00:01:53.111
Can you imagine a president

00:01:53.135 --> 00:01:55.894
actually just going completely
off the grid for four days?

00:01:56.284 --> 00:01:57.609
(Laughter)

00:01:57.633 --> 00:01:58.791
No tweeting.

00:01:58.815 --> 00:02:02.609
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:03.881
Like that idea.

00:02:03.905 --> 00:02:04.905
(Applause)

00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:12.545
But he had a great impact
on Theodore Roosevelt.

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.213
And he created dozens of national parks,

00:02:15.237 --> 00:02:19.164
hundreds of thousands of square acres
of national wildlife refuges.

00:02:19.188 --> 00:02:23.839
It was an important administration,
but it wasn't a done deal.

00:02:23.863 --> 00:02:29.561
Even less than 10 years
after he created all of those new places,

00:02:29.585 --> 00:02:32.220
the future of those places
was very much in doubt.

00:02:32.847 --> 00:02:35.994
And it wasn't until this guy,
Stephen Mather,

00:02:36.018 --> 00:02:37.633
a businessman from Chicago,

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:40.879
wrote an angry letter
to the Department of the Interior, saying,

00:02:40.903 --> 00:02:45.227
"You guys aren't doing a good enough job
protecting and preserving these places."

00:02:45.736 --> 00:02:47.363
Then, something was done about it.

00:02:47.387 --> 00:02:49.553
The Department of the Interior
wrote him back.

00:02:49.577 --> 00:02:52.014
"Mr. Mather, if you care
so much about this,

00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:54.982
why don't you come to Washington
and do it yourself?"

00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:56.117
(Laughter)

00:02:56.141 --> 00:02:57.918
And he did.

00:02:57.942 --> 00:03:00.204
He took a job at the Department
of the Interior,

00:03:00.228 --> 00:03:03.784
but more importantly,
he started a campaign.

00:03:04.304 --> 00:03:09.082
He actually had a meeting
two blocks from here, in 1914,

00:03:09.106 --> 00:03:10.439
in California Hall,

00:03:10.463 --> 00:03:13.845
and he brought together the park
superintendents and a few other people

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:16.669
who cared about this idea of conservation.

00:03:17.601 --> 00:03:21.537
And they put together a plan,
they hatched a campaign

00:03:21.561 --> 00:03:26.006
that eventually led to the
National Park Service in 1916.

00:03:26.744 --> 00:03:28.078
And that's really important.

00:03:28.102 --> 00:03:32.103
Because it went from an idea
that we should protect these places

00:03:32.127 --> 00:03:33.619
to an actual plan,

00:03:33.643 --> 00:03:37.683
a way for people to enlist
and carry that idea forward

00:03:37.707 --> 00:03:38.981
for future generations,

00:03:39.005 --> 00:03:43.045
so little kids like me can go
and have these amazing experiences.

00:03:43.514 --> 00:03:46.914
That is the history
of the National Parks on land.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.236
The ocean, what I want
to talk to you about today,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.037
is a completely different story.

00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:55.779
And we are almost precisely
100 years behind.

00:03:56.323 --> 00:03:59.076
So, the first marine
sanctuary was in 1972,

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.147
after the oil spill in Santa Barbara,

00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:04.878
people got interested
in taking that concept

00:04:04.902 --> 00:04:08.156
and applying it
to underwater environments.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.266
We've had our own John Muir,
who's Dr. Sylvia Earle,

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.189
who's been a tireless advocate

00:04:13.213 --> 00:04:16.529
for creating these marine
protected areas around the world.

00:04:16.553 --> 00:04:19.752
So, I know there's a lot
of bad news about the ocean,

00:04:19.776 --> 00:04:22.892
there's plastic pollution,
coral bleaching, over-fishing --

00:04:22.916 --> 00:04:25.821
it's hard to take it all in sometimes.

00:04:25.845 --> 00:04:31.276
But this idea of setting aside
places for nature is working.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.450
Science tells us that if you
set these places aside,

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:37.617
nature will come back
and we can keep the oceans healthy.

00:04:37.641 --> 00:04:39.743
So we know this idea works.

00:04:40.141 --> 00:04:44.093
And Dr. Sylvia Earl
has been influential, like John Muir,

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:45.291
with administrations --

00:04:45.315 --> 00:04:49.172
George W. Bush and Obama
were both fantastic ocean presidents,

00:04:49.196 --> 00:04:52.579
creating marine protected areas
all around the country.

00:04:53.173 --> 00:04:56.442
This is not a conservative idea
or a liberal idea,

00:04:56.466 --> 00:04:58.244
it's not even an American idea,

00:04:58.268 --> 00:05:00.204
it's just a good idea.

00:05:00.673 --> 00:05:01.926
(Laughter)

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.561
(Applause)

00:05:03.585 --> 00:05:04.766
But --

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.053
(Applause)

00:05:06.077 --> 00:05:08.401
Here we are, a few years later.

00:05:08.751 --> 00:05:13.830
And now the administration is proposing
to roll back a lot of the progress

00:05:13.854 --> 00:05:15.780
we've made in the past 20 years.

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.568
So, so, don't mourn -- organize.

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:23.722
We need to do what
Stephen Mather did 100 years ago.

00:05:23.746 --> 00:05:28.049
We need to start a campaign
to get people engaged with this idea.

00:05:28.365 --> 00:05:32.745
And I think we need a league
of citizen scientists for the ocean.

00:05:33.486 --> 00:05:37.351
And I've seen glimpses of this future,
and I know that it's possible.

00:05:37.375 --> 00:05:40.880
My friend Erik and I started building
underwater robots,

00:05:40.904 --> 00:05:44.838
these little swimming cameras
with lights that you can see underwater.

00:05:44.862 --> 00:05:47.544
We started building these
in his garage five years ago,

00:05:47.568 --> 00:05:48.908
and we've watched that grow

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:52.283
into this community of thousands
of people around the world,

00:05:52.307 --> 00:05:55.220
who believe that everybody
should have access to these places.

00:05:55.244 --> 00:05:57.720
We all deserve the tools
to go and explore.

00:05:58.076 --> 00:05:59.668
There's stories like Laura James,

00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:03.188
who used her robot to find out that
sea stars in her area were dying.

00:06:03.212 --> 00:06:06.299
And she started this whole
citizen science campaign,

00:06:06.323 --> 00:06:09.466
collected data and drove awareness
for sea-star wasting syndrome,

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.514
to try and figure out
what was happening there.

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:14.673
There are stories of fishermen in Mexico,

00:06:14.697 --> 00:06:17.418
who used the robot to create
marine protected areas

00:06:17.442 --> 00:06:22.283
where Nassau grouper were spawning,
to protect the future of this species.

00:06:22.307 --> 00:06:23.831
It's really amazing stuff.

00:06:23.855 --> 00:06:26.799
We found that if you give
people the tools,

00:06:26.823 --> 00:06:28.513
they'll do the right thing.

00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:33.196
But we need to take it a step further.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.125
And, actually, I think we can dust off
Stephen Mather's playbook.

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:38.350
So what did he do?

00:06:38.374 --> 00:06:41.918
So, the first thing that he did
was he focused on infrastructure.

00:06:41.942 --> 00:06:44.704
So 1914 wasn't just
a time for the parks,

00:06:44.728 --> 00:06:46.943
it was also a time for the automobile,

00:06:46.967 --> 00:06:48.983
the Model T was rolling off the line,

00:06:49.007 --> 00:06:51.188
and Stephen Mather understood

00:06:51.212 --> 00:06:54.220
that this was going to be
an important part of American culture.

00:06:54.244 --> 00:06:57.363
And so he partnered with highway
associations around the country

00:06:57.387 --> 00:07:00.871
to build big, beautiful highways
out to these parks.

00:07:00.895 --> 00:07:04.349
And it worked, he's basically
invented car camping.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.252
And he knew that if people
didn't go to these places,

00:07:08.276 --> 00:07:11.332
that they wouldn’t fall in love with them
and they wouldn't care.

00:07:11.356 --> 00:07:13.849
So that was a really insightful
idea that he had.

00:07:14.474 --> 00:07:15.934
The second thing they did,

00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.006
was they focused
on visionary philanthropy.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:21.617
So, Stephen Mather was a successful
businessman from Chicago,

00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:24.849
and anytime there was
a parks association that needed funding,

00:07:24.873 --> 00:07:27.730
anytime there was a highway
association that needed funding,

00:07:27.754 --> 00:07:30.071
they'd step in, write
the checks, make it happen.

00:07:30.095 --> 00:07:32.453
There's a great story
of his friend William Kent,

00:07:32.477 --> 00:07:37.409
who recognized there was a small patch
of redwoods left on the base of Mount Tam,

00:07:37.433 --> 00:07:39.093
and so he quickly bought the land

00:07:39.117 --> 00:07:41.346
and donated it
to this National Parks effort.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:42.695
That's Muir Woods today --

00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:45.822
it's one of the most popular
national parks in the whole country.

00:07:45.846 --> 00:07:48.128
My parents are visiting here
from Minnesota,

00:07:48.152 --> 00:07:50.421
and they don't really even
care about this talk,

00:07:50.445 --> 00:07:52.806
all they're talking about
is going to Muir Woods.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.881
(Laughter)

00:07:55.659 --> 00:07:57.299
But the last thing is critical --

00:07:57.323 --> 00:07:59.728
Stephen Mather focused on engagement.

00:07:59.752 --> 00:08:04.220
In one of the first meetings that they had
around this new system, he said,

00:08:04.244 --> 00:08:06.712
"If you're a writer,
I want you to write about this.

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:10.601
If you're a business owner, I want you
to tell your clubs and your organizations.

00:08:10.625 --> 00:08:13.611
If you work for the government,
I want you to pass regulation."

00:08:13.635 --> 00:08:14.895
Everybody had a job.

00:08:14.919 --> 00:08:17.042
"Each of you, all of you,
have a role to play

00:08:17.066 --> 00:08:19.518
in protecting these places
for future generations."

00:08:20.161 --> 00:08:22.248
Each of you, all of you.

00:08:23.154 --> 00:08:24.304
I love that.

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.601
That's the plan --
simple, three-point plan.

00:08:29.585 --> 00:08:31.387
I think we can do the same.

00:08:31.411 --> 00:08:33.494
So, this was the headline
when Obama created

00:08:33.518 --> 00:08:37.276
the Papahanaumokuakea National Monument:

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.165
"Lots to see, but good luck
trying to get there."

00:08:40.593 --> 00:08:45.307
But like Mather, we should focus
on the technology of our time,

00:08:45.331 --> 00:08:48.168
all of this new, amazing,
digital infrastructure

00:08:48.192 --> 00:08:51.404
can be built to engage people
with the oceans.

00:08:51.751 --> 00:08:56.133
So, the National Marine Sanctuary

00:08:56.157 --> 00:08:59.863
has created all these
wonderful VR 360 videos,

00:08:59.887 --> 00:09:03.021
where you can actually go
and see what these places look like.

00:09:03.395 --> 00:09:05.850
Our team is continuing to build new tools,

00:09:05.874 --> 00:09:08.729
this is our latest, this is
the trident underwater drone,

00:09:08.753 --> 00:09:12.348
it's a diving submarine, it's sleek,
you can fit it in a backpack,

00:09:12.372 --> 00:09:15.469
it can go down to 100 meters,
deeper than most divers can go.

00:09:15.796 --> 00:09:19.999
It can see these environments
that most people have never had access to.

00:09:21.006 --> 00:09:24.473
New tools are coming
and we need even better tools.

00:09:25.839 --> 00:09:29.426
We can also use
more visionary philanthropists.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.347
So, when Erik and I started this,
we didn't have any money,

00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:34.771
we were building this in his garage.

00:09:35.163 --> 00:09:36.594
But we went to Kickstarter.

00:09:36.618 --> 00:09:38.201
And we found over 1,800 people,

00:09:38.225 --> 00:09:40.721
almost a million dollars
we've raised on Kickstarter,

00:09:40.745 --> 00:09:42.346
finding other people who think,

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:43.849
"Yeah, that's a good idea.

00:09:43.873 --> 00:09:45.378
I want to be a part of that."

00:09:45.712 --> 00:09:48.736
We need more ways for people
to get engaged

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.479
and become visionary
philanthropists themselves.

00:09:51.503 --> 00:09:53.516
We've also had
traditional philanthropists,

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:54.885
who've stepped up to fund us

00:09:54.909 --> 00:09:58.131
in the SEE initiative --
the Science Education and Exploration,

00:09:58.155 --> 00:10:02.969
who are going to help us get donated
units out to people on the frontlines,

00:10:02.993 --> 00:10:06.255
people who are doing the science,
people who are telling the stories,

00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:07.715
inspiring communities.

00:10:07.739 --> 00:10:11.032
You can go on to OpenExplorer.com
and see what people are doing,

00:10:11.056 --> 00:10:13.104
it's hugely inspirational.

00:10:14.119 --> 00:10:16.818
And it will also, hopefully,
spur you to get involved.

00:10:16.842 --> 00:10:20.517
Because there is plenty of room
to get involved.

00:10:20.541 --> 00:10:24.415
We want to hear what ideas you have
for telling these stories.

00:10:25.529 --> 00:10:28.116
Because that's just it --
this is all about engagement.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.997
There's all sorts of interesting,
new ways for people to participate

00:10:32.021 --> 00:10:33.870
in the protection of these places.

00:10:33.894 --> 00:10:35.188
And the understanding.

00:10:35.212 --> 00:10:38.597
Like, Reef Check -- scuba divers
are going down and swimming transects

00:10:38.621 --> 00:10:42.109
and counting fish and biodiversity data.

00:10:42.133 --> 00:10:45.533
They're getting the information we need
to protect these places.

00:10:45.911 --> 00:10:49.306
If you're going down to the beach,
participate in MPA Watch.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:53.014
Document what activities you see
going on in these different areas.

00:10:53.038 --> 00:10:56.304
There is room for everybody
to participate here.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.410
And that's just it, that's what we need.

00:10:59.434 --> 00:11:03.283
We need to build a future
for our grandkids' grandkids.

00:11:03.307 --> 00:11:05.552
Last month, I went out sailing,

00:11:05.576 --> 00:11:09.149
and we got out to the Farallon Islands,
25 miles off the Gate.

00:11:09.173 --> 00:11:11.926
And most people think of this
as kind of a bird sanctuary,

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:14.617
but we took our robot, and we sent it in.

00:11:15.125 --> 00:11:19.322
And the people on the boat were astonished
at the life beneath the surface.

00:11:20.101 --> 00:11:23.768
I mean, these are really,
really important ecosystems.

00:11:24.625 --> 00:11:28.855
Really, and this is a whole
wild world we haven't yet explored.

00:11:28.879 --> 00:11:31.871
And we have an opportunity right now,

00:11:31.895 --> 00:11:34.037
just as they did 100 years ago,

00:11:34.061 --> 00:11:38.886
to protect these places, to put in a plan,
to keep people engaged.

00:11:39.625 --> 00:11:41.950
So last year, when the executive
order came out,

00:11:41.974 --> 00:11:43.832
putting all of the progress we've made,

00:11:43.856 --> 00:11:47.138
all of these new marine protected
areas, under review,

00:11:47.162 --> 00:11:50.749
there were over 100,000 people
who commented online.

00:11:51.845 --> 00:11:54.448
Almost all of these letters were saying,

00:11:54.472 --> 00:11:58.805
"Don't do it; protecting these places
is the right thing to do."

00:11:59.839 --> 00:12:03.728
My message to those 100,000 people,
those 100,000 letters is:

00:12:03.752 --> 00:12:05.442
don't wait for Washington.

00:12:05.466 --> 00:12:07.093
We can do this ourselves.

00:12:07.117 --> 00:12:08.291
Thank you.

00:12:08.315 --> 00:12:12.497
(Applause)
