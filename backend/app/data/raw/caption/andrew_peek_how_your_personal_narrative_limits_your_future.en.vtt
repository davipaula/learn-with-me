00:00:14.884 --> 00:00:16.984
I mean we've all got a story
we like to tell,

00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:18.909
myself included, so here goes.

00:00:19.926 --> 00:00:22.276
As a kid, I sang in a pretty decent choir.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.429
We'd go around the world
performing for popes and presidents.

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:27.349
But upon turning teenager,

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.708
I decided I was going to trade that in 
for a chance of being cool.

00:00:30.708 --> 00:00:34.056
So, for me, this meant cigarettes,
skateboards, petty crime.

00:00:34.584 --> 00:00:36.404
I'm sure you can fill in the rest.

00:00:37.416 --> 00:00:39.886
I failed miserably
at this particular brand of cool

00:00:39.886 --> 00:00:43.436
and then proceeded to become target 1A
for bullies for quite some time.

00:00:43.436 --> 00:00:46.416
Until finally, I found a path to relevance

00:00:46.416 --> 00:00:49.986
by stumbling into a role with nearly 
universal high school importance:

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:51.785
selling drugs.

00:00:53.423 --> 00:00:56.713
As I crossed into adulthood,
that decision and those that came with it

00:00:56.713 --> 00:00:59.753
nearly cost me everything in my life,
everything I'd worked for.

00:01:00.318 --> 00:01:02.553
But, as it happened,
I was given a second chance

00:01:02.553 --> 00:01:05.373
by a woman I haven't seen in 14 years

00:01:05.373 --> 00:01:07.630
but who is out there 
in the audience today -

00:01:08.197 --> 00:01:11.303
Justice Mavin Wong, thank you.

00:01:13.047 --> 00:01:14.647
This is where my story begins.

00:01:14.647 --> 00:01:17.319
I'm sure, no doubt, 
you tell yours just as well.

00:01:17.807 --> 00:01:21.007
We are unbelievably skilled 
at telling our own story -

00:01:21.445 --> 00:01:23.405
the progression, the adversity,

00:01:23.405 --> 00:01:27.165
always managing to convey this sense
of triumph in the present moment.

00:01:27.165 --> 00:01:28.795
And often, there's a hopefulness,

00:01:28.795 --> 00:01:32.025
sometimes even a confidence
in what the future has in store for us.

00:01:32.339 --> 00:01:34.102
We're like these master storytellers,

00:01:34.102 --> 00:01:36.759
and we... we're our favourite story.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.521
But our stories are going to kill us.

00:01:41.982 --> 00:01:44.072
Already, I can tell you they limit us,

00:01:44.072 --> 00:01:46.202
they hold us down and constrain us.

00:01:46.658 --> 00:01:48.618
Sometimes they even suffocate us.

00:01:49.888 --> 00:01:52.484
To their credit, though, 
at least they're consistent.

00:01:52.484 --> 00:01:54.543
They all follow the same 
narrative pattern,

00:01:54.543 --> 00:01:56.928
what we've come
to call the hero's journey.

00:01:56.928 --> 00:02:00.170
It's just that the hero's journey
we see played out on the big screen

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.907
teaches us that change happens 
inside the hero,

00:02:02.907 --> 00:02:05.372
while the world around them 
stays constant.

00:02:05.372 --> 00:02:08.244
Everyone effectively waits
for the hero to be reborn.

00:02:08.783 --> 00:02:12.292
And every time I see this,
I can't help but think to myself,

00:02:12.292 --> 00:02:15.815
how beautiful would it be
if the world worked that way,

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.689
if it waited for us 
to come around on our own time

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:20.769
to fully embrace our new selves,

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.484
and then step back into the picture

00:02:22.484 --> 00:02:25.019
with both feet 
firmly planted on the ground.

00:02:25.605 --> 00:02:27.302
Wouldn't that be nice?

00:02:27.302 --> 00:02:29.043
It's not at all how it happens.

00:02:29.837 --> 00:02:33.437
Instead, while we're out legalising
same-sex marriage in one moment,

00:02:33.437 --> 00:02:37.437
the very idea of a binary gender system
or a two-spouse limit

00:02:37.437 --> 00:02:39.430
is being challenged in the next.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.726
I can assure you, what we call
gay marriage today

00:02:41.726 --> 00:02:45.198
is going to seem like a traditional idea
to us a couple of years from now.

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:46.988
That's the world we live in.

00:02:46.988 --> 00:02:49.688
We don't get to experience change
as this beautiful arc

00:02:49.688 --> 00:02:51.947
that moves at a pace
we're comfortable with.

00:02:52.673 --> 00:02:55.323
Change comes quickly and without pause.

00:02:56.652 --> 00:02:59.080
And yet, studies show that
our willingness to change

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.540
goes down as we age.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.260
It's built right into our expectations
of people at different stages of life.

00:03:04.803 --> 00:03:07.953
We expect our friends to understand
concepts like white privilege

00:03:08.334 --> 00:03:11.594
but are satisfied if our parents
can simply avoid stereotypes.

00:03:12.164 --> 00:03:14.840
And our grandparents, I mean,
we hope for the best.

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:17.292
(Laughter)

00:03:17.292 --> 00:03:20.726
But sometimes we resign ourselves
to the fact 'old dogs, new tricks'.

00:03:21.892 --> 00:03:25.686
It's just that that's a card we're not
going to get to play for much longer.

00:03:26.504 --> 00:03:29.783
You see, unlike my dear grandmother,
who's managed to get through life

00:03:29.783 --> 00:03:33.153
without ever pumping her own gas
or using a cell phone,

00:03:33.153 --> 00:03:34.953
my soon-to-be 14-year-old goddaughter

00:03:34.953 --> 00:03:37.883
will grow up with an incredible amount
of technological change

00:03:37.883 --> 00:03:39.687
happening everywhere around her.

00:03:40.632 --> 00:03:43.794
And unlike our willingness to change,
which decreases linearly,

00:03:44.312 --> 00:03:46.738
technology's rate of change
is exponential.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.061
In fact, The Law of Accelerating Returns,

00:03:50.061 --> 00:03:52.668
that which governs
technology's rate of change,

00:03:52.668 --> 00:03:55.379
is quick to point out
that the amount of progress we saw

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:58.858
in the whole of the 20th century
was effectively repeated

00:03:58.858 --> 00:04:01.615
during the first 14 years
of Jessica's life.

00:04:02.317 --> 00:04:06.317
And what just took us 14 years
will take us only seven more from today.

00:04:07.512 --> 00:04:10.324
By 2040, when Jessica is 38 years old

00:04:10.324 --> 00:04:12.564
and beginning to consider
children of her own,

00:04:12.564 --> 00:04:16.594
a 20th century-worth of progress
will be happening multiple times a year.

00:04:17.368 --> 00:04:18.674
Think about that.

00:04:19.341 --> 00:04:21.997
What wisdom can we possibly impart
to a young person

00:04:21.997 --> 00:04:24.445
about living in a world
we can't even fathom?

00:04:25.585 --> 00:04:27.583
That's the nature
of an exponential curve -

00:04:27.583 --> 00:04:30.117
it takes a long time to reveal itself,

00:04:30.117 --> 00:04:32.543
but when it does,
almost nothing stays the same.

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:37.402
And though we prefer to talk about drones
and self-driving cars,

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:41.109
historians tell us that it's actually
technology's ability

00:04:41.109 --> 00:04:44.127
to deliver us new ideas,
which in turn change our behaviour,

00:04:44.127 --> 00:04:47.704
which we most often underestimate
and fail to predict.

00:04:48.548 --> 00:04:51.423
We're not only slow to predict them,
we're slow to adapt

00:04:52.126 --> 00:04:53.969
because our stories weigh a ton.

00:04:54.777 --> 00:04:56.167
Let me give you an example.

00:04:57.117 --> 00:04:58.740
How many of us recall being nudged

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.694
towards a good career
when we were young -

00:05:00.694 --> 00:05:03.593
safe bets, like law
or medicine or accounting?

00:05:04.146 --> 00:05:06.624
These were the careers 
to aspire to, we were told.

00:05:07.716 --> 00:05:10.047
They're also amongst the top
of the chopping block

00:05:10.047 --> 00:05:11.827
when it comes to automation.

00:05:12.115 --> 00:05:14.495
Turns out machines don't need
eight years of school

00:05:14.495 --> 00:05:16.295
to memorise facts and patterns.

00:05:16.854 --> 00:05:19.713
But will we seriously start teaching
today's middle schoolers

00:05:19.713 --> 00:05:22.183
that they may want to avoid
these at-risk jobs?

00:05:22.926 --> 00:05:24.876
Or are we wrapped
in the warmth of a story

00:05:24.876 --> 00:05:26.765
that we've been writing for decades -

00:05:27.433 --> 00:05:29.501
that degrees always mean better jobs?

00:05:29.501 --> 00:05:32.641
Better jobs lead to better pay,
better pay to better possessions,

00:05:32.641 --> 00:05:34.981
and better possessions
afford us greater security.

00:05:34.981 --> 00:05:36.881
But how much security can there be

00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:40.894
if we're already spending two-thirds
of our income on a single-family home

00:05:40.894 --> 00:05:43.351
because that's our version
of a storybook ending?

00:05:43.351 --> 00:05:45.986
The truth is that the further
we are into a story,

00:05:46.526 --> 00:05:49.099
the less likely we are
to want to rewrite it.

00:05:49.684 --> 00:05:51.426
So we stick to the script.

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:55.926
Now, at this point,
I think I need to go on the record

00:05:55.926 --> 00:05:58.165
and tell you guys that I love stories.

00:05:58.165 --> 00:06:01.770
Really, I do. I've got a company
in the business of telling stories even.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.776
But as we start to peer over the horizon,
I think it's hard not to notice

00:06:05.776 --> 00:06:08.000
that what's needed here
is something lighter,

00:06:08.768 --> 00:06:09.957
something easier to move,

00:06:09.957 --> 00:06:12.649
something malleable
that can keep up with the pace.

00:06:14.283 --> 00:06:15.795
Like an idea.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.601
What would that look like,
do you think? The 'idea of me'.

00:06:21.894 --> 00:06:25.232
Now granted, as far as
psychological constructs go,

00:06:25.232 --> 00:06:27.829
at first, the two seem strikingly similar.

00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:30.662
The story of me, the idea of me.
Almost like semantics even.

00:06:30.662 --> 00:06:32.520
I want to make sure you're with me here

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.784
before I go any further
down this rabbit hole.

00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:38.598
When I talk about a story,
I'm talking about something we write once.

00:06:39.367 --> 00:06:42.385
But 'the idea of me' is something
we rewrite every day.

00:06:43.548 --> 00:06:47.286
It's untying ourselves
from these goals we have way out there

00:06:47.903 --> 00:06:51.713
that assume the world out there
looks much the same as it does here today.

00:06:52.638 --> 00:06:54.991
So letting go of what
should be for what is.

00:06:56.907 --> 00:06:58.347
So with that all squared away,

00:06:58.347 --> 00:07:01.887
I'd like to tell you the most recent time
I had to rewrite my own story.

00:07:03.244 --> 00:07:05.804
It would have been
just over two years ago now.

00:07:05.804 --> 00:07:08.356
After about a decade
in the industry, at least for me,

00:07:08.356 --> 00:07:10.226
my partners and I achieved something

00:07:10.226 --> 00:07:12.916
most entrepreneurs consider
to be a benchmark of success,

00:07:12.916 --> 00:07:14.457
especially in tech:

00:07:14.457 --> 00:07:16.117
we sold our company.

00:07:16.567 --> 00:07:19.674
We didn't just sell it to anyone,
but to the next great chapter

00:07:19.674 --> 00:07:22.048
in Canadian technology history,

00:07:22.048 --> 00:07:24.696
a company whose IPO
you might have followed this year.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.500
I got to tell you, 
it's a pretty great story.

00:07:27.831 --> 00:07:30.231
I don't think I could
have written a better script.

00:07:31.385 --> 00:07:35.808
Sure enough, so the story goes,
roughly six months later, I was let go.

00:07:36.664 --> 00:07:38.634
Who am I kidding?
We're all friends here.

00:07:38.634 --> 00:07:40.574
Six months later, I was fired.

00:07:40.574 --> 00:07:41.914
(Laughter)

00:07:41.914 --> 00:07:44.634
After a decade of writing my story
as a tech entrepreneur,

00:07:44.634 --> 00:07:48.412
I was fired by the top act
in town. It's a long fall.

00:07:48.961 --> 00:07:51.591
While it wasn't immediately obvious
to me in the moment,

00:07:51.591 --> 00:07:55.799
there was something beautiful about having
the rug pulled out from under me that day.

00:07:55.799 --> 00:08:00.737
Like a lightness that came from realising
I didn't actually vanish

00:08:00.737 --> 00:08:02.910
by virtue of losing my story.

00:08:03.954 --> 00:08:08.114
That there, in the empty space,
was an idea of who I might be next.

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:12.731
At the same time,
it was deeply unsettling.

00:08:14.088 --> 00:08:18.371
I found the switch from story to idea
really challenged my sovereignty.

00:08:18.371 --> 00:08:22.097
You see, my story had one author
with veto power and final say

00:08:22.097 --> 00:08:24.948
on the interpretation
of all the events in my life.

00:08:25.286 --> 00:08:27.336
When it's a story,
that's kind of how it is.

00:08:27.336 --> 00:08:29.536
We get to choose
how we perceive those events,

00:08:29.536 --> 00:08:31.516
and we do so in a way that best suits us,

00:08:31.516 --> 00:08:34.478
that leaves the story as much
intact as possible.

00:08:34.872 --> 00:08:37.243
Got bullied as a kid? You pick the reason.

00:08:37.523 --> 00:08:40.799
Got let go? Ultimately, you're going
to decide why that was.

00:08:41.537 --> 00:08:44.090
Stories force us
into these either/or choices,

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:47.743
where either it fits the script
we have for ourselves or it doesn't.

00:08:48.708 --> 00:08:50.334
But 'the idea of me',

00:08:51.569 --> 00:08:55.874
I quickly realised 'the idea of me'
isn't built on an either/or at all.

00:08:57.069 --> 00:08:58.771
It's built on 'and'.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.280
Instead of getting caught up
with whether we're a success or a failure,

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.390
whether we're right or we're wrong,

00:09:05.909 --> 00:09:07.779
'and' reminds us that both are true.

00:09:09.525 --> 00:09:13.109
In fact, all things new are born this way
by standing at the intersection

00:09:13.672 --> 00:09:16.940
and holding the tension
between two choices that already exist

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.120
so that a third can emerge.

00:09:20.673 --> 00:09:23.143
And it isn't just true
for 'the idea of me',

00:09:23.143 --> 00:09:24.633
this is true for all ideas.

00:09:24.633 --> 00:09:26.113
When you start to tune into it,

00:09:26.113 --> 00:09:28.833
you can start to see ideas
being added to everywhere.

00:09:29.993 --> 00:09:33.286
Gender, privacy, mental health, democracy:

00:09:33.286 --> 00:09:35.288
take any one of these
as ideas for a moment

00:09:35.288 --> 00:09:38.548
and ask yourself whether you remember
a time when they were simpler.

00:09:38.548 --> 00:09:39.878
I know I do.

00:09:40.251 --> 00:09:42.841
When I was growing up,
gender used to mean boy or girl.

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.427
If you go back just a couple of years,

00:09:45.427 --> 00:09:48.617
mental health used to only imply
there was something wrong with you.

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:51.186
But then these ideas got bigger.

00:09:51.739 --> 00:09:52.979
We kept adding to them.

00:09:52.979 --> 00:09:54.359
They expanded.

00:09:55.652 --> 00:09:58.833
Maybe the most prescient example
from the past year is racism.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:01.841
This is an idea
going through an expansion.

00:10:02.637 --> 00:10:05.397
You see, racism started out
as a struggle for equal rights,

00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:08.844
but the achievement of equal rights
didn't dispel the idea of racism,

00:10:08.844 --> 00:10:10.488
it just expanded the conversation

00:10:10.488 --> 00:10:13.543
to include all of racism's
less obvious expressions.

00:10:14.724 --> 00:10:16.300
Today, when we talk about racism,

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.533
we talk about an idea
that's many layers deep.

00:10:19.218 --> 00:10:21.668
We talk about that
which we can't always point to

00:10:22.124 --> 00:10:25.134
or that's not necessarily propagated
by any one group or person.

00:10:25.134 --> 00:10:26.345
But it's there.

00:10:27.037 --> 00:10:28.270
It's there in privilege.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.790
It's there in access. 
It's there in protection.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:34.027
We talk about racism as being systemic,
a system we're all a part of

00:10:34.027 --> 00:10:36.290
but only a fraction of us benefit from.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.750
This is how an idea gets bigger with time.

00:10:40.207 --> 00:10:43.894
And if, in turn, you choose
to see yourself as an idea,

00:10:43.894 --> 00:10:47.937
then hearing you might be the beneficiary
of a still racist system is not a threat -

00:10:48.592 --> 00:10:50.984
it's a chance to expand your own idea,

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:53.161
to add in that new perspective.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:11:00.006
But if we're a story, we're going
to find ourselves at an either/or impasse,

00:11:00.006 --> 00:11:03.433
where either we protect the part
of the script that says we're not racist

00:11:03.433 --> 00:11:05.424
or we'll have a lot of rewriting to do.

00:11:06.248 --> 00:11:09.351
Stories are how we've come
to construct our identity.

00:11:10.475 --> 00:11:13.067
And we're terrified
to lose track of who we are.

00:11:13.744 --> 00:11:17.505
But I've got to tell you, I think this is
where we're getting it terribly wrong.

00:11:18.165 --> 00:11:22.075
When you build your identity on a story,
it becomes a once and for all discovery.

00:11:22.075 --> 00:11:24.755
We even talk about people before and after

00:11:24.755 --> 00:11:27.705
this elusive moment
where they 'found themselves'.

00:11:29.171 --> 00:11:33.245
But if you believe yourself to be an idea,
then identity becomes a moving target,

00:11:34.415 --> 00:11:36.155
a never-ending discovery.

00:11:36.973 --> 00:11:39.533
Not just because the idea of you
is always expanding,

00:11:39.533 --> 00:11:42.243
but so too are the ideas all around you.

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:44.243
Every moment becomes this wonderful chance

00:11:44.243 --> 00:11:47.990
to recalibrate, to revisit
your relationship to another idea.

00:11:48.352 --> 00:11:51.494
It's an acknowledgement that
'I'm not racist' is a temporary state,

00:11:51.494 --> 00:11:53.776
just like 'I'm a capitalist'
or 'I'm a feminist',

00:11:53.776 --> 00:11:55.140
or frankly, 'I'm straight.'

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.623
This is the practice, this is growth,
this is what growth is.

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:01.565
And so rather than fearing
the fast-paced future

00:12:01.565 --> 00:12:02.804
hiding in plain view,

00:12:02.804 --> 00:12:05.825
why not choose to see it as the force
bringing us into alignment

00:12:05.825 --> 00:12:07.535
with the rest of life?

00:12:08.781 --> 00:12:11.839
Everywhere we look,
our systems are wired for growth.

00:12:12.178 --> 00:12:15.248
From our words and concepts
to the neuroplasticity of our brain.

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:18.370
From the evolution of our species
to the universe at large.

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:21.367
When it's change out there,
we feel excitement,

00:12:21.367 --> 00:12:23.859
we feel a hopefulness
about a tomorrow that is bigger

00:12:23.859 --> 00:12:25.768
and more full and more inclusive.

00:12:25.768 --> 00:12:29.768
We chase after it with our art
and our science and our debates.

00:12:29.768 --> 00:12:34.066
When it's out there, we demand change,
we see the possibility for it everywhere -

00:12:34.066 --> 00:12:37.517
everywhere except in the way
we talk about ourselves.

00:12:38.312 --> 00:12:43.499
Only there do we write the story once
and expect the future to obey.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.540
The good news for us
is that it never does.

00:12:49.687 --> 00:12:51.575
Whether an arrest or getting fired,

00:12:52.305 --> 00:12:54.322
divorce, disease,
the death of a loved one,

00:12:54.322 --> 00:12:56.113
maybe a failure of some kind,

00:12:56.113 --> 00:12:58.424
we've all seen our stories interrupted.

00:12:58.424 --> 00:13:01.468
We don't write these tragic bits
into the original script,

00:13:02.077 --> 00:13:07.582
they're wrenches that are thrown our way
that force us to rewrite again and again.

00:13:08.892 --> 00:13:11.442
And I think that's what
'the idea of me' needs to be -

00:13:11.442 --> 00:13:13.985
a commitment to that rewriting every day.

00:13:15.397 --> 00:13:18.860
Not because we have to, 
because we want to.

00:13:19.581 --> 00:13:23.384
Because we love to create,
and it is infinitely easier to do so

00:13:23.384 --> 00:13:25.695
without a story dragging along behind.

00:13:27.418 --> 00:13:30.772
You know, Bob Dylan knew this
when he famously said, tongue in cheek,

00:13:31.697 --> 00:13:35.010
'Do not create anything'
because 'it will not change' -

00:13:35.797 --> 00:13:38.663
implying, of course, that the world
might love what you make,

00:13:39.105 --> 00:13:41.572
but you'll be different
by the time they do.

00:13:42.797 --> 00:13:45.648
As an artist, he refused to get married
to his own mythology,

00:13:45.648 --> 00:13:48.674
the story of Dylan, the folk singer
or the voice of protest.

00:13:49.868 --> 00:13:51.082
Steve Jobs knew this

00:13:51.082 --> 00:13:53.705
when he continuously cannibalised
Apple's product lines.

00:13:53.705 --> 00:13:55.515
He knew falling in love with the story

00:13:55.515 --> 00:13:59.179
that Apple was the best at computers,
the best at phones, the best at tablets,

00:13:59.179 --> 00:14:00.366
was a death sentence,

00:14:00.366 --> 00:14:03.524
in that it meant the end
was just around the corner.

00:14:04.535 --> 00:14:06.972
He knew creating was an act of letting go.

00:14:08.339 --> 00:14:10.920
And now, after quite a few rewrites,

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.739
and though sometimes
kicking and screaming,

00:14:13.739 --> 00:14:15.808
I'm beginning to see this for myself.

00:14:16.821 --> 00:14:19.111
And I think it's something
we should all embrace.

00:14:19.924 --> 00:14:22.997
Because creating isn't reserved
for artists and entrepreneurs,

00:14:23.483 --> 00:14:26.020
it's the natural state in all of us.

00:14:27.574 --> 00:14:31.594
All technology ever does is put that power
to create squarely in our hands

00:14:31.594 --> 00:14:33.844
because it knows something about us

00:14:33.844 --> 00:14:36.735
that we're still
not quite ready to admit -

00:14:38.448 --> 00:14:43.430
that more than being our favourite story,
we'd rather be our greatest creation,

00:14:44.812 --> 00:14:46.420
an idea waiting to happen.

00:14:47.469 --> 00:14:48.929
Thank you.

00:14:48.929 --> 00:14:51.739
(Applause)
