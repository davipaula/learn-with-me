00:00:13.375 --> 00:00:15.208
I'm a protein designer.

00:00:16.917 --> 00:00:19.851
And I'd like to discuss
a new type of medicine.

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:23.976
It's made from a molecule
called a constrained peptide.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.976
There are only a few constrained
peptide drugs available today,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.143
but there are a lot that will hit
the market in the coming decade.

00:00:30.167 --> 00:00:32.601
Let's explore what these new
medicines are made of,

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:35.768
how they're different and what's causing
this incoming tidal wave

00:00:35.792 --> 00:00:37.375
of new and exciting medicines.

00:00:38.167 --> 00:00:42.184
Constrained peptides
are very small proteins.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:45.685
They've got extra chemical bonds
that constrain the shape of the molecule,

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:47.684
and this makes them incredibly stable

00:00:47.708 --> 00:00:49.375
as well as highly potent.

00:00:50.125 --> 00:00:53.518
They're naturally occurring,
our bodies actually produce a few of these

00:00:53.542 --> 00:00:56.447
that help us to combat
bacterial, fungal and viral infections.

00:00:56.471 --> 00:00:58.351
And animals like snakes and scorpions

00:00:58.375 --> 00:01:00.601
use constrained peptides in their venom.

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:03.809
Drugs that are made of protein
are called biologic drugs.

00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:05.726
So this includes constrained peptides,

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.184
as well as medicines like insulin

00:01:08.208 --> 00:01:11.809
or antibody drugs like Humira or Enbrel.

00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:14.934
And in general, biologics are great,

00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:19.143
because they avoid several ways
that drugs can cause side effects.

00:01:19.167 --> 00:01:20.601
First, protein.

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:23.726
It's a totally natural,
nontoxic material in our bodies.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.518
Our cells produce tens of thousands
of different proteins,

00:01:26.542 --> 00:01:29.226
and basically, all of our food
has protein in it.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.143
And second, sometimes drugs interact
with molecules in your body

00:01:33.167 --> 00:01:34.601
that you don't want them to.

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:36.518
Compared to small molecule drugs,

00:01:36.542 --> 00:01:39.309
and by this I mean
regular drugs, like aspirin,

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:41.268
biologics are quite large.

00:01:41.292 --> 00:01:45.184
Molecules interact when they adopt shapes
that fit together perfectly.

00:01:45.208 --> 00:01:46.726
Much like a lock and key.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.768
Well, a larger key has more grooves,

00:01:48.792 --> 00:01:52.143
so it's more likely to fit
into a single lock.

00:01:52.167 --> 00:01:54.893
But most biologics also have a flaw.

00:01:54.917 --> 00:01:56.184
They're fragile.

00:01:56.208 --> 00:01:58.351
So they're usually
administered by injection,

00:01:58.375 --> 00:02:00.809
because our stomach acid
would destroy the medicine

00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:02.101
if we tried to swallow it.

00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:04.018
Constrained peptides are the opposite.

00:02:04.042 --> 00:02:06.184
They're really durable,
like regular drugs.

00:02:06.208 --> 00:02:10.750
So it's possible to administer them
using pills, inhalers, ointments.

00:02:11.792 --> 00:02:16.059
This is what makes constrained peptides
so desirable for drug development.

00:02:16.083 --> 00:02:17.893
They combine some of the best features

00:02:17.917 --> 00:02:21.684
of small-molecule
and biologic drugs into one.

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:24.268
But unfortunately,
it's incredibly difficult

00:02:24.292 --> 00:02:27.184
to reengineer the constrained peptides
that we find in nature

00:02:27.208 --> 00:02:28.893
to become new drugs.

00:02:28.917 --> 00:02:30.226
So this is where I come in.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.601
Creating a new drug
is a lot like crafting a key

00:02:33.625 --> 00:02:36.101
to fit a particular lock.

00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:37.851
We need to get the shape just right.

00:02:37.875 --> 00:02:40.893
But if we change the shape
of a constrained peptide by too much,

00:02:40.917 --> 00:02:43.059
those extra chemical bonds
are unable to form

00:02:43.083 --> 00:02:45.059
and the whole molecule falls apart.

00:02:45.083 --> 00:02:48.518
So we needed to figure out
how to gain control over their shape.

00:02:48.542 --> 00:02:50.768
I was part of a collaborative
scientific effort

00:02:50.792 --> 00:02:53.976
that spanned a dozen institutions
across three continents

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.393
that came together
and solved this problem.

00:02:57.417 --> 00:03:00.518
We took a radically different approach
from previous efforts.

00:03:00.542 --> 00:03:03.059
Instead of making changes
to the constrained peptides

00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:04.351
that we find in nature,

00:03:04.375 --> 00:03:07.643
we figured out how to build new ones
totally from scratch.

00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:08.934
To help us do this,

00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:12.006
we developed freely available
open-source peptide-design software

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.809
that anyone can use to do this, too.

00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:15.268
To test our method out,

00:03:15.292 --> 00:03:18.226
we generated a series
of constrained peptides

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.476
that have a wide variety
of different shapes.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.934
Many of these had never been seen
in nature before.

00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.851
Then we went into the laboratory
and produced these peptides.

00:03:25.875 --> 00:03:28.393
Next, we determined
their molecular structures,

00:03:28.417 --> 00:03:29.809
using experiments.

00:03:29.833 --> 00:03:31.726
When we compared our designed models

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.476
with the real molecular structures,

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.601
we found that our software
can position individual atoms

00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:39.851
with an accuracy that's at the limit
of what's possible to measure.

00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:42.059
Three years ago, this couldn't be done.

00:03:42.083 --> 00:03:45.101
But today, we have the ability
to create designer peptides

00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:48.518
with shapes that are custom-tailored
for drug development.

00:03:48.542 --> 00:03:50.500
So where is this technology taking us?

00:03:51.292 --> 00:03:52.559
Well, recently,

00:03:52.583 --> 00:03:54.869
my colleagues and I
designed constrained peptides

00:03:54.893 --> 00:03:58.309
that neutralize influenza virus,

00:03:58.333 --> 00:04:01.268
protect against botulism poisoning

00:04:01.292 --> 00:04:03.393
and block cancer cells from growing.

00:04:03.417 --> 00:04:04.726
Some of these new drugs

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.726
have been tested in preclinical trials
with laboratory animals.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.976
And so far, they're all safe
and highly effective.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.143
Constrained peptide design
is a cutting-edge technology,

00:04:15.167 --> 00:04:17.768
and the drug development pipeline
is slow and cautious.

00:04:17.792 --> 00:04:20.476
So we're still three to five years
out from human trials.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.768
But during that time,

00:04:21.792 --> 00:04:23.226
more constrained peptide drugs

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.851
are going to be entering
the drug development pipeline.

00:04:25.875 --> 00:04:30.018
And ultimately, I believe
that designed peptide drugs

00:04:30.042 --> 00:04:32.059
are going to enable us all to break free

00:04:32.083 --> 00:04:34.601
from the constraints of our diseases.

00:04:34.625 --> 00:04:35.893
Thank you.

00:04:35.917 --> 00:04:40.042
(Applause)
