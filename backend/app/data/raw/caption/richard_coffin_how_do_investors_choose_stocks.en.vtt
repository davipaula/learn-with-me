00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.733
Every day, billions of stocks are traded 
on the New York Stock Exchange alone.

00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:17.519
But with over 43,000 companies listed 
on stock exchanges around the world,

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:21.279
how do investors decide 
which stocks to buy?

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.135
To answer this question, it’s important 
to first understand what stocks are,

00:00:26.135 --> 00:00:31.749
and what individuals and institutions 
hope to achieve by investing in them.

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:35.519
Stocks are partial shares 
of ownership in a company.

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:39.930
So by buying a stock, investors buy 
a share in the company’s success—

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.684
or failure—
as measured by the company’s profits.

00:00:43.684 --> 00:00:46.190
A stock’s price is determined 
by the number

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.720
of buyers and sellers trading it;

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.873
if there are more buyers than sellers, 
the price will increase, and vice versa.

00:00:53.873 --> 00:00:56.743
The market price of a share 
therefore represents

00:00:56.743 --> 00:01:01.935
what buyers and sellers believe the stock,
and by association the company,

00:01:01.935 --> 00:01:03.145
is worth.

00:01:03.145 --> 00:01:05.085
So the price can change dramatically

00:01:05.085 --> 00:01:08.625
based on whether investors think 
the company has a high potential

00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:13.841
for increasing profitability— 
even if it isn’t profitable yet.

00:01:13.841 --> 00:01:16.721
Investors aim to make money 
by purchasing stocks

00:01:16.721 --> 00:01:19.555
whose value will increase over time.

00:01:19.555 --> 00:01:22.995
Some investors aim simply to grow 
their money at a faster rate

00:01:22.995 --> 00:01:25.915
than inflation diminishes its value.

00:01:25.915 --> 00:01:28.555
Others have a goal 
of “beating the market,”

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:31.055
which means growing their money 
at a faster rate

00:01:31.055 --> 00:01:35.065
than the cumulative performance 
of all companies’ stocks.

00:01:35.065 --> 00:01:39.385
This idea of “beating the market” 
is a source of debate among investors—

00:01:39.385 --> 00:01:43.308
in fact, investors break 
into two main groups over it.

00:01:43.308 --> 00:01:46.755
Active investors believe it is possible 
to beat the market

00:01:46.755 --> 00:01:51.853
by strategically selecting specific stocks
and timing their trades,

00:01:51.853 --> 00:01:56.809
while passive investors believe it isn’t 
usually possible to beat the market,

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:59.839
and don’t subscribe to stock picking.

00:01:59.839 --> 00:02:03.385
The phrase “beating the market” 
usually refers to earning a return

00:02:03.385 --> 00:02:08.090
on an investment that exceeds 
the Standard &amp; Poor 500 index.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.330
The S&amp;P 500 is a measure 
of the average performance

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.839
of 500 of the largest companies 
in the United States,

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:18.075
weighted by company valuation,

00:02:18.075 --> 00:02:20.485
meaning that companies 
with a higher market value

00:02:20.485 --> 00:02:23.095
have a larger effect on the S&amp;P—

00:02:23.095 --> 00:02:26.405
again, market value corresponds 
to what investors

00:02:26.405 --> 00:02:30.385
believe a company is worth 
rather than actual profits.

00:02:30.385 --> 00:02:34.084
The S&amp;P doesn’t directly represent 
the market as a whole—

00:02:34.084 --> 00:02:38.805
many small and mid-range stocks can 
fluctuate according to different patterns.

00:02:38.805 --> 00:02:42.345
Still, it’s a pretty good proxy 
for the overall market.

00:02:42.345 --> 00:02:43.501
It’s often said that

00:02:43.501 --> 00:02:46.995
“the stock market behaves 
like a voting machine in the short term,

00:02:46.995 --> 00:02:49.645
and a weighing machine in the long term”—

00:02:49.645 --> 00:02:54.228
meaning short term fluctuations 
in stock prices reflect public opinion,

00:02:54.228 --> 00:02:59.089
but over the longer term, they do tend 
to actually reflect companies’ profits.

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:04.635
Active investors aim to exploit 
the short term,

00:03:04.635 --> 00:03:07.145
“voting machine” aspect of the market.

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:09.847
They believe the market 
contains inefficiencies:

00:03:09.847 --> 00:03:14.793
that stock prices at any given point 
in time may overvalue some companies,

00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:20.720
undervalue others, or fail to reflect 
developments that will impact the market.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.950
Active investors hope to exploit 
these inefficiencies by buying stocks

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.961
they think are priced low.

00:03:26.961 --> 00:03:29.483
To identify undervalued stocks,

00:03:29.483 --> 00:03:32.863
they may investigate a company’s 
business operations,

00:03:32.863 --> 00:03:38.748
analyze its financial statements, 
observe price trends, or use algorithms.

00:03:38.748 --> 00:03:41.128
Passive investors, by contrast,

00:03:41.128 --> 00:03:45.293
put their faith in the long term 
“weighing machine” aspect of the market.

00:03:45.293 --> 00:03:49.911
They believe that even though markets may 
exhibit inefficiencies at any given point,

00:03:49.911 --> 00:03:52.931
over time those inefficiencies 
balance out—

00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:57.632
so if they buy a selection of stocks that 
represents a cross-section of the market,

00:03:57.632 --> 00:04:00.272
over time it will grow.

00:04:00.272 --> 00:04:03.113
This is usually accomplished 
through index funds,

00:04:03.113 --> 00:04:06.473
collections of stocks that represent 
the broader market.

00:04:06.473 --> 00:04:10.465
The S&amp;P 500 index is one of many indexes.

00:04:10.465 --> 00:04:14.085
The overall goal is the same 
for all index funds:

00:04:14.085 --> 00:04:19.429
to hold stocks for the long term
and ignore short-term market fluctuations.

00:04:19.429 --> 00:04:24.216
Ultimately, active and passive investing 
aren’t mutually exclusive—

00:04:24.216 --> 00:04:27.016
many investment strategies 
have elements of each,

00:04:27.016 --> 00:04:31.275
for example, choosing stocks actively 
but holding them for the long term

00:04:31.275 --> 00:04:34.345
as passive investing advises.

00:04:34.345 --> 00:04:36.625
Investing is far from an exact science:

00:04:36.625 --> 00:04:40.205
if there was one foolproof method, 
everyone would be doing it.
