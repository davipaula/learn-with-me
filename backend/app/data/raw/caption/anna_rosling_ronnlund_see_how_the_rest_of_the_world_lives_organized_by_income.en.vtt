00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.222
What images do we see
from the rest of the world?

00:00:16.714 --> 00:00:19.114
We see natural disasters,

00:00:19.138 --> 00:00:21.012
war, terror.

00:00:21.036 --> 00:00:22.370
We see refugees,

00:00:22.833 --> 00:00:24.301
and we see horrible diseases.

00:00:24.325 --> 00:00:25.476
Right?

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.143
We see beautiful beaches,

00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:28.450
cute animals,

00:00:28.474 --> 00:00:29.816
beautiful nature,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.794
cultural rites and stuff.

00:00:32.557 --> 00:00:35.880
And then we're supposed to make
the connection in our head

00:00:35.904 --> 00:00:37.657
and create a worldview out of this.

00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:39.458
And how is that possible?

00:00:39.482 --> 00:00:42.493
I mean, the world seems so strange.

00:00:42.517 --> 00:00:44.113
And I don't think it is.

00:00:44.137 --> 00:00:46.817
I don't think the world
is that strange, actually.

00:00:47.236 --> 00:00:48.724
I've got an idea.

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:51.391
So, imagine the world as a street,

00:00:52.146 --> 00:00:55.952
where the poorest live on one end
and the richest on the other,

00:00:55.976 --> 00:00:58.717
and everyone in the world
lives on this street.

00:00:58.741 --> 00:01:01.017
You live there, I live there,

00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:04.806
and the neighbors we have
are the ones with the same income.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.754
People that live in the same block as me,

00:01:07.778 --> 00:01:12.816
they are from other countries,
other cultures, other religions.

00:01:13.202 --> 00:01:15.591
The street might look something like this.

00:01:15.615 --> 00:01:17.193
And I was curious.

00:01:17.652 --> 00:01:19.582
In Sweden where I live,

00:01:19.606 --> 00:01:22.141
I've been meeting quite a lot of students.

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:23.535
And I wanted to know,

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:26.652
where would they think
they belong on a street like this?

00:01:26.676 --> 00:01:30.180
So we changed these houses into people.

00:01:30.204 --> 00:01:33.915
This is the seven billion people
that live in the world.

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.878
And just by living in Sweden,
most likely you belong there,

00:01:37.902 --> 00:01:39.359
which is the richest group.

00:01:39.788 --> 00:01:42.022
But the students, when you ask them,

00:01:42.046 --> 00:01:43.853
they think they are in the middle.

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:46.829
And how can you understand the world

00:01:46.853 --> 00:01:50.256
when you see all these scary
images from the world,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.637
and you think you live in the middle,
while you're actually atop?

00:01:54.183 --> 00:01:55.406
Not very easy.

00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:57.900
So I sent out photographers

00:01:57.924 --> 00:02:03.080
to 264 homes in 50 countries --
so far, still counting --

00:02:03.104 --> 00:02:07.531
and in each home, the photographers
take the same set of photos.

00:02:07.555 --> 00:02:09.191
They take the bed,

00:02:09.215 --> 00:02:10.412
the stove,

00:02:10.436 --> 00:02:11.679
the toys

00:02:11.703 --> 00:02:14.055
and about 135 other things.

00:02:14.577 --> 00:02:17.685
So we have 40,000 images
or something at the moment,

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.696
and it looks something like this.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.766
Here we see, it says on the top,

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.807
"Families in the world by income,"

00:02:24.831 --> 00:02:28.365
and we have the street represented
just beneath it, you can see.

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:31.025
And then we see some
of the families we have visited.

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.785
We have the poorer to the left,
the richer to the right,

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:36.619
and everybody else in between,
as the concept says.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.167
We can go down and see the different
families we have been to so far.

00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:43.578
Here, for instance, we have
a family in Zimbabwe,

00:02:43.602 --> 00:02:47.168
one in India, one in Russia,
and one in Mexico, for instance.

00:02:47.192 --> 00:02:49.795
So we can go around and look
at the families this way.

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.131
But of course, we can choose
if we want to see some certain countries

00:02:53.155 --> 00:02:54.317
and compare them,

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:56.623
or regions, or if we want,
to see other things.

00:02:56.647 --> 00:02:58.786
So let's go to the front doors

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.295
and see what they look like.

00:03:00.778 --> 00:03:05.469
Go here, and this is the world
by front doors, ordered by income.

00:03:06.231 --> 00:03:08.412
And we can see the big difference

00:03:08.436 --> 00:03:12.692
from India, Philippines, China,
Ukraine, in these examples, for instance.

00:03:13.323 --> 00:03:15.208
What if we go into the home?

00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:17.208
We can look at beds.

00:03:19.073 --> 00:03:20.863
This is what beds can look like.

00:03:21.318 --> 00:03:23.428
Doesn't look like the glossy magazines.

00:03:23.452 --> 00:03:26.242
Doesn't look like
the scary images in the media.

00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:28.889
So remember that the students in Sweden,

00:03:28.913 --> 00:03:31.623
they thought they were in the middle
of the world income.

00:03:31.647 --> 00:03:33.026
So let's go there.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.329
We zoom in here by filtering
the street to the middle,

00:03:38.736 --> 00:03:40.028
like this,

00:03:40.052 --> 00:03:41.767
and then I ask the students:

00:03:41.791 --> 00:03:43.964
Is this what your bedroom looks like?

00:03:43.988 --> 00:03:47.543
And they would actually
not feel very at home.

00:03:47.567 --> 00:03:51.255
So we go down and see,
do they feel more at home here?

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:52.430
And they would say,

00:03:52.454 --> 00:03:55.275
no, this is not what a Swedish
typical bedroom looks like.

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.747
We go up here,

00:03:57.748 --> 00:04:00.955
and suddenly, they feel sort of at home.

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:02.750
And we can see here in this image,

00:04:02.774 --> 00:04:05.545
we see bedrooms in China, Netherlands,

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.341
South Korea, France
and the United States, for instance.

00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:10.533
So we can click here.

00:04:10.557 --> 00:04:15.006
If we want to know more about the family,
the home in which this bed stands,

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.073
we can just click it and go to the family,

00:04:18.097 --> 00:04:21.016
and we can see all the images
from that family.

00:04:21.445 --> 00:04:23.096
We can go this way, too.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.392
And of course, this is free
for anyone to use.

00:04:25.416 --> 00:04:29.201
So just go here, and please
add more images, of course.

00:04:29.225 --> 00:04:32.934
My personal favorite that everyone
always tries to make me not show,

00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.133
I'm going to show you now,
and that's toilets,

00:04:35.157 --> 00:04:38.107
because you're not really allowed
to look at people's toilets,

00:04:38.131 --> 00:04:39.775
but now we can just do it, right?

00:04:39.799 --> 00:04:42.212
So here (Laughter)
we have a lot of toilets.

00:04:42.236 --> 00:04:44.583
They look pretty much
as we're used to, right?

00:04:44.607 --> 00:04:48.023
And they are in China, Netherlands,
United States, Nepal and so forth,

00:04:48.047 --> 00:04:49.538
Ukraine, France.

00:04:49.935 --> 00:04:51.740
And they look pretty similar, right?

00:04:51.764 --> 00:04:54.386
But remember, we are in the top.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.711
So what about checking all the toilets?

00:04:59.457 --> 00:05:01.939
Now it looks a bit different, doesn't it?

00:05:01.963 --> 00:05:07.854
So this way we can visually browse
through categories of imagery,

00:05:07.878 --> 00:05:09.523
using photos as data.

00:05:09.908 --> 00:05:13.137
But not everything works as a photo.

00:05:13.161 --> 00:05:16.397
Sometimes it's easier
to understand what people do,

00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:20.092
so we also do video snippets
of everyday activities,

00:05:20.116 --> 00:05:22.558
such as washing hands, doing laundry,

00:05:22.582 --> 00:05:24.224
brushing teeth, and so on.

00:05:24.248 --> 00:05:27.092
And I'm going to show you
a short snippet of tooth-brushing,

00:05:27.116 --> 00:05:29.024
and weâ€™re going to start at the top.

00:05:31.861 --> 00:05:34.409
So we see people brushing their teeth.

00:05:34.996 --> 00:05:37.215
Pretty interesting to see

00:05:37.239 --> 00:05:41.843
the same type of plastic toothbrush
is being used in all these places

00:05:41.867 --> 00:05:43.442
in the same way, right?

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.500
Some are more serious than others --

00:05:46.524 --> 00:05:47.530
(Laughter)

00:05:47.554 --> 00:05:49.257
but still, the toothbrush is there.

00:05:49.281 --> 00:05:51.934
And then, coming down to this poorer end,

00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.634
then we will see people
start using sticks,

00:05:55.768 --> 00:05:59.482
and they will sometimes use their finger
to brush their teeth.

00:06:00.016 --> 00:06:02.489
So this particular woman in Malawi,

00:06:02.513 --> 00:06:04.105
when she brushes her teeth,

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:06.232
she scrapes some mud off from her wall

00:06:06.256 --> 00:06:09.160
and she mixes it with water,
and then she's brushing.

00:06:09.184 --> 00:06:11.954
Therefore, in the Dollar Street material,

00:06:11.978 --> 00:06:14.088
we have tagged this image

00:06:14.112 --> 00:06:16.484
not only as her wall, which it is,

00:06:16.508 --> 00:06:18.935
but also as her toothpaste,

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:21.703
because that is also what she uses it for.

00:06:22.489 --> 00:06:25.172
So we can say, in the poorer
end of the street,

00:06:25.196 --> 00:06:27.648
you will use a stick or your finger,

00:06:27.672 --> 00:06:30.815
you come to the middle,
you will start using a toothbrush,

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:32.488
and then you come up to the top,

00:06:32.512 --> 00:06:34.327
and you will start using one each.

00:06:34.351 --> 00:06:37.254
Pretty nice, not sharing
a toothbrush with your grandma.

00:06:37.278 --> 00:06:40.124
And you can also look at some countries.

00:06:40.148 --> 00:06:43.005
Here, we have the income
distribution within the US,

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:44.723
most people in the middle.

00:06:44.747 --> 00:06:48.706
We have a family we visited
in the richer end, the Howards.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.477
We can see their home here.

00:06:50.501 --> 00:06:54.000
And we also visited a family
in the poorer end, down here.

00:06:54.024 --> 00:06:57.590
And then what we can do now
is we can do instant comparisons

00:06:57.614 --> 00:06:59.238
of things in their homes.

00:06:59.262 --> 00:07:01.766
Let's look in their cutlery drawer.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.868
So, observe the Hadleys:

00:07:03.892 --> 00:07:07.458
they have all their cutlery
in a green plastic box.

00:07:07.482 --> 00:07:11.411
and they have a few different types
and some of them are plastic,

00:07:11.435 --> 00:07:14.612
while the Howards,
they have this wooden drawer

00:07:14.636 --> 00:07:16.812
with small wooden compartments in it

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:19.565
and a section for each type of cutlery.

00:07:20.392 --> 00:07:22.265
We can add more families,

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:24.829
and we can see kitchen sinks,

00:07:24.853 --> 00:07:26.855
or maybe living rooms.

00:07:27.416 --> 00:07:29.821
Of course, we can do
the same in other countries.

00:07:29.845 --> 00:07:32.819
So we go to China, we pick three families.

00:07:33.434 --> 00:07:35.121
we look at their houses,

00:07:35.145 --> 00:07:36.981
we can look at their sofas,

00:07:37.005 --> 00:07:38.875
we can look at their stoves.

00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:40.759
And when you see these stoves,

00:07:40.783 --> 00:07:43.595
I think it's obvious
that it's a stupid thing

00:07:43.619 --> 00:07:46.811
that usually, when we think
about other countries,

00:07:46.835 --> 00:07:49.363
we think they have
a certain way of doing things.

00:07:49.387 --> 00:07:50.779
But look at these stoves.

00:07:50.803 --> 00:07:52.279
Very different, right,

00:07:52.303 --> 00:07:54.624
because it depends
on what income level you have,

00:07:54.648 --> 00:07:56.509
how you're going to cook your food.

00:07:56.533 --> 00:08:00.567
But the cool thing is when we start
comparing across countries.

00:08:00.591 --> 00:08:03.314
So here we have China and the US.

00:08:03.338 --> 00:08:06.543
See the big overlap between these two.

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:10.847
So we picked the two homes
we have already seen in these countries,

00:08:10.871 --> 00:08:12.603
the Wus and the Howards.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.760
Standing in their bedroom,

00:08:14.784 --> 00:08:18.768
pretty hard to tell which one is China
and which one is the US, right?

00:08:18.792 --> 00:08:21.083
Both have brown leather sofas,

00:08:21.107 --> 00:08:23.187
and they have similar play structures.

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:24.967
Most likely both are made in China,

00:08:24.991 --> 00:08:26.824
so, I mean, that's not very strange --

00:08:26.848 --> 00:08:27.959
(Laughter)

00:08:27.983 --> 00:08:29.296
but that is similar.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.079
We can of course go down
to the other end of the street,

00:08:32.103 --> 00:08:33.712
adding Nigeria.

00:08:33.736 --> 00:08:37.665
So let's compare two homes
in China and Nigeria.

00:08:37.689 --> 00:08:39.505
Looking at the family photos,

00:08:39.529 --> 00:08:42.664
they do not look like they have
a lot in common, do they?

00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:44.714
But start seeing their ceiling.

00:08:44.738 --> 00:08:46.876
They have a plastic shield and grass.

00:08:47.512 --> 00:08:49.867
They have the same kind of sofa,

00:08:49.891 --> 00:08:52.721
they store their grain in similar ways,

00:08:53.243 --> 00:08:55.095
they're going to have fish for dinner,

00:08:55.119 --> 00:08:58.447
and they're boiling their water
in identical ways.

00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:01.354
So if we would visit any of these homes,

00:09:01.378 --> 00:09:05.118
there's a huge risk
that we would say we know anything

00:09:05.142 --> 00:09:09.458
about the specific way you do things
in China or Nigeria,

00:09:09.482 --> 00:09:12.087
while, looking at this,
it's quite obvious --

00:09:12.111 --> 00:09:14.365
this is how you do things
on this income level.

00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:18.750
That is what you can see when you go
through the imagery in Dollar Street.

00:09:18.774 --> 00:09:20.958
So going back to the figures,

00:09:20.982 --> 00:09:23.178
the seven billion people of the world,

00:09:23.202 --> 00:09:25.146
now we're going to do a quick recap.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:29.082
We're going to look at comparisons
of things in the poorest group:

00:09:29.106 --> 00:09:30.425
beds,

00:09:30.449 --> 00:09:31.736
roofs,

00:09:32.569 --> 00:09:33.782
cooking.

00:09:33.806 --> 00:09:36.019
And observe, in all these comparisons,

00:09:36.043 --> 00:09:37.793
their homes are chosen

00:09:37.817 --> 00:09:40.517
so they are in completely
different places of the world.

00:09:40.541 --> 00:09:42.704
But what we see is pretty identical.

00:09:42.728 --> 00:09:44.469
So the poorest billion cooking

00:09:44.493 --> 00:09:47.467
would look somewhat
the same in these two places;

00:09:47.491 --> 00:09:49.210
you might not have shoes;

00:09:49.234 --> 00:09:51.114
eating, if you don't have a spoon;

00:09:51.667 --> 00:09:55.587
storing salt would be similar
whether you're in Asia or in Africa;

00:09:55.611 --> 00:09:58.817
and going to the toilet would be
pretty much the same experience

00:09:58.841 --> 00:10:00.834
whether you're in Nigeria or Nepal.

00:10:00.858 --> 00:10:04.306
In the middle, we have
a huge group of five billion,

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.676
but here we can see you will have
electric light, most likely;

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.652
you will no longer sleep on the floor;

00:10:09.676 --> 00:10:12.020
you will store your salt in a container;

00:10:12.044 --> 00:10:13.863
you will have more than one spoon;

00:10:13.887 --> 00:10:16.103
you will have more than one pen;

00:10:16.127 --> 00:10:18.773
the ceiling is no longer
leaking that much;

00:10:18.797 --> 00:10:20.362
you will have shoes;

00:10:20.386 --> 00:10:21.685
you might have a phone,

00:10:22.131 --> 00:10:23.285
toys,

00:10:23.309 --> 00:10:24.817
and produce waste.

00:10:24.841 --> 00:10:27.130
Coming to our group up here,

00:10:27.154 --> 00:10:30.017
similar shoes, Jordan, US.

00:10:30.041 --> 00:10:34.024
We have sofas, fruits, hairbrushes,

00:10:34.048 --> 00:10:35.230
bookshelves,

00:10:35.254 --> 00:10:38.118
toilet paper in Tanzania, Palestine,

00:10:38.142 --> 00:10:39.342
hard to distinguish

00:10:39.366 --> 00:10:43.739
if we would sit in US, Palestine
or Tanzania from this one.

00:10:43.763 --> 00:10:45.542
Vietnam, Kenya:

00:10:45.566 --> 00:10:50.554
wardrobes, lamps,
black dogs, floors, soap,

00:10:50.578 --> 00:10:53.136
laundry, clocks, computers,

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.316
phones, and so on, right?

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.583
So we have a lot of similarities
all over the world,

00:10:58.607 --> 00:11:00.981
and the images we see in the media,

00:11:01.005 --> 00:11:04.978
they show us the world
is a very, very strange place.

00:11:05.002 --> 00:11:07.289
But when we look
at the Dollar Street images,

00:11:07.313 --> 00:11:08.702
they do not look like that.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.507
So using Dollar Street,

00:11:11.531 --> 00:11:13.834
we can use photos as data,

00:11:13.858 --> 00:11:15.541
and country stereotypes --

00:11:15.565 --> 00:11:17.669
they simply fall apart.

00:11:18.294 --> 00:11:21.935
So the person staring back at us
from the other side of the world

00:11:21.959 --> 00:11:24.227
actually looks quite a lot like you.

00:11:24.804 --> 00:11:28.522
And that implies both a call to action

00:11:28.546 --> 00:11:30.031
and a reason for hope.

00:11:30.693 --> 00:11:31.860
Thank you.

00:11:31.884 --> 00:11:38.662
(Applause)
