00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:15.761
How can landscapes imbue memory?

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:21.226
When we think about
this notion "e pluribus unum" --

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.801
"out of many, one,"

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:25.987
it's a pretty strange concept, right?

00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:29.695
I mean, with all different races
and cultures of people,

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:31.830
how do you boil it down to one thing?

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:37.768
I want to share with you today
this idea of "e pluribus unum"

00:00:37.792 --> 00:00:44.448
and how our landscape might imbue
those memories of diverse perspectives,

00:00:44.472 --> 00:00:50.520
as well as force us to stop
trying to narrow things down

00:00:50.544 --> 00:00:53.941
to a single, clean set of identities.

00:00:54.614 --> 00:00:56.949
As an educator, designer,

00:00:57.695 --> 00:01:01.139
I'd like to share with you
five simple concepts

00:01:01.163 --> 00:01:03.269
that I've developed through my work.

00:01:03.293 --> 00:01:06.505
And I'd like to share
with you five projects

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:10.756
where we can begin to see
how the memory around us,

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.925
where things have happened,

00:01:12.949 --> 00:01:17.978
can actually force us to look
at one another in a different way.

00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:22.134
And lastly: this is not just
an American motto anymore.

00:01:22.158 --> 00:01:24.464
I think e pluribus unum is global.

00:01:24.835 --> 00:01:26.385
We're in this thing together.

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:32.532
First, great things happen
when we exist in each other's world --

00:01:32.556 --> 00:01:33.908
like today, right?

00:01:36.127 --> 00:01:37.862
The world of community gardens --

00:01:37.886 --> 00:01:40.258
most of you have probably
seen a community garden.

00:01:40.282 --> 00:01:42.853
They're all about subsistence
and food. Right?

00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:45.055
I'll tell you a little story,

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.453
what happened in New York
more than a decade ago.

00:01:47.477 --> 00:01:50.034
They tried to sell
all of their community gardens,

00:01:50.058 --> 00:01:54.694
and Bette Midler developed a nonprofit,
the New York Restoration Project.

00:01:54.718 --> 00:01:57.461
They literally brought all the gardens

00:01:57.485 --> 00:01:59.256
and decided to save them.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.789
And then they had another novel idea:

00:02:01.813 --> 00:02:05.221
let's bring in world-class designers

00:02:05.245 --> 00:02:08.584
and let them go out into communities
and make these beautiful gardens,

00:02:08.608 --> 00:02:10.989
and maybe they might not
just be about food.

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:14.197
And so they called me,

00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:16.831
and I designed one in Jamaica, Queens.

00:02:16.855 --> 00:02:19.168
And on the way to designing this garden,

00:02:19.192 --> 00:02:21.931
I went to the New York
Restoration Project Office,

00:02:21.955 --> 00:02:25.314
and I noticed a familiar name
on the door downstairs.

00:02:25.338 --> 00:02:27.107
I go upstairs, and I said,

00:02:27.131 --> 00:02:29.383
"Do you guys know who is downstairs?"

00:02:29.407 --> 00:02:31.081
And they said, "Gunit."

00:02:31.666 --> 00:02:33.229
And I said, "Gunit?

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:35.326
You mean G-Unit?

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.462
Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson?"

00:02:37.486 --> 00:02:38.666
(Laughter)

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.376
And they said, "Yeah?"

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.634
And I said, "Yes."

00:02:41.658 --> 00:02:44.480
And so we went downstairs,
and before you knew it,

00:02:45.294 --> 00:02:50.535
Curtis, Bette and the rest of them
formed this collaboration,

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:52.746
and they built this garden
in Jamaica, Queens.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.591
And it turned out Curtis, 50 Cent,
grew up in Jamaica.

00:02:56.615 --> 00:02:59.521
And so again, when you start
bringing these worlds together --

00:02:59.545 --> 00:03:00.983
me, Curtis, Bette --

00:03:01.007 --> 00:03:03.390
you get something more incredible.

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:05.213
You get a garden

00:03:05.237 --> 00:03:10.640
that last year was voted one of the top 10
secret gardens in New York.

00:03:10.664 --> 00:03:11.819
Right?

00:03:11.843 --> 00:03:12.995
(Applause)

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.449
It's for young and old,

00:03:15.602 --> 00:03:17.760
but more importantly, it's a place --

00:03:17.784 --> 00:03:20.198
there was a story in the Times
about six months ago

00:03:20.222 --> 00:03:24.545
where this young woman
found solace in going to the garden.

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.161
It had nothing to do with me.
It had more to do with 50, I'm sure,

00:03:28.185 --> 00:03:32.244
but it has inspired people
to think about gardens

00:03:32.268 --> 00:03:34.849
and sharing each other's worlds
in a different way.

00:03:36.242 --> 00:03:38.719
This next concept, "two-ness" --

00:03:39.397 --> 00:03:42.451
it's not as simple as I thought
it would be to explain,

00:03:43.531 --> 00:03:46.244
but as I left to go to college,
my father looked at me,

00:03:46.268 --> 00:03:49.596
and said, "Junior, you're going to have
to be both black and white

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.813
when you go out there."

00:03:50.837 --> 00:03:53.626
And if you go back to the early
parts of the 20th century,

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.716
W.E.B. Du Bois, the famous activist,

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.164
said it's this peculiar sensation

00:03:59.188 --> 00:04:02.466
that the Negro has to walk around

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.656
being viewed through the lens
of other people,

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.717
and this two-ness,
this double consciousness.

00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:12.951
And I want to argue that more
than a hundred years later,

00:04:12.975 --> 00:04:16.946
that two-ness has made us
strong and resilient,

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.209
and I would say for brown people, women --

00:04:19.233 --> 00:04:24.277
all of us who have had to navigate
the world through the eyes of others --

00:04:24.301 --> 00:04:28.200
we should now share that strength
to the rest of those

00:04:28.224 --> 00:04:30.731
who have had the privilege to be singular.

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:33.120
I'd like to share with you a project,

00:04:33.144 --> 00:04:36.570
because I do think this two-ness
can find itself in the world around us.

00:04:36.594 --> 00:04:40.106
And it's beginning to happen where
we're beginning to share these stories.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.611
At the University of Virginia,

00:04:41.635 --> 00:04:44.093
the academical village
by Thomas Jefferson,

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:49.258
it's a place that we're beginning
to notice now was built by African hands.

00:04:49.282 --> 00:04:50.942
So we have to begin to say,

00:04:50.966 --> 00:04:53.133
"OK, how do we talk about that?"

00:04:53.157 --> 00:04:56.115
As the University
was expanding to the south,

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.567
they found a site
that was the house of Kitty Foster,

00:05:01.591 --> 00:05:04.847
free African American woman.

00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:06.052
And she was there,

00:05:06.076 --> 00:05:07.302
and her descendants,

00:05:07.326 --> 00:05:08.867
they all lived there,

00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:11.676
and she cleaned for the boys of UVA.

00:05:12.757 --> 00:05:14.434
But as they found the archaeology,

00:05:14.458 --> 00:05:17.254
they asked me if I would do
a commemorative piece.

00:05:17.278 --> 00:05:20.107
So the two-ness of this landscape,
both black and white ...

00:05:20.131 --> 00:05:23.626
I decided to do a piece
based on shadows and light.

00:05:24.722 --> 00:05:27.480
And through that, we were able
to develop a shadow-catcher

00:05:27.504 --> 00:05:30.469
that would talk about this two-ness
in a different way.

00:05:30.493 --> 00:05:32.525
So when the light came down,

00:05:32.549 --> 00:05:35.197
there would be this ride to heaven.

00:05:35.221 --> 00:05:37.847
When there's no light, it's silent.

00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:40.505
And in the landscape of Thomas Jefferson,

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:42.204
it's a strange thing.

00:05:42.228 --> 00:05:44.453
It's not made of brick.

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:45.778
It's a strange thing,

00:05:45.802 --> 00:05:49.274
and it allows these two things
to be unresolved.

00:05:50.417 --> 00:05:52.875
And we don't have to resolve these things.

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:54.882
I want to live in a world

00:05:54.906 --> 00:05:56.422
where the resolution --

00:05:56.446 --> 00:05:58.478
there's an ambiguity between things,

00:05:58.502 --> 00:06:02.421
because that ambiguity
allows us to have a conversation.

00:06:03.215 --> 00:06:05.063
When things are clear and defined,

00:06:05.087 --> 00:06:06.514
we forget.

00:06:08.948 --> 00:06:11.022
The next example? Empathy.

00:06:11.527 --> 00:06:15.000
And I've heard that a couple of times
in this conference,

00:06:15.024 --> 00:06:16.688
this notion of caring.

00:06:17.546 --> 00:06:21.086
Twenty-five years ago,
when I was a young pup,

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.712
very optimistic,

00:06:22.736 --> 00:06:26.162
we wanted to design a park
in downtown Oakland, California

00:06:26.186 --> 00:06:27.652
for the homeless people.

00:06:27.676 --> 00:06:30.962
And we said, homeless people
can be in the same space

00:06:30.986 --> 00:06:32.743
as people who wear suits.

00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:35.466
And everyone was like,
"That's never going to work.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.545
People are not going to eat lunch
with the homeless people."

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:40.636
We built the park.

00:06:41.584 --> 00:06:43.960
It cost 1.1 million dollars.

00:06:43.984 --> 00:06:45.526
We wanted a bathroom.

00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:49.829
We wanted horseshoes,
barbecue pits, smokers,

00:06:49.853 --> 00:06:52.184
picnic tables, shelter and all of that.

00:06:52.208 --> 00:06:54.358
We had the design,
we went to the then-mayor

00:06:54.382 --> 00:06:58.124
and said, "Mr. Mayor, it's only
going to cost you 1.1 million dollars."

00:06:58.148 --> 00:06:59.440
And he looked at me.

00:07:00.392 --> 00:07:01.810
"For homeless people?"

00:07:03.158 --> 00:07:04.898
And he didn't give us the money.

00:07:04.922 --> 00:07:07.773
So we walked out, unfettered,
and we raised the money.

00:07:07.797 --> 00:07:09.804
Clorox gave us money.

00:07:09.828 --> 00:07:13.465
The National Park Service
built the bathroom.

00:07:13.489 --> 00:07:15.558
So we were able to go ahead

00:07:15.582 --> 00:07:17.528
because we had empathy.

00:07:17.552 --> 00:07:20.239
Now, 25 years later,

00:07:20.263 --> 00:07:24.847
we have an even larger
homeless problem in the Bay Area.

00:07:25.736 --> 00:07:27.864
But the park is still there,

00:07:27.888 --> 00:07:29.831
and the people are still there.

00:07:29.855 --> 00:07:31.698
So for me, that's a success.

00:07:31.722 --> 00:07:33.572
And when people see that,

00:07:33.596 --> 00:07:37.801
hopefully, they'll have empathy
for the people under freeways and tents,

00:07:37.825 --> 00:07:40.332
and why can't our public spaces

00:07:40.356 --> 00:07:44.214
house them and force us to be empathetic?

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.088
The image on the left
is Lafayette Square Park today.

00:07:48.112 --> 00:07:53.186
The image on the right is 1906,
Golden Gate Park after the earthquake.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.071
Why do we have to have cataclysmic events

00:07:56.769 --> 00:07:58.131
to be empathetic?

00:07:58.859 --> 00:08:01.342
Our fellow men are out there starving,

00:08:01.366 --> 00:08:04.946
women sleeping on the street,
and we don't see them.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:08.216
Put them in those spaces,
and they'll be visible.

00:08:09.936 --> 00:08:13.492
(Applause)

00:08:15.431 --> 00:08:19.284
And to show you that there are still
people out there with empathy,

00:08:19.308 --> 00:08:21.681
the Oakland Raiders' Bruce Irvin

00:08:21.705 --> 00:08:24.536
fries fish every Friday afternoon

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.322
for anyone who wants it.

00:08:26.714 --> 00:08:30.885
And by going to that park,
that park became the vehicle for him.

00:08:32.218 --> 00:08:34.848
The traditional belongs to all of us,

00:08:34.872 --> 00:08:36.242
and this is a simple one.

00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:40.951
You go into some neighborhoods --
beautiful architecture, beautiful parks --

00:08:40.975 --> 00:08:42.669
but if people look a different way,

00:08:42.693 --> 00:08:43.977
it's not traditional.

00:08:44.001 --> 00:08:48.073
It's not until they leave
and then new people come in

00:08:48.097 --> 00:08:50.341
where the traditional gets valued.

00:08:50.365 --> 00:08:51.808
A little quick story here:

00:08:52.572 --> 00:08:54.562
1888 opera house,

00:08:54.586 --> 00:08:56.529
the oldest in San Francisco,

00:08:56.553 --> 00:08:58.870
sits in Bayview–Hunters Point.

00:08:58.894 --> 00:09:00.869
Over its history,

00:09:00.893 --> 00:09:02.833
it's provided theater,

00:09:02.857 --> 00:09:06.778
places for businesses,
places for community gatherings, etc.

00:09:07.453 --> 00:09:11.399
It's also a place where Ruth Williams
taught many black actors.

00:09:11.423 --> 00:09:12.998
Think: Danny Glover --

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:16.094
came from this place.

00:09:16.118 --> 00:09:20.633
But over time, with our
1980s federal practices,

00:09:20.657 --> 00:09:24.681
a lot of these community institutions
fell into disrepair.

00:09:25.346 --> 00:09:30.014
With the San Francisco Arts Council,
we were able to raise money

00:09:30.038 --> 00:09:31.830
and to actually refurbish the place.

00:09:31.854 --> 00:09:33.972
And we were able to have
a community meeting.

00:09:33.996 --> 00:09:37.013
And within the community meeting,
people got up and said,

00:09:37.037 --> 00:09:40.230
"This place feels like a plantation.
Why are we locked in?

00:09:40.254 --> 00:09:41.748
Why can't we learn theater?"

00:09:41.772 --> 00:09:45.232
Over the years, people had started
putting in chicken coops, hay bales,

00:09:45.256 --> 00:09:47.260
community gardens and all of these things,

00:09:47.284 --> 00:09:50.071
and they could not see
that traditional thing behind them.

00:09:50.095 --> 00:09:52.451
But we said, we're bringing
the community back.

00:09:53.118 --> 00:09:56.876
American Disability Act -- we were able
to get five million dollars.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:01.427
And now, the tradition belongs
to these brown and black people,

00:10:01.451 --> 00:10:02.619
and they use it.

00:10:02.643 --> 00:10:04.083
And they learn theater,

00:10:04.107 --> 00:10:05.527
after-school programs.

00:10:05.551 --> 00:10:07.578
There's no more chickens.

00:10:07.602 --> 00:10:08.992
But there is art.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:14.995
And lastly, I want to share with you
a project that we're currently working on,

00:10:15.019 --> 00:10:18.877
and I think it will force us all
to remember in a really different way.

00:10:19.789 --> 00:10:22.811
There are lots of things
in the landscape around us,

00:10:22.835 --> 00:10:26.131
and most of the time we don't know
what's below the ground.

00:10:26.529 --> 00:10:28.975
Here in Charleston, South Carolina,

00:10:28.999 --> 00:10:30.292
a verdant piece of grass.

00:10:30.316 --> 00:10:32.994
Most people just pass by it daily.

00:10:33.018 --> 00:10:34.434
But underneath it,

00:10:35.223 --> 00:10:38.931
it's where they discovered
Gadsden’s Wharf.

00:10:39.773 --> 00:10:44.033
We think more than 40 percent
of the African diaspora landed here.

00:10:45.044 --> 00:10:46.789
How could you forget that?

00:10:47.843 --> 00:10:49.476
How could you forget?

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.016
So we dug, dug, and we found the wharf.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.083
And so in 2020,

00:10:55.107 --> 00:10:57.653
Harry Cobb and myself and others

00:10:57.677 --> 00:11:00.812
are building the International
African American Museum.

00:11:00.836 --> 00:11:02.716
And it will celebrate --

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:07.053
(Applause)

00:11:07.077 --> 00:11:11.048
this place where we know,
beneath the ground,

00:11:11.072 --> 00:11:13.345
thousands died, perished,

00:11:13.369 --> 00:11:15.595
the food chain of the bay changed.

00:11:15.619 --> 00:11:18.029
Sharks came closer to the bay.

00:11:18.651 --> 00:11:20.598
It's where slaves were stored.

00:11:21.305 --> 00:11:23.683
Imagine this hallowed ground.

00:11:23.707 --> 00:11:26.196
So in this new design,
the ground will erupt,

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:30.141
and it will talk about
this tension that sits below.

00:11:30.773 --> 00:11:34.265
The columns and the ground
is made of tabby shales

00:11:34.289 --> 00:11:35.844
scooped up from the Atlantic,

00:11:35.868 --> 00:11:38.471
a reminder of that awful crossing.

00:11:39.315 --> 00:11:41.819
And as you make your way through
on the other side,

00:11:41.843 --> 00:11:45.246
you are forced to walk through
the remains of the warehouse,

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.002
where slaves were stored

00:11:47.026 --> 00:11:49.882
on hot, sultry days, for days,

00:11:49.906 --> 00:11:51.148
and perished.

00:11:51.172 --> 00:11:53.674
And you'll have to come face-to-face

00:11:53.698 --> 00:11:55.588
with the Negro,

00:11:56.391 --> 00:11:58.983
who worked in the marshes,

00:11:59.007 --> 00:12:03.059
who was able to,
with the sickle-cell trait,

00:12:03.083 --> 00:12:06.761
able to stand in high waters
for long, long days.

00:12:07.204 --> 00:12:09.555
And at night, it'll be open 24/7,

00:12:09.579 --> 00:12:11.337
for everybody to experience.

00:12:11.868 --> 00:12:15.343
But we'll also talk about
those other beautiful things

00:12:15.367 --> 00:12:17.753
that my African ancestors
brought with them:

00:12:17.777 --> 00:12:19.080
a love of landscape,

00:12:19.104 --> 00:12:23.698
a respect for the spirits
that live in trees and rocks and water,

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.041
the ethnobotanical aspects,

00:12:27.065 --> 00:12:30.522
the plants that we use
for medicinal purposes.

00:12:31.621 --> 00:12:32.934
But more importantly,

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.983
we want to remind people
in Charleston, South Carolina,

00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:39.038
of the black bodies,

00:12:39.062 --> 00:12:41.307
because when you go to Charleston today,

00:12:41.331 --> 00:12:43.922
the Confederacy is celebrated,

00:12:43.946 --> 00:12:45.781
probably more than any other city,

00:12:46.527 --> 00:12:49.352
and you don't have a sense
of blackness at all.

00:12:49.828 --> 00:12:51.007
The Brookes map,

00:12:51.031 --> 00:12:55.367
which was an image
that helped abolitionists see

00:12:55.391 --> 00:12:58.490
and be merciful for that
condition of the crossing,

00:12:58.514 --> 00:13:00.929
is something that we want to repeat.

00:13:01.482 --> 00:13:03.908
And I was taken by the conceptuality

00:13:04.582 --> 00:13:07.724
of this kind of digital print that sits
in a museum in Charleston.

00:13:08.196 --> 00:13:13.073
So we decided to bring the water
up on top of the surface,

00:13:13.097 --> 00:13:15.189
seven feet above tide,

00:13:16.125 --> 00:13:20.722
and then cast the figures
full length, six feet,

00:13:20.746 --> 00:13:23.154
multiply them across the surface,

00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:24.543
in tabby,

00:13:24.567 --> 00:13:28.311
and then allow people
to walk across that divide.

00:13:28.822 --> 00:13:31.047
And hopefully, as people come,

00:13:31.071 --> 00:13:32.633
the water will drain out,

00:13:33.304 --> 00:13:34.519
fill up,

00:13:34.543 --> 00:13:36.473
drain out and fill up.

00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:43.161
And you'll be forced to come to terms
with that memory of place,

00:13:43.185 --> 00:13:45.062
that memory of that crossing,

00:13:45.086 --> 00:13:49.069
that at times seems very lucid and clear,

00:13:49.093 --> 00:13:54.048
but at other times, forces us
again to reconcile the scale.

00:13:55.471 --> 00:13:59.514
And hopefully, as people move
through this landscape every day,

00:13:59.538 --> 00:14:02.085
unreconciled, they'll remember,

00:14:02.109 --> 00:14:03.861
and hopefully when we remember,

00:14:04.567 --> 00:14:05.854
e pluribus unum.

00:14:05.878 --> 00:14:07.164
Thank you.

00:14:07.188 --> 00:14:11.134
(Applause)
