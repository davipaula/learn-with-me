00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:16.786
So I'm pretty sure that I'm not
the only one in this room

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.522
who at some point have found myself,
you know, looking up towards the stars,

00:00:21.546 --> 00:00:24.180
and wondered, you know, "Are we it,

00:00:24.204 --> 00:00:28.005
or are there other living planets
out there such as our own?"

00:00:29.014 --> 00:00:32.521
I guess it is possible
that I'm then the only person

00:00:32.545 --> 00:00:34.816
who has obsessed enough
about that question

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.458
to make it my career.

00:00:36.482 --> 00:00:38.482
But moving on.

00:00:38.506 --> 00:00:41.617
How do we get to this question?

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:44.008
Well, I would argue the first thing to do

00:00:44.032 --> 00:00:49.450
is to turn our eyes back down from the sky
to our own planet, the Earth.

00:00:50.173 --> 00:00:54.380
And think about just how lucky
did the Earth have to be

00:00:54.404 --> 00:00:56.626
to be the living planet it is.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.895
Well, it had to be
at least somewhat lucky.

00:00:58.919 --> 00:01:01.427
Had we been sitting closer to the Sun

00:01:01.451 --> 00:01:03.458
or a bit further away,

00:01:03.482 --> 00:01:07.998
any water that we have had
would have boiled off or frozen over.

00:01:08.022 --> 00:01:12.083
And I mean, it's not a given
that a planet has water on it.

00:01:12.107 --> 00:01:15.725
So had we been a dry planet,

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:18.083
there would not have been
a lot of life on it.

00:01:18.107 --> 00:01:21.664
And even if we had had all the water
that we have today,

00:01:21.688 --> 00:01:23.934
if that water had not been accompanied

00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:27.069
by the right kind of chemicals
to get life going,

00:01:27.093 --> 00:01:30.012
we would have a wet planet,
but just as dead.

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:32.577
So it's so many things that can go wrong,

00:01:32.601 --> 00:01:35.522
what are the chances that they go right?

00:01:35.546 --> 00:01:37.983
What are the chances that the planet forms

00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:40.657
with at least the basic ingredients needed

00:01:40.681 --> 00:01:43.281
to have an origins of life happening?

00:01:44.515 --> 00:01:47.166
Well, let's explore that together.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.237
So if you're going to have
a living planet,

00:01:49.261 --> 00:01:52.667
the first thing you're going to need

00:01:52.691 --> 00:01:54.483
is a planet.

00:01:54.507 --> 00:01:55.508
(Laughter)

00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:57.656
But not any planet will do.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.458
You're probably going to need
a rather specific and earthlike planet.

00:02:01.482 --> 00:02:02.974
A planet that is rocky,

00:02:02.998 --> 00:02:05.106
so you can have both oceans and land,

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.362
and it's sitting neither too close
nor too far away from its star,

00:02:09.386 --> 00:02:11.838
but at the just-right temperature.

00:02:11.862 --> 00:02:15.157
And it's just right
for liquid water, that is.

00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:18.276
So how many of these planets
do we have in our galaxy?

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.268
Well, one of the great discoveries
of the past decades

00:02:22.292 --> 00:02:24.772
is that planets are incredibly common.

00:02:25.212 --> 00:02:28.212
Almost every star
has a planet around them.

00:02:28.236 --> 00:02:29.649
Some have many.

00:02:29.673 --> 00:02:32.562
And among these planets,

00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:36.426
on the order of a few percent
are earthlike enough

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.006
that we would consider them
potentially living planets.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.665
So having the right kind of planet
is actually not that difficult

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.927
when we consider that there's
about 100 billion stars in our galaxy.

00:02:47.951 --> 00:02:52.046
So that gives you about a billion
potential living planets.

00:02:52.427 --> 00:02:55.013
But it's not enough to just be
at the right temperature

00:02:55.037 --> 00:02:56.847
or have the right overall composition.

00:02:56.871 --> 00:02:59.138
You also need the right chemicals.

00:02:59.553 --> 00:03:03.768
And what the second and important
ingredient to make a living planet is --

00:03:03.792 --> 00:03:06.720
I think it's pretty intuitive --

00:03:06.744 --> 00:03:08.331
it's water.

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:13.498
After all, we did define our planet
as being potentially living

00:03:13.522 --> 00:03:16.202
if it had the right temperature
to keep water liquid.

00:03:16.838 --> 00:03:20.409
And I mean, here on Earth,
life is water-based.

00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:22.005
But more generally,

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:26.283
water is just really good
as a meeting place for chemicals.

00:03:26.307 --> 00:03:28.307
It is a very special liquid.

00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:31.911
So this is our second basic ingredient.

00:03:32.276 --> 00:03:34.208
Now the third ingredient, I think,

00:03:34.232 --> 00:03:36.847
is probably a little bit more surprising.

00:03:36.871 --> 00:03:39.656
I mean, we are going to need
some organics in there,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.814
since we are thinking about organic life.

00:03:42.188 --> 00:03:43.902
But the organic molecule

00:03:43.926 --> 00:03:47.705
that seems to be at the center
of the chemical networks

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:52.155
that can produce biomolecules
is hydrogen cyanide.

00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:55.814
So for those of you who know
what this molecule is like,

00:03:55.838 --> 00:03:59.219
you know it's something
that it's a good idea to stay away from.

00:03:59.776 --> 00:04:00.927
But it turns out

00:04:00.951 --> 00:04:04.117
that what's really, really bad
for advanced life forms,

00:04:04.141 --> 00:04:05.799
such as yourselves,

00:04:05.823 --> 00:04:09.307
is really, really good
to get the chemistry started,

00:04:09.331 --> 00:04:12.616
the right kind of chemistry
that can lead to origins of life.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.983
So now we have our three
ingredients that we need,

00:04:16.007 --> 00:04:18.007
you know, the temperate planet,

00:04:18.031 --> 00:04:20.579
water and hydrogen cyanide.

00:04:20.603 --> 00:04:23.372
So how often do these three come together?

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:26.045
How many temperate planets
are there out there

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:28.536
that have water and hydrogen cyanide?

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.688
Well, in an ideal world,

00:04:30.712 --> 00:04:36.688
we would now turn one of our telescopes
towards one of these temperate planets

00:04:36.712 --> 00:04:38.275
and check for ourselves.

00:04:38.299 --> 00:04:41.933
Just, "Do these planets have water
and cyanides on them?"

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:48.663
Unfortunately, we don't yet
have large enough telescopes to do this.

00:04:48.687 --> 00:04:52.569
We can detect molecules
in the atmospheres of some planets.

00:04:52.593 --> 00:04:54.196
But these are large planets

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.680
sitting often pretty close to their star,

00:04:56.704 --> 00:04:59.490
nothing like these, you know,
just-right planets

00:04:59.514 --> 00:05:00.980
that we're talking about here,

00:05:01.004 --> 00:05:03.196
which are much smaller and further away.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.704
So we have to come up with another way.

00:05:05.728 --> 00:05:10.662
And the other way that we have
conceived of and then followed

00:05:10.686 --> 00:05:13.305
is to instead of looking
for these molecules

00:05:13.329 --> 00:05:15.519
in the planets when they exist,

00:05:15.543 --> 00:05:19.283
is to look for them in the material
that's forming new planets.

00:05:19.307 --> 00:05:23.752
So planets form in discs
of dust and gas around young stars.

00:05:23.776 --> 00:05:27.895
And these discs get their material
from the interstellar medium.

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.633
Turns out that the empty space
you see between stars

00:05:30.657 --> 00:05:34.391
when you are looking up towards them,
asking existential questions,

00:05:34.415 --> 00:05:36.590
is not as empty as it seems,

00:05:36.614 --> 00:05:38.574
but actually full of gas and dust,

00:05:38.598 --> 00:05:40.844
which can, you know,
come together in clouds,

00:05:40.868 --> 00:05:44.223
then collapses to form these discs,
stars and planets.

00:05:44.967 --> 00:05:49.538
And one of the things we always see
when we do look at these clouds

00:05:49.562 --> 00:05:50.967
is water.

00:05:50.991 --> 00:05:53.665
You know, I think we have a tendency
to think about water

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:56.289
as something that's,
you know, special to us.

00:05:56.852 --> 00:06:00.661
Water is one of the most abundant
molecules in the universe,

00:06:00.685 --> 00:06:02.410
including in these clouds,

00:06:02.434 --> 00:06:04.901
these star- and planet-forming clouds.

00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:06.815
And not only that --

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:08.815
water is also a pretty robust molecule:

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:11.236
it's actually not that easy to destroy.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.339
So a lot of this water
that is in interstellar medium

00:06:14.363 --> 00:06:19.950
will survive the rather dangerous,
collapsed journey from clouds

00:06:19.974 --> 00:06:22.156
to disc, to planet.

00:06:22.967 --> 00:06:25.046
So water is alright.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.927
That second ingredient
is not going to be a problem.

00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:32.173
Most planets are going to form
with some access to water.

00:06:33.125 --> 00:06:35.458
So what about hydrogen cyanide?

00:06:35.482 --> 00:06:39.990
Well, we also see cyanides
and other similar organic molecules

00:06:40.014 --> 00:06:42.601
in these interstellar clouds.

00:06:42.625 --> 00:06:47.910
But here, we're less certain
about the molecules surviving,

00:06:47.934 --> 00:06:49.942
going from the cloud to the disc.

00:06:49.966 --> 00:06:52.633
They're just a bit more delicate,
a bit more fragile.

00:06:52.657 --> 00:06:55.992
So if we're going to know
that this hydrogen cyanide

00:06:56.016 --> 00:06:59.222
is sitting in the vicinity
of new planets forming,

00:06:59.246 --> 00:07:01.540
we'd really need to see it
in the disc itself,

00:07:01.564 --> 00:07:03.794
in these planet-forming discs.

00:07:03.818 --> 00:07:06.260
So about a decade ago,

00:07:06.284 --> 00:07:11.522
I started a program
to look for this hydrogen cyanide

00:07:11.546 --> 00:07:14.722
and other molecules
in these planet-forming discs.

00:07:14.746 --> 00:07:17.983
And this is what we found.

00:07:18.007 --> 00:07:20.928
So good news, in these six images,

00:07:20.952 --> 00:07:27.069
those bright pixels represent emissions
originating from hydrogen cyanide

00:07:27.093 --> 00:07:30.577
in planet-forming discs
hundreds of light-years away

00:07:30.601 --> 00:07:32.625
that have made it to our telescope,

00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:33.926
onto the detector,

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.684
allowing us to see it like this.

00:07:37.228 --> 00:07:38.506
So the very good news

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:42.601
is that these discs do indeed have
hydrogen cyanide in them.

00:07:42.625 --> 00:07:46.024
That last, more elusive ingredient.

00:07:47.159 --> 00:07:52.215
Now the bad news is that we don't know
where in the disc it is.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.207
If we look at these,

00:07:54.231 --> 00:07:56.530
I mean, no one can say
they are beautiful images,

00:07:56.554 --> 00:07:59.316
even at the time when we got them.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:02.760
You see the pixel size is pretty big

00:08:02.784 --> 00:08:05.911
and it's actually bigger
than these discs themselves.

00:08:05.935 --> 00:08:07.391
So each pixel here

00:08:07.415 --> 00:08:10.895
represents something that's much bigger
than our solar system.

00:08:11.345 --> 00:08:13.276
And that means

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.410
that we don't know where in the disc
the hydrogen cyanide is coming from.

00:08:17.768 --> 00:08:18.998
And that's a problem,

00:08:19.022 --> 00:08:20.571
because these temperate planets,

00:08:20.595 --> 00:08:23.553
they can't access
hydrogen cyanide just anywhere,

00:08:23.577 --> 00:08:26.954
but it must be fairly close
to where they assemble

00:08:26.978 --> 00:08:28.868
for them to have access to it.

00:08:28.892 --> 00:08:34.034
So to bring this home,
let's think about an analogous example,

00:08:34.058 --> 00:08:37.280
that is, of cypress growing
in the United States.

00:08:37.661 --> 00:08:39.371
So let's say, hypothetically,

00:08:39.395 --> 00:08:41.166
that you've returned from Europe

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.934
where you have seen
beautiful Italian cypresses,

00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.371
and you want to understand, you know,

00:08:46.395 --> 00:08:49.014
does it make sense to import them
to the United States.

00:08:49.038 --> 00:08:50.672
Could you grow them here?

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:52.760
So you talk to the cypress experts,

00:08:52.784 --> 00:08:54.448
they tell you that there is indeed

00:08:54.472 --> 00:08:58.410
a band of not-too-hot, not-too-cold
across the United States

00:08:58.434 --> 00:08:59.974
where you could grow them.

00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:03.896
And if you have a nice,
high-resolution map or image like this,

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.745
it's quite easy to see
that this cypress strip

00:09:06.769 --> 00:09:10.229
overlaps with a lot of green
fertile land pixels.

00:09:10.753 --> 00:09:13.720
Even if I start degrading
this map quite a bit,

00:09:13.744 --> 00:09:16.053
making it lower and lower resolution,

00:09:16.077 --> 00:09:17.409
it's still possible to tell

00:09:17.433 --> 00:09:21.027
that there's going to be some fertile land
overlapping with this strip.

00:09:21.466 --> 00:09:26.497
But what about if the whole United States

00:09:26.521 --> 00:09:29.727
is incorporated into a single pixel?

00:09:29.751 --> 00:09:31.768
If the resolution is that low.

00:09:31.792 --> 00:09:33.085
What do you do now,

00:09:33.109 --> 00:09:38.231
how do you now tell whether you can grow
cypresses in the United States?

00:09:38.538 --> 00:09:40.466
Well the answer is you can't.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.878
I mean, there's definitely
some fertile land there,

00:09:42.902 --> 00:09:45.656
or you wouldn't have
that green tint to the pixel,

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.649
but there's just no way of telling

00:09:47.673 --> 00:09:50.871
whether any of that green
is in the right place.

00:09:50.895 --> 00:09:53.663
And that is exactly the problem
we were facing

00:09:53.687 --> 00:09:56.879
with our single-pixel
images of these discs

00:09:56.903 --> 00:09:58.498
with hydrogen cyanide.

00:09:58.522 --> 00:10:00.696
So what we need is something analogous,

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.791
at least those low-resolution maps
that I just showed you,

00:10:03.815 --> 00:10:08.664
to be able to tell whether there's overlap
between where the hydrogen cyanide is

00:10:08.688 --> 00:10:11.648
and where these planets
can access it as they are forming.

00:10:12.236 --> 00:10:15.439
So coming to the rescue, a few years ago,

00:10:15.463 --> 00:10:19.447
is this new, amazing,
beautiful telescope ALMA,

00:10:19.471 --> 00:10:22.328
the Atacama Large Millimeter
and submillimeter Array

00:10:22.352 --> 00:10:23.552
in northern Chile.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.663
So, ALMA is amazing
in many different ways,

00:10:27.687 --> 00:10:30.171
but the one that I'm going to focus on

00:10:30.195 --> 00:10:34.116
is that, as you can see,
I call this one telescope,

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.475
but you can there are actually
many dishes in this image.

00:10:37.499 --> 00:10:42.126
And this is a telescope
that consists of 66 individual dishes

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.750
that all work in unison.

00:10:44.483 --> 00:10:47.046
And that means that you have a telescope

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:51.937
that is the size of the largest distance
that you can put these dishes

00:10:51.961 --> 00:10:53.278
away from one another.

00:10:53.302 --> 00:10:56.405
Which in ALMA's case are a few miles.

00:10:56.429 --> 00:10:59.897
So you have a more
than mile-sized telescope.

00:11:00.267 --> 00:11:02.140
And when you have such a big telescope,

00:11:02.164 --> 00:11:04.665
you can zoom in on really small things,

00:11:04.689 --> 00:11:09.561
including making maps of hydrogen cyanide
in these planet-forming discs.

00:11:09.585 --> 00:11:12.410
So when ALMA came online a few years ago,

00:11:12.434 --> 00:11:16.507
that was one of the first things
that I proposed that we use it for.

00:11:17.086 --> 00:11:21.022
And what does a map of hydrogen cyanide
look like in a disc?

00:11:21.046 --> 00:11:23.560
Is the hydrogen cyanide
at the right place?

00:11:23.584 --> 00:11:25.695
And the answer is that it is.

00:11:25.719 --> 00:11:27.726
So this is the map.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:31.694
You see the hydrogen cyanide emission
being spread out across the disc.

00:11:31.718 --> 00:11:33.568
First of all, it's almost everywhere,

00:11:33.592 --> 00:11:35.155
which is very good news.

00:11:35.179 --> 00:11:38.364
But you have a lot
of extra bright emission

00:11:38.388 --> 00:11:41.591
coming from close to the star
towards the center of the disc.

00:11:41.965 --> 00:11:45.125
And this is exactly
where we want to see it.

00:11:45.149 --> 00:11:47.791
This is close to where
these planets are forming.

00:11:47.815 --> 00:11:51.601
And this is not what we see
just towards one disc --

00:11:51.625 --> 00:11:53.982
here are three more examples.

00:11:54.006 --> 00:11:56.089
You can see they all show
the same thing --

00:11:56.113 --> 00:11:58.577
lots of bright hydrogen cyanide emission

00:11:58.601 --> 00:12:00.926
coming from close
to the center of the star.

00:12:01.228 --> 00:12:03.910
For full disclosure,
we don't always see this.

00:12:03.934 --> 00:12:06.466
There are discs where we see the opposite,

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:09.712
where there's actually a hole
in the emission towards the center.

00:12:09.736 --> 00:12:12.276
So this is the opposite
of what we want to see, right?

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.458
This is not places where we could research

00:12:14.482 --> 00:12:18.490
if there is any hydrogen cyanide around
where these planets are forming.

00:12:18.514 --> 00:12:20.093
But in most cases,

00:12:20.117 --> 00:12:22.125
we just don't detect hydrogen cyanide,

00:12:22.149 --> 00:12:24.549
but we detect it in the right place.

00:12:25.038 --> 00:12:27.077
So what does all this mean?

00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:29.547
Well, I told you in the beginning

00:12:29.571 --> 00:12:32.958
that we have lots
of these temperate planets,

00:12:32.982 --> 00:12:34.887
maybe a billion or so of them,

00:12:34.911 --> 00:12:37.433
that could have life develop on them

00:12:37.457 --> 00:12:39.981
if they have the right ingredients.

00:12:40.005 --> 00:12:41.179
And I've also shown

00:12:41.203 --> 00:12:45.078
that we think a lot of the time,
the right ingredients are there --

00:12:45.102 --> 00:12:47.281
we have water, we have hydrogen cyanide,

00:12:47.305 --> 00:12:49.506
there will be other
organic molecules as well

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:51.197
coming with the cyanides.

00:12:51.879 --> 00:12:56.101
This means that planets
with the most basic ingredients for life

00:12:56.125 --> 00:12:59.148
are likely to be incredibly
common in our galaxy.

00:13:00.133 --> 00:13:02.688
And if all it takes for life to develop

00:13:02.712 --> 00:13:06.014
is to have these basic
ingredients available,

00:13:06.038 --> 00:13:08.901
there should be a lot
of living planets out there.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.337
But that is of course a big if.

00:13:11.361 --> 00:13:14.313
And I would say the challenge
of the next decades,

00:13:14.337 --> 00:13:16.821
for both astronomy and chemistry,

00:13:16.845 --> 00:13:19.585
is to figure out just how often

00:13:19.609 --> 00:13:22.363
we go from having
a potentially living planet

00:13:22.387 --> 00:13:24.791
to having an actually living one.

00:13:24.815 --> 00:13:25.966
Thank you.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:30.825
(Applause)
