00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.000
I'm an artist.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.880
Being an artist
is the greatest job there is.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.056
And I really pity
each and every one of you

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.776
who has to spend your days
discovering new galaxies

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.456
or saving humanity from global warming.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.936
(Laughter)

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.880
But being an artist
is also a daunting job.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.480
I spend every day,
from nine to six, doing this.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.096
(Laughter)

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.096
I even started a side career
that consists entirely

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.936
of complaining about the difficulty
of the creative process.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.056
(Laughter)

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.840
But today, I don't want to talk
about what makes my life difficult.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.096
I want to talk about what makes it easy.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.616
And that is you --

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.296
and the fact that
you are fluent in a language

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.178
that you're probably not even aware of.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.560
You're fluent in the language
of reading images.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.176
Deciphering an image like that

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.256
takes quite a bit
of an intellectual effort.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.496
But nobody ever taught you how this works,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.760
you just know it.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.376
College, shopping, music.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.176
What makes a language powerful
is that you can take a very complex idea

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.080
and communicate it
in a very simple, efficient form.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.960
These images represent
exactly the same ideas.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.096
But when you look, for example,
at the college hat,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.536
you know that this doesn't represent
the accessory you wear on your head

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.416
when you're being handed your diploma,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.240
but rather the whole idea of college.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.176
Now, what drawings can do
is they cannot only communicate images,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.016
they can even evoke emotions.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.336
Let's say you get to
an unfamiliar place and you see this.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.936
You feel happiness and relief.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.736
(Laughter)

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.176
Or a slight sense of unease
or maybe downright panic.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.736
(Laughter)

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.216
Or blissful peace and quiet.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.856
(Laughter)

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.320
But visuals, they're of course
more than just graphic icons.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.736
You know, if I want to tell the story
of modern-day struggle,

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.976
I would start with the armrest
between two airplane seats

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.136
and two sets of elbows fighting.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.056
What I love there is this universal law

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.496
that, you know, you have
30 seconds to fight it out

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.696
and once it's yours, you get to keep it
for the rest of the flight.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.816
(Laughter)

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.736
Now, commercial flight
is full of these images.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.256
If I want to illustrate
the idea of discomfort,

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.176
nothing better than these neck pillows.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.256
They're designed
to make you more comfortable --

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.096
(Laughter)

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.336
except they don't.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.320
(Laughter)

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.640
So I never sleep on airplanes.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.976
What I do occasionally
is I fall into a sort of painful coma.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.496
And when I wake up from that,

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.176
I have the most terrible
taste in my mouth.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.536
It's a taste that's so bad,
it cannot be described with words,

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.936
but it can be drawn.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.896
(Laughter)

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.520
The thing is, you know, I love sleeping.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.896
And when I sleep, I really
prefer to do it while spooning.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.856
I've been spooning on almost a pro level
for close to 20 years,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.776
but in all this time,
I've never figured out

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.456
what to do with that bottom arm.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.096
(Laughter)

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.056
(Applause)

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.360
And the only thing --

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.496
the only thing that makes sleeping
even more complicated

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.216
than trying to do it on an airplane

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.800
is when you have small children.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.080
They show up at your bed at around 4am

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.256
with some bogus excuse of,
"I had a bad dream."

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.536
(Laughter)

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.506
And then, of course you feel
sorry for them, they're your kids,

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.946
so you let them into your bed.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.675
And I have to admit, at the beginning,
they're really cute and warm and snugly.

00:04:03.685 --> 00:04:06.856
The minute you fall back asleep,
they inexplicably --

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.536
(Laughter)

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.816
start rotating.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.416
(Laughter)

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.393
We like to call this the helicopter mode.

00:04:14.417 --> 00:04:16.256
(Laughter)

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.296
Now, the deeper something is etched
into your consciousness,

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.680
the fewer details we need
to have an emotional reaction.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.216
(Laughter)

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.160
So why does an image like this work?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.616
It works, because we as readers

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.880
are incredibly good
at filling in the blanks.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.016
Now, when you draw,
there's this concept of negative space.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.936
And the idea is, that instead
of drawing the actual object,

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.976
you draw the space around it.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.400
So the bowls in this drawing are empty.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.240
But the black ink prompts your brain
to project food into a void.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.360
What we see here is not a owl flying.

00:05:00.113 --> 00:05:02.256
What we actually see
is a pair of AA batteries

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.456
standing on a nonsensical drawing,

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.016
and I animate the scene
by moving my desk lamp up and down.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.096
(Laughter)

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.720
The image really only exists in your mind.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.760
So, how much information do we need
to trigger such an image?

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.120
My goal as an artist
is to use the smallest amount possible.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.936
I try to achieve a level of simplicity

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.376
where, if you were to take away
one more element,

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.440
the whole concept would just collapse.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.160
And that's why my personal favorite tool
as an artist is abstraction.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.536
I've come up with this system
which I call the abstract-o-meter,

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.896
and this is how it works.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.816
So you take a symbol, any symbol,
for example the heart and the arrow,

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.656
which most of us would read
as the symbol for love,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.496
and I'm an artist, so I can draw this

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.480
in any given degree
of realism or abstraction.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.696
Now, if I go too realistic on it,
it just grosses everybody out.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.736
(Laughter)

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.696
If I go too far on the other side
and do very abstract,

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.976
nobody has any idea
what they're looking at.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.376
So I have to find
the perfect place on that scale,

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.440
in this case it's somewhere in the middle.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.840
Now, once we have reduced an image
to a more simple form,

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.200
all sorts of new connections
become possible.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.536
And that allows for totally
new angles in storytelling.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.936
(Laughter)

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.416
And so, what I like to do is,

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.640
I like to take images from really remote
cultural areas and bring them together.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.376
Now, with more daring references --

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.056
(Laughter)

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.800
I can have more fun.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.536
But of course, I know that eventually
things become so obscure

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.456
that I start losing some of you.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.096
So as a designer, it's absolutely key
to have a good understanding

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.440
of the visual and cultural
vocabulary of your audience.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.256
With this image here,
a comment on the Olympics in Athens,

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.376
I assumed that the reader
of the "New Yorker"

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.336
would have some rudimentary
idea of Greek art.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.200
If you don't, the image doesn't work.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.616
But if you do, you might
even appreciate the small detail,

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.496
like the beer-can pattern here
on the bottom of the vase.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.200
(Laughter)

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.736
A recurring discussion I have
with magazine editors,

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.736
who are usually word people,

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.360
is that their audience, you,

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.896
are much better at making
radical leaps with images

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.640
than they're being given credit for.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.536
And the only thing I find frustrating
is that they often seem to push me

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.136
towards a small set
of really tired visual clichés

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.776
that are considered safe.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.776
You know, it's the businessman
climbing up a ladder,

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.896
and then the ladder moves,
morphs into a stock market graph,

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.336
and anything with dollar signs;
that's always good.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.976
(Laughter)

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.816
If there are editorial decision makers
here in the audience,

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.616
I want to give you a piece of advice.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.536
Every time a drawing
like this is published,

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.416
a baby panda will die.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.536
(Laughter)

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.776
Literally.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.136
(Laughter)

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.736
(Applause)

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.056
When is a visual cliché good or bad?

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.896
It's a fine line.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.216
And it really depends on the story.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.976
In 2011, during the earthquake
and the tsunami in Japan,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.176
I was thinking of a cover.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.656
And I went through the classic symbols:

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.976
the Japanese flag,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.360
"The Great Wave" by Hokusai,
one of the greatest drawings ever.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.136
And then the story changed

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.320
when the situation at the power plant
in Fukushima got out of hand.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.816
And I remember these TV images
of the workers in hazmat suits,

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.296
just walking through the site,

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.976
and what struck me
was how quiet and serene it was.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.400
And so I wanted to create an image
of a silent catastrophe.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.920
And that's the image I came up with.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.736
(Applause)

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:01.976
Thank you.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.640
(Applause)

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.600
What I want to do is create
an aha moment, for you, for the reader.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.016
And unfortunately, that does not mean

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.560
that I have an aha moment
when I create these images.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.776
I never sit at my desk

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.760
with the proverbial light bulb
going off in my head.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.016
What it takes is actually a very slow,

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.456
unsexy process of minimal design decisions

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.800
that then, when I'm lucky,
lead to a good idea.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.616
So one day, I'm on a train,
and I'm trying to decode

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.840
the graphic rules for drops on a window.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.776
And eventually I realize,

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.296
"Oh, it's the background
blurry upside-down,

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.696
contained in a sharp image."

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.596
And I thought, wow, that's really cool,

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:47.986
and I have absolutely no idea
what to do with that.

00:09:48.016 --> 00:09:50.176
A while later, I'm back in New York,

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.560
and I draw this image of being stuck
on the Brooklyn bridge in a traffic jam.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.600
It's really annoying,
but also kind of poetic.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.216
And only later I realized,

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.520
I can take both of these ideas
and put them together in this idea.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.880
And what I want to do
is not show a realistic scene.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.736
But, maybe like poetry,

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.216
make you aware that you
already had this image with you,

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.096
but only now I've unearthed it

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.720
and made you realize that you
were carrying it with you all along.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.096
But like poetry,
this is a very delicate process

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.480
that is neither efficient
nor scalable, I think.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.256
And maybe the most
important skill for an artist

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.480
is really empathy.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.696
You need craft and you need --

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.256
(Laughter)

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.536
you need creativity --

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.096
(Laughter)

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.336
thank you --

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.496
to come up with an image like that.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.776
But then you need to step back

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.920
and look at what you've done
from the perspective of the reader.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.560
I've tried to become a better artist
by becoming a better observer of images.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.616
And for that, I started
an exercise for myself

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.856
which I call Sunday sketching,

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:08.976
which meant, on a Sunday, I would take
a random object I found around the house

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.416
and try to see if that object
could trigger an idea

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.360
that had nothing to do
with the original purpose of that item.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.160
And it usually just means
I'm blank for a long while.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.696
And the only trick that eventually works
is if I open my mind

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.056
and run through every image
I have stored up there,

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.640
and see if something clicks.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:35.016
And if it does, just add
a few lines of ink to connect --

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.960
to preserve this very short
moment of inspiration.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.496
And the great lesson there

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.736
was that the real magic
doesn't happen on paper.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.560
It happens in the mind of the viewer.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:53.960
When your expectations and your knowledge
clash with my artistic intentions.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.856
Your interaction with an image,

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:03.176
your ability to read, question,
be bothered or bored or inspired

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.416
by an image

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.880
is as important
as my artistic contribution.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.200
Because that's what turns
an artistic statement

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.320
really, into a creative dialogue.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.496
And so, your skill at reading images

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.760
is not only amazing,

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.400
it is what makes my art possible.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.336
And for that, I thank you very much.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.456
(Applause)

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:35.080
(Cheers)

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.216
Thank you.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:41.080
(Applause)
