00:00:08.306 --> 00:00:11.045
Around 1159 A.D.,

00:00:11.045 --> 00:00:13.626
a mathematician called 
Bhaskara the Learned

00:00:13.626 --> 00:00:19.996
sketched a design for a wheel
containing curved reservoirs of mercury.

00:00:19.996 --> 00:00:22.179
He reasoned that as the wheels spun,

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.797
the mercury would flow to the bottom
of each reservoir,

00:00:25.797 --> 00:00:30.217
leaving one side of the wheel
perpetually heavier than the other.

00:00:30.217 --> 00:00:34.637
The imbalance would keep
the wheel turning forever.

00:00:34.637 --> 00:00:37.566
Bhaskara's drawing was one of
the earliest designs

00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:40.097
for a perpetual motion machine,

00:00:40.097 --> 00:00:46.737
a device that can do work indefinitely
without any external energy source.

00:00:46.737 --> 00:00:52.318
Imagine a windmill that produced
the breeze it needed to keep rotating.

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:57.371
Or a lightbulb whose glow provided
its own electricity.

00:00:57.371 --> 00:01:01.179
These devices have captured many
inventors' imaginations

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:05.470
because they could transform 
our relationship with energy.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.999
For example, if you could build 
a perpetual motion machine

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:12.829
that included humans as part of its
perfectly efficient system,

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.250
it could sustain life indefinitely.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.269
There's just one problem.

00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:20.359
They don't work.

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:22.389
Ideas for perpetual motion machines

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:27.410
all violate one or more 
fundamental laws of thermodynamics,

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.649
the branch of physics that describes
the relationship

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.540
between different forms of energy.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.440
The first law of thermodynamics says
that energy can't be created or destroyed.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.580
You can't get out more energy
than you put in.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.461
That rules out a useful
perpetual motion machine right away

00:01:45.461 --> 00:01:50.381
because a machine could only ever
produce as much energy as it consumed.

00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:54.751
There wouldn't be any left over
to power a car or charge a phone.

00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:59.501
But what if you just wanted the machine
to keep itself moving?

00:01:59.501 --> 00:02:01.881
Inventors have proposed plenty of ideas.

00:02:01.881 --> 00:02:06.951
Several of these have been variations
on Bhaskara's over-balanced wheel

00:02:06.951 --> 00:02:11.582
with rolling balls 
or weights on swinging arms.

00:02:11.582 --> 00:02:13.241
None of them work.

00:02:13.241 --> 00:02:16.081
The moving parts that make one
side of the wheel heavier

00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:21.243
also shift its center of mass downward
below the axle.

00:02:21.243 --> 00:02:22.753
With a low center of mass,

00:02:22.753 --> 00:02:26.052
the wheel just swings back and forth
like a pendulum,

00:02:26.052 --> 00:02:28.105
then stops.

00:02:28.105 --> 00:02:30.372
What about a different approach?

00:02:30.372 --> 00:02:33.692
In the 17th century, Robert Boyle
came up with an idea

00:02:33.692 --> 00:02:36.413
for a self-watering pot.

00:02:36.413 --> 00:02:39.303
He theorized that capillary action,

00:02:39.303 --> 00:02:42.032
the attraction 
between liquids and surfaces

00:02:42.032 --> 00:02:44.853
that pulls water through thin tubes,

00:02:44.853 --> 00:02:49.463
might keep the water cycling
around the bowl.

00:02:49.463 --> 00:02:53.013
But if the capillary action is strong
enough to overcome gravity

00:02:53.013 --> 00:02:54.733
and draw the water up,

00:02:54.733 --> 00:02:59.294
it would also prevent it from falling
back into the bowl.

00:02:59.294 --> 00:03:03.485
Then there are versions with magnets,
like this set of ramps.

00:03:03.485 --> 00:03:07.364
The ball is supposed to be pulled
upwards by the magnet at the top,

00:03:07.364 --> 00:03:09.175
fall back down through the hole,

00:03:09.175 --> 00:03:11.352
and repeat the cycle.

00:03:11.352 --> 00:03:14.396
This one fails because like
the self-watering pot,

00:03:14.396 --> 00:03:18.176
the magnet would simply hold
the ball at the top.

00:03:18.176 --> 00:03:20.435
Even if it somehow did keep moving,

00:03:20.435 --> 00:03:23.176
the magnet's strength 
would degrade over time

00:03:23.176 --> 00:03:25.897
and eventually stop working.

00:03:25.897 --> 00:03:28.431
For each of these machines to keep moving,

00:03:28.431 --> 00:03:30.745
they'd have to create some extra energy

00:03:30.745 --> 00:03:34.076
to nudge the system 
past its stopping point,

00:03:34.076 --> 00:03:37.596
breaking the first law of thermodynamics.

00:03:37.596 --> 00:03:39.687
There are ones that seem to keep going,

00:03:39.687 --> 00:03:43.148
but in reality, they invariably turn out
to be drawing energy

00:03:43.148 --> 00:03:46.177
from some external source.

00:03:46.177 --> 00:03:48.707
Even if engineers could 
somehow design a machine

00:03:48.707 --> 00:03:51.618
that didn't violate the first law
of thermodynamics,

00:03:51.618 --> 00:03:56.387
it still wouldn't work in the real world
because of the second law.

00:03:56.387 --> 00:03:58.118
The second law of thermodynamics

00:03:58.118 --> 00:04:03.345
tells us that energy tends to spread out
through processes like friction.

00:04:03.345 --> 00:04:05.677
Any real machine would have moving parts

00:04:05.677 --> 00:04:08.562
or interactions with air 
or liquid molecules

00:04:08.562 --> 00:04:12.348
that would generate tiny amounts
of friction and heat,

00:04:12.348 --> 00:04:14.635
even in a vacuum.

00:04:14.635 --> 00:04:16.998
That heat is energy escaping,

00:04:16.998 --> 00:04:18.561
and it would keep leeching out,

00:04:18.561 --> 00:04:21.488
reducing the energy available
to move the system itself

00:04:21.488 --> 00:04:25.248
until the machine inevitably stopped.

00:04:25.248 --> 00:04:27.769
So far, these two laws of thermodynamics

00:04:27.769 --> 00:04:31.299
have stymied every idea 
for perpetual motion

00:04:31.299 --> 00:04:36.639
and the dreams of perfectly efficient
energy generation they imply.

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.748
Yet it's hard to conclusively say we'll
never discover a perpetual motion machine

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:46.550
because there's still so much we don't
understand about the universe.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.313
Perhaps we'll find 
new exotic forms of matter

00:04:49.313 --> 00:04:53.340
that'll force us to revisit the laws
of thermodynamics.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.600
Or maybe there's perpetual motion
on tiny quantum scales.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.730
What we can be reasonably sure about
is that we'll never stop looking.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.211
For now, the one thing that seems
truly perpetual is our search.
