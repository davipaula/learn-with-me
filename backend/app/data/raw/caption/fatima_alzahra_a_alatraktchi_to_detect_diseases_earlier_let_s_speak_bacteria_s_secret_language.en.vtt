00:00:13.992 --> 00:00:15.317
You don't know them.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.436
You don't see them.

00:00:18.405 --> 00:00:20.408
But they're always around,

00:00:21.404 --> 00:00:23.084
whispering,

00:00:23.108 --> 00:00:24.922
making secret plans,

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.382
building armies with millions of soldiers.

00:00:30.826 --> 00:00:32.617
And when they decide to attack,

00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:35.697
they all attack at the same time.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.909
I'm talking about bacteria.

00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:42.258
(Laughter)

00:00:42.282 --> 00:00:44.137
Who did you think I was talking about?

00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:49.595
Bacteria live in communities
just like humans.

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:50.892
They have families,

00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:52.067
they talk,

00:00:52.091 --> 00:00:53.933
and they plan their activities.

00:00:53.957 --> 00:00:56.614
And just like humans, they trick, deceive,

00:00:56.638 --> 00:00:58.772
and some might even cheat on each other.

00:01:00.127 --> 00:01:03.974
What if I tell you that we can listen
to bacterial conversations

00:01:03.998 --> 00:01:07.572
and translate their confidential
information into human language?

00:01:08.255 --> 00:01:13.053
And what if I tell you that translating
bacterial conversations can save lives?

00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:16.290
I hold a PhD in nanophysics,

00:01:16.314 --> 00:01:20.690
and I've used nanotechnology
to develop a real-time translation tool

00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:23.033
that can spy on bacterial communities

00:01:23.057 --> 00:01:25.973
and give us recordings
of what bacteria are up to.

00:01:28.123 --> 00:01:29.719
Bacteria live everywhere.

00:01:29.743 --> 00:01:32.072
They're in the soil, on our furniture

00:01:32.096 --> 00:01:33.407
and inside our bodies.

00:01:34.083 --> 00:01:38.622
In fact, 90 percent of all the live cells
in this theater are bacterial.

00:01:39.915 --> 00:01:41.514
Some bacteria are good for us;

00:01:41.538 --> 00:01:44.750
they help us digest food
or produce antibiotics.

00:01:44.774 --> 00:01:46.866
And some bacteria are bad for us;

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.784
they cause diseases and death.

00:01:49.794 --> 00:01:52.210
To coordinate all
the functions bacteria have,

00:01:52.234 --> 00:01:54.306
they have to be able to organize,

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.371
and they do that just like us humans --

00:01:56.395 --> 00:01:57.554
by communicating.

00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:00.226
But instead of using words,

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.192
they use signaling molecules
to communicate with each other.

00:02:04.083 --> 00:02:05.340
When bacteria are few,

00:02:05.364 --> 00:02:08.107
the signaling molecules just flow away,

00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:10.636
like the screams of a man
alone in the desert.

00:02:11.518 --> 00:02:15.510
But when there are many bacteria,
the signaling molecules accumulate,

00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:18.526
and the bacteria start sensing
that they're not alone.

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:20.643
They listen to each other.

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.275
In this way, they keep track
of how many they are

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.620
and when they're many enough
to initiate a new action.

00:02:28.575 --> 00:02:32.432
And when the signaling molecules
have reached a certain threshold,

00:02:32.456 --> 00:02:35.577
all the bacteria sense at once
that they need to act

00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:36.919
with the same action.

00:02:37.967 --> 00:02:42.293
So bacterial conversation consists
of an initiative and a reaction,

00:02:42.317 --> 00:02:45.389
a production of a molecule
and the response to it.

00:02:47.094 --> 00:02:50.434
In my research, I focused on spying
on bacterial communities

00:02:50.458 --> 00:02:51.861
inside the human body.

00:02:52.343 --> 00:02:53.588
How does it work?

00:02:54.385 --> 00:02:56.300
We have a sample from a patient.

00:02:56.324 --> 00:02:58.862
It could be a blood or spit sample.

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:01.841
We shoot electrons into the sample,

00:03:01.865 --> 00:03:05.785
the electrons will interact with any
communication molecules present,

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:08.190
and this interaction
will give us information

00:03:08.214 --> 00:03:10.105
on the identity of the bacteria,

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.800
the type of communication

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:14.117
and how much the bacteria are talking.

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.590
But what is it like
when bacteria communicate?

00:03:19.747 --> 00:03:23.507
Before I developed the translation tool,

00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:27.377
my first assumption was that bacteria
would have a primitive language,

00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:30.579
like infants that haven't developed
words and sentences yet.

00:03:31.208 --> 00:03:34.129
When they laugh, they're happy;
when they cry, they're sad.

00:03:34.153 --> 00:03:35.303
Simple as that.

00:03:36.008 --> 00:03:40.123
But bacteria turned out to be nowhere
as primitive as I thought they would be.

00:03:40.615 --> 00:03:42.855
A molecule is not just a molecule.

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.633
It can mean different things
depending on the context,

00:03:46.404 --> 00:03:49.346
just like the crying of babies
can mean different things:

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.140
sometimes the baby is hungry,

00:03:51.164 --> 00:03:52.358
sometimes it's wet,

00:03:52.382 --> 00:03:54.401
sometimes it's hurt or afraid.

00:03:54.425 --> 00:03:56.775
Parents know how to decode those cries.

00:03:57.624 --> 00:03:59.506
And to be a real translation tool,

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.503
it had to be able to decode
the signaling molecules

00:04:02.527 --> 00:04:06.588
and translate them
depending on the context.

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:08.648
And who knows?

00:04:08.672 --> 00:04:10.833
Maybe Google Translate
will adopt this soon.

00:04:10.857 --> 00:04:13.226
(Laughter)

00:04:14.386 --> 00:04:16.104
Let me give you an example.

00:04:16.128 --> 00:04:19.717
I've brought some bacterial data
that can be a bit tricky to understand

00:04:19.741 --> 00:04:20.892
if you're not trained,

00:04:20.916 --> 00:04:22.261
but try to take a look.

00:04:23.548 --> 00:04:25.467
(Laughter)

00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:30.436
Here's a happy bacterial family
that has infected a patient.

00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:34.294
Let's call them the Montague family.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.381
They share resources,
they reproduce, and they grow.

00:04:40.294 --> 00:04:42.273
One day, they get a new neighbor,

00:04:44.746 --> 00:04:46.513
bacterial family Capulet.

00:04:46.537 --> 00:04:47.687
(Laughter)

00:04:48.157 --> 00:04:50.947
Everything is fine,
as long as they're working together.

00:04:52.377 --> 00:04:55.383
But then something unplanned happens.

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:00.667
Romeo from Montague has a relationship
with Juliet from Capulet.

00:05:00.691 --> 00:05:01.841
(Laughter)

00:05:02.978 --> 00:05:05.873
And yes, they share genetic material.

00:05:05.897 --> 00:05:08.006
(Laughter)

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.381
Now, this gene transfer
can be dangerous to the Montagues

00:05:13.405 --> 00:05:17.471
that have the ambition to be the only
family in the patient they have infected,

00:05:17.495 --> 00:05:18.919
and sharing genes contributes

00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:21.777
to the Capulets developing
resistance to antibiotics.

00:05:23.747 --> 00:05:28.392
So the Montagues start talking internally
to get rid of this other family

00:05:28.416 --> 00:05:30.138
by releasing this molecule.

00:05:30.688 --> 00:05:31.838
(Laughter)

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.062
And with subtitles:

00:05:34.372 --> 00:05:35.978
[Let us coordinate an attack.]

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:37.293
(Laughter)

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:39.430
Let's coordinate an attack.

00:05:41.148 --> 00:05:44.248
And then everybody at once responds

00:05:44.272 --> 00:05:48.595
by releasing a poison
that will kill the other family.

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:50.387
[Eliminate!]

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:54.261
(Laughter)

00:05:55.338 --> 00:05:59.731
The Capulets respond
by calling for a counterattack.

00:05:59.755 --> 00:06:00.911
[Counterattack!]

00:06:00.935 --> 00:06:02.360
And they have a battle.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.708
This is a video of real bacteria
dueling with swordlike organelles,

00:06:08.732 --> 00:06:10.345
where they try to kill each other

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:13.207
by literally stabbing
and rupturing each other.

00:06:14.784 --> 00:06:18.745
Whoever's family wins this battle
becomes the dominant bacteria.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.639
So what I can do is to detect
bacterial conversations

00:06:23.663 --> 00:06:25.695
that lead to different
collective behaviors

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:27.154
like the fight you just saw.

00:06:27.633 --> 00:06:30.550
And what I did was to spy
on bacterial communities

00:06:30.574 --> 00:06:32.617
inside the human body

00:06:32.641 --> 00:06:34.357
in patients at a hospital.

00:06:34.737 --> 00:06:37.207
I followed 62 patients in an experiment,

00:06:37.231 --> 00:06:40.979
where I tested the patient samples
for one particular infection,

00:06:41.003 --> 00:06:44.332
without knowing the results
of the traditional diagnostic test.

00:06:44.356 --> 00:06:48.576
Now, in bacterial diagnostics,

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.581
a sample is smeared out on a plate,

00:06:50.605 --> 00:06:53.729
and if the bacteria grow within five days,

00:06:53.753 --> 00:06:56.117
the patient is diagnosed as infected.

00:06:57.842 --> 00:07:00.661
When I finished the study
and I compared the tool results

00:07:00.685 --> 00:07:03.923
to the traditional diagnostic test
and the validation test,

00:07:03.947 --> 00:07:05.347
I was shocked.

00:07:05.371 --> 00:07:09.082
It was far more astonishing
than I had ever anticipated.

00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:12.150
But before I tell you
what the tool revealed,

00:07:12.174 --> 00:07:15.168
I would like to tell you about
a specific patient I followed,

00:07:15.192 --> 00:07:16.359
a young girl.

00:07:16.803 --> 00:07:18.253
She had cystic fibrosis,

00:07:18.277 --> 00:07:22.017
a genetic disease that made her lungs
susceptible to bacterial infections.

00:07:22.837 --> 00:07:25.233
This girl wasn't a part
of the clinical trial.

00:07:25.257 --> 00:07:28.084
I followed her because I knew
from her medical record

00:07:28.108 --> 00:07:30.208
that she had never had
an infection before.

00:07:31.453 --> 00:07:33.558
Once a month, this girl
went to the hospital

00:07:33.582 --> 00:07:36.236
to cough up a sputum sample
that she spit in a cup.

00:07:36.916 --> 00:07:40.042
This sample was transferred
for bacterial analysis

00:07:40.066 --> 00:07:41.996
at the central laboratory

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.486
so the doctors could act quickly
if they discovered an infection.

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:48.973
And it allowed me to test my device
on her samples as well.

00:07:49.355 --> 00:07:52.767
The first two months I measured
on her samples, there was nothing.

00:07:53.794 --> 00:07:54.961
But the third month,

00:07:54.985 --> 00:07:57.641
I discovered some bacterial
chatter in her sample.

00:07:58.473 --> 00:08:01.585
The bacteria were coordinating
to damage her lung tissue.

00:08:02.534 --> 00:08:06.545
But the traditional diagnostics
showed no bacteria at all.

00:08:07.711 --> 00:08:09.630
I measured again the next month,

00:08:09.654 --> 00:08:13.282
and I could see that the bacterial
conversations became even more aggressive.

00:08:14.167 --> 00:08:16.919
Still, the traditional
diagnostics showed nothing.

00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:22.100
My study ended, but a half a year later,
I followed up on her status

00:08:22.124 --> 00:08:25.365
to see if the bacteria
only I knew about had disappeared

00:08:25.389 --> 00:08:27.404
without medical intervention.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:29.500
They hadn't.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.853
But the girl was now diagnosed
with a severe infection

00:08:32.877 --> 00:08:34.195
of deadly bacteria.

00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:39.589
It was the very same bacteria
my tool discovered earlier.

00:08:40.537 --> 00:08:43.033
And despite aggressive
antibiotic treatment,

00:08:43.057 --> 00:08:45.586
it was impossible
to eradicate the infection.

00:08:46.816 --> 00:08:49.898
Doctors deemed that she would not
survive her 20s.

00:08:52.404 --> 00:08:54.509
When I measured on this girl's samples,

00:08:54.533 --> 00:08:56.732
my tool was still in the initial stage.

00:08:56.756 --> 00:08:59.455
I didn't even know
if my method worked at all,

00:08:59.479 --> 00:09:01.626
therefore I had an agreement
with the doctors

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:03.511
not to tell them what my tool revealed

00:09:03.535 --> 00:09:05.675
in order not to compromise
their treatment.

00:09:06.111 --> 00:09:08.914
So when I saw these results
that weren't even validated,

00:09:08.938 --> 00:09:10.290
I didn't dare to tell

00:09:10.314 --> 00:09:13.121
because treating a patient
without an actual infection

00:09:13.145 --> 00:09:15.755
also has negative
consequences for the patient.

00:09:17.092 --> 00:09:18.714
But now we know better,

00:09:18.738 --> 00:09:22.137
and there are many young boys
and girls that still can be saved

00:09:23.172 --> 00:09:26.596
because, unfortunately,
this scenario happens very often.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.163
Patients get infected,

00:09:28.187 --> 00:09:31.664
the bacteria somehow don't show
on the traditional diagnostic test,

00:09:31.688 --> 00:09:35.540
and suddenly, the infection breaks out
in the patient with severe symptoms.

00:09:35.564 --> 00:09:37.722
And at that point, it's already too late.

00:09:39.219 --> 00:09:42.773
The surprising result
of the 62 patients I followed

00:09:42.797 --> 00:09:45.340
was that my device
caught bacterial conversations

00:09:45.364 --> 00:09:47.580
in more than half of the patient samples

00:09:47.604 --> 00:09:50.535
that were diagnosed as negative
by traditional methods.

00:09:51.501 --> 00:09:55.055
In other words, more than half
of these patients went home thinking

00:09:55.079 --> 00:09:56.764
they were free from infection,

00:09:56.788 --> 00:09:59.536
although they actually carried
dangerous bacteria.

00:10:01.257 --> 00:10:03.554
Inside these wrongly diagnosed patients,

00:10:03.578 --> 00:10:06.598
bacteria were coordinating
a synchronized attack.

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.218
They were whispering to each other.

00:10:09.892 --> 00:10:11.523
What I call "whispering bacteria"

00:10:11.547 --> 00:10:14.551
are bacteria that traditional
methods cannot diagnose.

00:10:15.383 --> 00:10:19.326
So far, it's only the translation tool
that can catch those whispers.

00:10:20.364 --> 00:10:23.767
I believe that the time frame
in which bacteria are still whispering

00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:26.778
is a window of opportunity
for targeted treatment.

00:10:27.608 --> 00:10:30.741
If the girl had been treated
during this window of opportunity,

00:10:30.765 --> 00:10:33.266
it might have been possible
to kill the bacteria

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:34.755
in their initial stage,

00:10:34.779 --> 00:10:36.885
before the infection got out of hand.

00:10:39.131 --> 00:10:43.102
What I experienced with this young girl
made me decide to do everything I can

00:10:43.126 --> 00:10:45.331
to push this technology into the hospital.

00:10:46.212 --> 00:10:47.363
Together with doctors,

00:10:47.387 --> 00:10:50.356
I'm already working
on implementing this tool in clinics

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.202
to diagnose early infections.

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:56.563
Although it's still not known
how doctors should treat patients

00:10:56.587 --> 00:10:58.400
during the whispering phase,

00:10:58.424 --> 00:11:02.127
this tool can help doctors
keep a closer eye on patients in risk.

00:11:02.548 --> 00:11:05.830
It could help them confirm
if a treatment had worked or not,

00:11:05.854 --> 00:11:08.618
and it could help answer simple questions:

00:11:08.642 --> 00:11:10.372
Is the patient infected?

00:11:10.396 --> 00:11:12.206
And what are the bacteria up to?

00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.745
Bacteria talk,

00:11:14.769 --> 00:11:16.795
they make secret plans,

00:11:16.819 --> 00:11:19.642
and they send confidential
information to each other.

00:11:20.253 --> 00:11:22.932
But not only can we catch them whispering,

00:11:22.956 --> 00:11:25.423
we can all learn their secret language

00:11:25.447 --> 00:11:28.326
and become ourselves bacterial whisperers.

00:11:28.973 --> 00:11:30.687
And, as bacteria would say,

00:11:31.656 --> 00:11:34.754
"3-oxo-C12-aniline."

00:11:35.763 --> 00:11:36.931
(Laughter)

00:11:36.955 --> 00:11:38.040
(Applause)

00:11:38.064 --> 00:11:39.248
Thank you.
