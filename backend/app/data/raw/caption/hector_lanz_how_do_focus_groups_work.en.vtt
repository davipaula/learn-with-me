00:00:07.148 --> 00:00:10.927
Why do we buy certain products
or choose certain brands?

00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:14.528
This is the sort of question advertisers
have always asked,

00:00:14.528 --> 00:00:16.478
and there are no easy answers.

00:00:16.478 --> 00:00:20.528
However, there is a handy tool
that helps companies explore this

00:00:20.528 --> 00:00:22.559
and similar questions,

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:25.147
and it's called the focus group.

00:00:25.147 --> 00:00:29.055
Until the 1940s, market research
was often quantitative

00:00:29.055 --> 00:00:34.318
using things like sales figures
and customer polls to track consumption.

00:00:34.318 --> 00:00:36.921
But this changed during World War II.

00:00:36.921 --> 00:00:40.751
Sociologists Robert Merton
and Paul Lazarsfeld

00:00:40.751 --> 00:00:45.118
set out to learn how unprecedented
exposure to wartime propaganda

00:00:45.118 --> 00:00:47.269
was affecting the public.

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:49.640
Instead of polling large numbers of people

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.890
with straightforward questions
and quantifiable answers,

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.127
the researchers conducted 
in-person interviews,

00:00:56.127 --> 00:00:58.155
sometimes with small groups,

00:00:58.155 --> 00:01:00.834
engaging them in more open discussions.

00:01:00.834 --> 00:01:04.283
Later, this method was picked up
by the advertising industry

00:01:04.283 --> 00:01:05.830
with the help of consultants,

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.660
like Austrian-born psychologist
Ernest Dichter,

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.171
who first coined the term focus group.

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:15.402
This new technique was a type
of qualitative research

00:01:15.402 --> 00:01:19.610
focused on the nature 
of people's preferences and thoughts.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.452
It couldn't tell marketers what percentage
of people buy a certain product or brand,

00:01:24.452 --> 00:01:27.300
but it could tell them more about
the people who do,

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.120
their reasoning for doing so,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.290
and even the unconscious motivations
behind those reasons.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.791
Rather than providing definite conclusions
for business and sales,

00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:40.692
focus groups would be used
for exploratory research,

00:01:40.692 --> 00:01:42.831
generating new ideas for products

00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:47.241
and marketing based on deeper
understanding of consumer habits.

00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:52.442
For example, early focus groups found that
contrary to popular opinion at the time,

00:01:52.442 --> 00:01:57.702
wives often had more influence than their
husbands when choosing which car to buy,

00:01:57.702 --> 00:02:02.382
so Chrysler shifted gears by marketing
cars directly to women.

00:02:02.382 --> 00:02:05.981
And Dr. Dichter himself conducted
focus groups for Mattel

00:02:05.981 --> 00:02:09.021
to learn what girls wanted in a doll.

00:02:09.021 --> 00:02:12.072
The result was the original Barbie doll.

00:02:12.072 --> 00:02:14.472
So how does a focus group work?

00:02:14.472 --> 00:02:18.183
First, companies recruit between
six and ten participants

00:02:18.183 --> 00:02:23.013
according to specific criteria
that meet their research objectives.

00:02:23.013 --> 00:02:26.022
They could be mothers of children
between five and seven,

00:02:26.022 --> 00:02:30.756
or teenagers planning to buy
a new phone in the next three months.

00:02:30.756 --> 00:02:34.744
This is often done through professional
recruiters who manage lists of people

00:02:34.744 --> 00:02:39.235
who've agreed to participate in
focus groups for payment or other rewards.

00:02:39.235 --> 00:02:43.763
During a session, participants are asked
to respond to various prompts

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:45.554
from the group moderator,

00:02:45.554 --> 00:02:47.974
like sharing their opinions
on a certain product,

00:02:47.974 --> 00:02:51.644
or their emotional reactions
to an advertisement.

00:02:51.644 --> 00:02:55.425
They may even be asked to do
seemingly unrelated tasks,

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:58.594
like imagining brands as animals in a zoo.

00:02:58.594 --> 00:03:01.643
The idea is that this can reveal 
useful information

00:03:01.643 --> 00:03:03.475
about the participant's feelings

00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:07.085
that traditional questions 
might not get to.

00:03:07.085 --> 00:03:10.674
Beyond these basics,
many variations are possible.

00:03:10.674 --> 00:03:13.595
A focus group may have two
or more moderators

00:03:13.595 --> 00:03:16.645
perhaps taking opposite sides
on a question,

00:03:16.645 --> 00:03:20.304
or a researcher might be hidden
in the focus group

00:03:20.304 --> 00:03:24.685
unknown to other participants to see
how their answers can be influenced.

00:03:24.685 --> 00:03:28.087
And the whole process may also
be observed by researchers

00:03:28.087 --> 00:03:30.625
through a one-way mirror.

00:03:30.625 --> 00:03:32.936
But although they can provide
valuable insight,

00:03:32.936 --> 00:03:35.587
focus groups do have their limitations,

00:03:35.587 --> 00:03:39.436
and one of the main ones is that
the simple act of observing something

00:03:39.436 --> 00:03:40.895
can change it.

00:03:40.895 --> 00:03:43.687
This principle is called 
observer interference.

00:03:43.687 --> 00:03:45.617
The answers participants give

00:03:45.617 --> 00:03:49.395
are likely to be affected 
by the presence of the researchers,

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:51.496
social pressure 
from the rest of the group,

00:03:51.496 --> 00:03:55.135
or simply knowing that they're taking
part in a focus group.

00:03:55.135 --> 00:03:59.696
And because researchers often use
a small sample size in a specific setting,

00:03:59.696 --> 00:04:02.547
it's hard to generalize their results.

00:04:02.547 --> 00:04:05.447
The findings that researchers do reach
from focus groups

00:04:05.447 --> 00:04:09.097
are often tested through experiments
and data gathering.

00:04:09.097 --> 00:04:13.558
Those put numbers on questions like
how many potential customers there are

00:04:13.558 --> 00:04:16.217
and what price they'd be willing to pay.

00:04:16.217 --> 00:04:20.187
This part of the process changes
as technology evolves.

00:04:20.187 --> 00:04:23.637
But focus groups have remained
largely the same for decades.

00:04:23.637 --> 00:04:26.977
Perhaps when it comes
to the big, important questions,

00:04:26.977 --> 00:04:31.458
there's no substitute for people
genuinely interacting with each other.
