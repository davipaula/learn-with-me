00:00:12.377 --> 00:00:15.415
Every year, more than four
to five million people die

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:18.716
due to exposure to outdoor air pollution

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:19.890
around the world.

00:00:20.435 --> 00:00:22.774
This petri dish that you are looking at

00:00:23.302 --> 00:00:26.903
contains approximately
20 minutes' worth of pollution

00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:28.993
captured off a pyrolysis plant.

00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:31.616
This is PM 2.5.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.806
These particles --
you can see it right now,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.655
but when they're out there
in the air, you won't see them.

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:38.648
These are so tiny that our lungs --

00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:42.998
our bodies cannot filter them,
and they end up in our bodies --

00:00:43.022 --> 00:00:46.666
give us asthma and lung cancer
if not treated in the right time.

00:00:47.077 --> 00:00:50.441
On a trip back to India,
when I was a student in 2012,

00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:51.681
I took this picture.

00:00:51.963 --> 00:00:53.552
This picture stuck in my head.

00:00:53.938 --> 00:00:57.700
On one side, you see this exhaust
of a diesel generator,

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:00.339
the same generator
which is a sign of human progress,

00:01:00.363 --> 00:01:03.231
which is a sign of rapid industrialization

00:01:03.255 --> 00:01:06.505
and what we have become
as a society in the last 100 years,

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:07.691
generating energy.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.232
But on the other side,

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:12.952
you see this very interesting
triangular, black-colored swatch,

00:01:12.976 --> 00:01:16.170
that is produced by the same
residual particulate waste

00:01:16.194 --> 00:01:19.105
created by the emissions of the generator.

00:01:20.078 --> 00:01:22.165
Now, this picture gave me an idea

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.062
and got me thinking about rethinking
both pollution and inks,

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:29.237
because it was making
that black-colored mark.

00:01:29.262 --> 00:01:33.085
Now, the reality is that most of the black
ink that we use conventionally

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.433
is traditionally produced

00:01:34.457 --> 00:01:38.346
by conventionally burning
fossil fuels in factories.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.554
There are factories around the world
that are burning fossil fuels

00:01:41.578 --> 00:01:42.829
to produce carbon black,

00:01:43.089 --> 00:01:45.629
to make black inks that we use
on an everyday basis.

00:01:46.346 --> 00:01:49.323
But given that millions
of liters of fossil fuels

00:01:49.347 --> 00:01:51.354
are already being burned out there

00:01:51.378 --> 00:01:54.846
by our cars, our engines
and our exhaust out there,

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.329
what if you could capture that pollution

00:01:57.353 --> 00:02:00.105
and use it to recycle and make those inks?

00:02:00.623 --> 00:02:02.623
I decided to give this experiment a shot.

00:02:03.544 --> 00:02:07.520
I went back to my lab back in Boston
and conducted a small experiment.

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:10.124
In Boston, I couldn't find
much pollution to play with,

00:02:10.148 --> 00:02:11.742
so I resorted to using a candle.

00:02:12.782 --> 00:02:14.624
This was an experiment.

00:02:14.648 --> 00:02:15.958
I burnt a candle,

00:02:15.982 --> 00:02:19.259
built this contraption
that would suck in that candle soot,

00:02:19.283 --> 00:02:21.450
mixed it with some
vegetable oil and vodka,

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:25.163
because to a DIY hacker,
these were really easily available.

00:02:25.188 --> 00:02:26.229
(Laughter)

00:02:26.254 --> 00:02:27.538
And after mixing them,

00:02:27.562 --> 00:02:30.498
you could churn out
a very rudimentary form of ink

00:02:30.522 --> 00:02:32.285
that would go into a cartridge,

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:34.568
and now you could print with it.

00:02:34.592 --> 00:02:37.655
This was my "Hello, World!"
of experimenting

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:39.300
with printing with pollution.

00:02:41.162 --> 00:02:44.138
This is the same pollution
that I showed you in the petri dish,

00:02:44.162 --> 00:02:47.520
which is the result of any fossil fuel
that is being burned out there.

00:02:49.005 --> 00:02:52.471
In 2015, I decided to take
this experimentation forward

00:02:52.495 --> 00:02:54.234
and set up a lab in India

00:02:54.258 --> 00:02:56.785
to work on the capture and recycling
of air pollution.

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:00.092
In the good times, the lab
used to look something like this.

00:03:00.116 --> 00:03:02.885
But experimentations
were not always controlled,

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.195
and disasters happened.

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:06.459
And while experimentation would happen,

00:03:06.483 --> 00:03:08.866
the lab would end up
looking something like this.

00:03:09.234 --> 00:03:11.878
Well, we knew where we wanted to go,

00:03:11.902 --> 00:03:14.296
but we were not sure
how exactly to reach there.

00:03:14.568 --> 00:03:17.584
The passersby who used to go
by that lab through that building

00:03:17.608 --> 00:03:20.756
used to, at times, think,
"These guys are making bombs in there,"

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.104
because there was too much fire,
wires and smoke in the same vicinity.

00:03:25.128 --> 00:03:26.278
(Laughter)

00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:30.027
We decided, let's move to a garage
and take experiments forward.

00:03:30.051 --> 00:03:32.281
We took a garage,
and during the early stages,

00:03:32.305 --> 00:03:35.684
we were driving around Bangalore
with contraptions like these.

00:03:35.708 --> 00:03:37.302
This is an early-stage prototype.

00:03:37.326 --> 00:03:38.928
Imagine the looks people gave us,

00:03:38.952 --> 00:03:40.983
"What are these cars
driving around doing?"

00:03:41.007 --> 00:03:44.622
This is an early-stage prototype
of our system that would capture pollution

00:03:44.646 --> 00:03:48.591
that is being released from
a conventional diesel-based car.

00:03:48.615 --> 00:03:50.624
This is an early stage of the technology.

00:03:50.648 --> 00:03:55.465
We advanced the technology
and created this into this version

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.418
that would capture pollution
from static sources of pollution,

00:03:58.442 --> 00:03:59.605
like a diesel generator.

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.782
If you see, all the fumes disappear
as soon as you turn this machine on.

00:04:04.838 --> 00:04:08.440
Without affecting
the performance of the engine,

00:04:08.464 --> 00:04:11.960
we are able to capture
95 percent worth of pollution

00:04:11.984 --> 00:04:13.957
released from the diesel generator.

00:04:13.981 --> 00:04:17.751
This is the particulate matter
that we are talking about that we capture,

00:04:17.775 --> 00:04:21.598
in this case, within three to four hours
of operation of a generator.

00:04:22.838 --> 00:04:26.600
And while our experiments
and our research was advancing,

00:04:26.624 --> 00:04:29.893
a very big company, a very big brand,
approached us and said,

00:04:29.917 --> 00:04:32.655
"We want to take this idea
further with you guys,

00:04:32.679 --> 00:04:35.998
and take this further
in a very big celebrated form."

00:04:36.022 --> 00:04:38.347
They said, "Let's do a global art campaign

00:04:38.371 --> 00:04:41.173
with the inks that you are making
off this pollution."

00:04:41.546 --> 00:04:43.840
I'll show you what the ink looks like.

00:04:43.864 --> 00:04:49.790
So, this pen is made by recycling
40 to 50 minutes of that car pollution

00:04:49.814 --> 00:04:51.082
that we are talking about,

00:04:51.106 --> 00:04:53.203
the same pollution
that is in the petri dish.

00:04:53.227 --> 00:04:55.687
And it's a very sharp black
that you can write with.

00:04:55.711 --> 00:04:57.378
So I'm going to write ...

00:05:00.822 --> 00:05:03.515
PM 2.5, that's incorrect.

00:05:03.925 --> 00:05:07.827
So this is a very sharp black
that is generated by the same pollution.

00:05:08.647 --> 00:05:10.711
After much work on the lab-level research,

00:05:10.735 --> 00:05:14.846
we got an offer from a big corporation
to do a very big trial of this idea.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.672
And it happened to be a brand,
and we didn't think twice.

00:05:17.696 --> 00:05:19.418
We said, "Let's go ahead."

00:05:19.442 --> 00:05:21.822
Inventing in the lab is one thing

00:05:21.846 --> 00:05:25.751
and taking ideas and deploying them
in the real world is completely another.

00:05:26.188 --> 00:05:27.655
During early stages,

00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:31.658
we had to resort to using
our own houses and own kitchens

00:05:31.682 --> 00:05:33.576
as our ink-making factories,

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.402
and our own bedrooms and living rooms

00:05:35.426 --> 00:05:38.305
as the first assembly line
for making these inks.

00:05:38.735 --> 00:05:41.402
This is my cofounder Nikhil's own bedroom,

00:05:41.426 --> 00:05:45.314
that is being used to supply inks
to artists all around the world,

00:05:45.338 --> 00:05:46.743
who would paint with AIR-INK.

00:05:46.767 --> 00:05:49.282
And that's him, delivering
AIR-INKs to the ports

00:05:49.306 --> 00:05:51.759
so that the artists
around the world can use it.

00:05:52.441 --> 00:05:53.627
Soon, we started seeing

00:05:53.651 --> 00:05:56.799
that thousands of artists around the world
started using AIR-INK,

00:05:56.823 --> 00:05:58.884
and artworks started emerging like this.

00:05:59.632 --> 00:06:02.442
Soon, thousands of black-and-white,
pollution-made artworks

00:06:02.466 --> 00:06:04.314
started emerging on a global scale.

00:06:04.338 --> 00:06:08.147
And believe me, for a group
of scientists and engineers and inventors,

00:06:08.171 --> 00:06:11.427
there was nothing more satisfying
than that the product of their work

00:06:11.451 --> 00:06:14.716
is now being used by some
of the finest artists around the world.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.479
This is the cover of "Contagious"
magazine last year,

00:06:17.503 --> 00:06:21.382
that was done by using the same ink
that we made back in our labs.

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:25.959
This is a famous painting
by the British artist, Christian Furr,

00:06:25.983 --> 00:06:29.790
who painted it for the song
"Paint It Black" by The Rolling Stones.

00:06:30.394 --> 00:06:33.457
Now, there's more to this pen and this ink

00:06:33.481 --> 00:06:36.862
than just the popular
and pop-culture artworks.

00:06:36.886 --> 00:06:38.958
And now our goal is to create a company

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:42.021
that can actually make some black money --
I mean, just money --

00:06:42.045 --> 00:06:43.116
(Laughter)

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.854
and high-quality printing
processes and inks

00:06:45.878 --> 00:06:48.738
that can replace
the conventional black inks

00:06:48.762 --> 00:06:52.659
that have been produced for the last
thousands of years around the world.

00:06:52.683 --> 00:06:56.516
Soon after our growing popularity
and artworks around the world,

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.270
we started facing a very different
kind of a problem.

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:01.993
We started getting spammed by polluters,

00:07:02.017 --> 00:07:05.949
who would send us bags full of pollution
to our office address,

00:07:05.973 --> 00:07:08.488
asking us, "What can we do
with this pollution?"

00:07:08.512 --> 00:07:11.317
Our lab back in Bombay right now
has pollution samples

00:07:11.341 --> 00:07:15.617
that have come from London,
from India, from China, you name it.

00:07:15.641 --> 00:07:17.388
And this is just the beginning.

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:21.721
This polluter sent us
this specific image, asking us

00:07:21.745 --> 00:07:24.464
that these are all bags
filled with PM 2.5,

00:07:24.488 --> 00:07:27.931
and can we recycle it for him
if we paid him some money.

00:07:28.378 --> 00:07:31.981
Well, what would he have done
if we did not take that pollution?

00:07:32.005 --> 00:07:35.730
He would probably find a nearby river
or a landfill and dump it over there.

00:07:36.036 --> 00:07:39.862
But now, because we had the economics
of AIR-INK figured out on the other side,

00:07:39.886 --> 00:07:45.068
we could incentivize him to give us
this pollution and make inks from it,

00:07:45.092 --> 00:07:48.159
and turn it into even
more valuable products.

00:07:49.059 --> 00:07:52.090
Now, pollution, as we all know,
is a global killer.

00:07:52.616 --> 00:07:56.005
We can't claim that our ink
will solve the world's pollution problem.

00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:57.735
But it does show what can be done

00:07:57.759 --> 00:08:00.402
if you look at this problem
slightly differently.

00:08:00.765 --> 00:08:03.316
Look at this T-shirt
I'm holding right now.

00:08:04.052 --> 00:08:07.738
This is made from the same
AIR-INK I'm talking about.

00:08:08.068 --> 00:08:11.259
It's made from the same pollution
that is inside this petri dish.

00:08:11.283 --> 00:08:15.507
And the same pollution we are all
breathing in when we are walking outdoors.

00:08:15.531 --> 00:08:17.760
And we are on our way
to do better than this.

00:08:17.784 --> 00:08:19.118
Thank you very much.

00:08:19.142 --> 00:08:22.443
(Applause)
