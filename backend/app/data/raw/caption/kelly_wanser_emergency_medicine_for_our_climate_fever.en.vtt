00:00:12.844 --> 00:00:16.744
I'm here to talk to you about something
important that may be new to you.

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:18.645
The governments of the world

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:20.933
are about to conduct
an unintentional experiment

00:00:20.957 --> 00:00:22.712
on our climate.

00:00:22.736 --> 00:00:28.046
In 2020, new rules will require ships
to lower their sulfur emissions

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.178
by scrubbing their dirty exhaust

00:00:30.202 --> 00:00:32.153
or switching to cleaner fuels.

00:00:32.705 --> 00:00:35.338
For human health, this is really good,

00:00:35.362 --> 00:00:37.696
but sulfur particles
in the emission of ships

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.481
also have an effect on clouds.

00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:43.482
This is a satellite image of marine clouds

00:00:43.506 --> 00:00:46.028
off the Pacific West Coast
of the United States.

00:00:46.482 --> 00:00:49.789
The streaks in the clouds
are created by the exhaust from ships.

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:53.013
Ships' emissions include
both greenhouse gases,

00:00:53.037 --> 00:00:55.872
which trap heat over long periods of time,

00:00:55.896 --> 00:00:59.111
and particulates like sulfates
that mix with clouds

00:00:59.135 --> 00:01:00.968
and temporarily make them brighter.

00:01:01.672 --> 00:01:04.963
Brighter clouds reflect
more sunlight back to space,

00:01:04.987 --> 00:01:06.276
cooling the climate.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.642
So in fact,

00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.579
humans are currently running
two unintentional experiments

00:01:11.603 --> 00:01:12.753
on our climate.

00:01:13.188 --> 00:01:17.230
In the first one, we're increasing
the concentration of greenhouse gases

00:01:17.254 --> 00:01:19.324
and gradually warming the earth system.

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:23.148
This works something like a fever
in the human body.

00:01:23.172 --> 00:01:26.558
If the fever remains low,
its effects are mild,

00:01:26.582 --> 00:01:29.456
but as the fever rises,
damage grows more severe

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.439
and eventually devastating.

00:01:31.748 --> 00:01:33.629
We're seeing a little of this now.

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:35.962
In our other experiment,

00:01:35.986 --> 00:01:38.606
we're planning to remove
a layer of particles

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.864
that brighten clouds and shield us
from some of this warming.

00:01:42.306 --> 00:01:45.512
The effect is strongest
in ocean clouds like these,

00:01:45.536 --> 00:01:51.005
and scientists expect the reduction
of sulfur emissions from ships next year

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:54.402
to produce a measurable increase
in global warming.

00:01:55.592 --> 00:01:56.742
Bit of a shocker?

00:01:57.687 --> 00:02:01.877
In fact, most emissions contain sulfates
that brighten clouds:

00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:05.467
coal, diesel exhaust, forest fires.

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.848
Scientists estimate that the total
cooling effect from emission particles,

00:02:09.872 --> 00:02:12.700
which they call aerosols
when they're in the climate,

00:02:13.156 --> 00:02:17.724
may be as much as all of the warming
we've experienced up until now.

00:02:17.748 --> 00:02:20.756
There's a lot of uncertainty
around this effect,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.106
and it's one of the major reasons
why we have difficulty predicting climate,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.139
but this is cooling that we'll lose
as emissions fall.

00:02:29.968 --> 00:02:33.944
So to be clear, humans
are currently cooling the planet

00:02:34.896 --> 00:02:38.617
by dispersing particles
into the atmosphere at massive scale.

00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:41.673
We just don't know how much,
and we're doing it accidentally.

00:02:42.585 --> 00:02:44.529
That's worrying,

00:02:44.553 --> 00:02:47.971
but it could mean that we have
a fast-acting way to reduce warming,

00:02:47.995 --> 00:02:51.610
emergency medicine
for our climate fever if we needed it,

00:02:51.634 --> 00:02:54.411
and it's a medicine
with origins in nature.

00:02:56.272 --> 00:02:59.116
This is a NASA simulation
of earth's atmosphere,

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.724
showing clouds and particles
moving over the planet.

00:03:02.454 --> 00:03:06.923
The brightness is the Sun's light
reflecting from particles in clouds,

00:03:06.947 --> 00:03:10.670
and this reflective shield
is one of the primary ways

00:03:10.694 --> 00:03:13.076
that nature keeps the planet
cool enough for humans

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.756
and all of the life that we know.

00:03:15.665 --> 00:03:20.546
In 2015, scientists assessed possibilities
for rapidly cooling climate.

00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:24.236
They discounted
things like mirrors in space,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.101
ping-pong balls in the ocean,
plastic sheets on the Arctic,

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:31.499
and they found
that the most viable approaches

00:03:31.523 --> 00:03:35.590
involved slightly increasing
this atmospheric reflectivity.

00:03:36.406 --> 00:03:40.766
In fact, it's possible that reflecting
just one or two percent more sunlight

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.743
from the atmosphere

00:03:42.767 --> 00:03:46.239
could offset two degrees Celsius
or more of warming.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.235
Now, I'm a technology executive,
not a scientist.

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:54.068
About a decade ago,
concerned about climate,

00:03:54.092 --> 00:03:58.232
I started to talk with scientists about
potential countermeasures to warming.

00:03:58.987 --> 00:04:02.003
These conversations grew
into collaborations

00:04:02.027 --> 00:04:04.351
that became the Marine
Cloud Brightening Project,

00:04:04.375 --> 00:04:06.657
which I'll talk about momentarily,

00:04:06.681 --> 00:04:10.734
and the nonprofit policy organization
SilverLining, where I am today.

00:04:11.483 --> 00:04:15.070
I work with politicians, researchers,

00:04:15.094 --> 00:04:17.070
members of the tech industry and others

00:04:17.094 --> 00:04:19.233
to talk about some of these ideas.

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.284
Early on, I met British
atmospheric scientist John Latham,

00:04:23.308 --> 00:04:26.315
who proposed cooling the climate
the way that the ships do,

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:28.654
but with a natural source of particles:

00:04:28.678 --> 00:04:31.316
sea-salt mist from seawater

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.572
sprayed from ships into areas
of susceptible clouds over the ocean.

00:04:35.366 --> 00:04:38.229
The approach became known
by the name I gave it then,

00:04:38.253 --> 00:04:39.820
"marine cloud brightening."

00:04:39.844 --> 00:04:44.302
Early modeling studies suggested
that by deploying marine cloud brightening

00:04:44.326 --> 00:04:47.914
in just 10 to 20 percent
of susceptible ocean clouds,

00:04:47.938 --> 00:04:52.579
it might be possible to offset
as much as two degrees Celsius's warming.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.129
It might even be possible
to brighten clouds in local regions

00:04:56.153 --> 00:05:00.738
to reduce the impacts caused
by warming ocean surface temperatures.

00:05:00.762 --> 00:05:03.574
For example, regions
such as the Gulf Atlantic

00:05:03.598 --> 00:05:06.218
might be cooled in the months
before a hurricane season

00:05:06.242 --> 00:05:08.583
to reduce the force of storms.

00:05:08.607 --> 00:05:12.530
Or, it might be possible to cool waters
flowing onto coral reefs

00:05:12.554 --> 00:05:14.158
overwhelmed by heat stress,

00:05:14.182 --> 00:05:16.236
like Australia's Great Barrier Reef.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.006
But these ideas are only theoretical,

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.158
and brightening marine clouds
is not the only way

00:05:22.182 --> 00:05:25.483
to increase the reflection
of the sunlight from the atmosphere.

00:05:26.063 --> 00:05:31.016
Another occurs when large volcanoes
release material with enough force

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.245
to reach the upper layer
of the atmosphere, the stratosphere.

00:05:34.705 --> 00:05:37.984
When Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1991,

00:05:38.008 --> 00:05:40.008
it released material
into the stratosphere,

00:05:40.032 --> 00:05:44.494
including sulfates that mix
with the atmosphere to reflect sunlight.

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:48.355
This material remained
and circulated around the planet.

00:05:48.996 --> 00:05:52.968
It was enough to cool the climate
by over half a degree Celsius

00:05:52.992 --> 00:05:54.658
for about two years.

00:05:56.011 --> 00:06:02.027
This cooling led to a striking increase
in Arctic ice cover in 1992,

00:06:02.051 --> 00:06:06.325
which dropped in subsequent years
as the particles fell back to earth.

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:10.167
But the volcanic phenomenon
led Nobel Prize winner Paul Crutzen

00:06:10.191 --> 00:06:13.492
to propose the idea that dispersing
particles into the stratosphere

00:06:13.516 --> 00:06:17.111
in a controlled way might be
a way to counter global warming.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.882
Now, this has risks
that we don't understand,

00:06:20.906 --> 00:06:23.636
including things like
heating up the stratosphere

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.691
or damage to the ozone layer.

00:06:25.715 --> 00:06:30.231
Scientists think that there could be
safe approaches to this,

00:06:30.255 --> 00:06:31.851
but is this really where we are?

00:06:31.875 --> 00:06:34.628
Is this really worth considering?

00:06:35.494 --> 00:06:36.779
This is a simulation

00:06:36.803 --> 00:06:39.407
from the US National Center
for Atmospheric Research

00:06:39.431 --> 00:06:43.866
global climate model showing,
earth surface temperatures through 2100.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:47.883
The globe on the left visualizes
our current trajectory,

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:51.575
and on the right, a world where particles
are introduced into the stratosphere

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:52.994
gradually in 2020,

00:06:53.018 --> 00:06:55.636
and maintained through 2100.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.946
Intervention keeps surface temperatures
near those of today,

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.221
while without it, temperatures rise
well over three degrees.

00:07:04.245 --> 00:07:08.152
This could be the difference
between a safe and an unsafe world.

00:07:09.854 --> 00:07:13.718
So, if there's even a chance
that this could be close to reality,

00:07:13.742 --> 00:07:16.354
is this something
we should consider seriously?

00:07:18.234 --> 00:07:19.965
Today, there are no capabilities,

00:07:19.989 --> 00:07:22.607
and scientific knowledge
is extremely limited.

00:07:23.342 --> 00:07:27.888
We don't know whether these types
of interventions are even feasible,

00:07:27.912 --> 00:07:29.959
or how to characterize their risks.

00:07:30.761 --> 00:07:33.888
Researchers hope to explore
some basic questions

00:07:33.912 --> 00:07:38.071
that might help us know
whether or not these might be real options

00:07:38.095 --> 00:07:39.769
or whether we should rule them out.

00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:44.109
It requires multiple ways
of studying the climate system,

00:07:44.133 --> 00:07:47.245
including computer models
to forecast changes,

00:07:47.269 --> 00:07:49.548
analytic techniques like machine learning,

00:07:49.572 --> 00:07:51.610
and many types of observations.

00:07:52.595 --> 00:07:54.380
And though it's controversial,

00:07:54.404 --> 00:07:58.540
it's also critical that researchers
develop core technologies

00:07:58.564 --> 00:08:01.984
and perform small-scale,
real-world experiments.

00:08:03.186 --> 00:08:06.519
There are two research programs
proposing experiments like this.

00:08:07.408 --> 00:08:11.496
At Harvard, the SCoPEx experiment
would release very small amounts

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:16.996
of sulfates, calcium carbonate and water
into the stratosphere with a balloon,

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.956
to study chemistry and physics effects.

00:08:20.956 --> 00:08:22.295
How much material?

00:08:22.867 --> 00:08:25.552
Less than the amount released
in one minute of flight

00:08:25.576 --> 00:08:27.027
from a commercial aircraft.

00:08:27.654 --> 00:08:30.312
So this is definitely not dangerous,

00:08:30.336 --> 00:08:31.939
and it may not even be scary.

00:08:33.114 --> 00:08:35.179
At the University of Washington,

00:08:35.203 --> 00:08:39.337
scientists hope to spray
a fine mist of salt water into clouds

00:08:39.361 --> 00:08:41.945
in a series of land and ocean tests.

00:08:41.969 --> 00:08:44.780
If those are successful,
this would culminate in experiments

00:08:44.804 --> 00:08:48.048
to measurably brighten
an area of clouds over the ocean.

00:08:48.738 --> 00:08:52.666
The marine cloud brightening effort
is the first to develop any technology

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:56.721
for generating aerosols for atmospheric
sunlight reflection in this way.

00:08:57.166 --> 00:08:59.953
It requires producing
very tiny particles --

00:08:59.977 --> 00:09:04.445
think about the mist that comes
out of an asthma inhaler --

00:09:04.469 --> 00:09:07.669
at massive scale -- so think
of looking up at a cloud.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.713
It's a tricky engineering problem.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.032
So this one nozzle they developed

00:09:13.056 --> 00:09:15.698
generates three trillion
particles per second,

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:17.740
80 nanometers in size,

00:09:17.764 --> 00:09:19.499
from very corrosive saltwater.

00:09:20.681 --> 00:09:24.293
It was developed by a team
of retired engineers in Silicon Valley --

00:09:24.317 --> 00:09:25.859
here they are --

00:09:25.883 --> 00:09:30.887
working full-time for six years,
without pay, for their grandchildren.

00:09:31.334 --> 00:09:34.222
It will take a few million dollars
and another year or two

00:09:34.246 --> 00:09:37.690
to develop the full spray system
they need to do these experiments.

00:09:38.754 --> 00:09:42.353
In other parts of the world,
research efforts are emerging,

00:09:42.377 --> 00:09:46.710
including small modeling programs
at Beijing Normal University in China,

00:09:46.734 --> 00:09:49.063
the Indian Institute of Science,

00:09:49.087 --> 00:09:53.778
a proposed center for climate repair
at Cambridge University in the UK

00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:56.007
and the DECIMALS Fund,

00:09:56.031 --> 00:09:58.730
which sponsors researchers
in global South countries

00:09:58.754 --> 00:10:01.715
to study the potential impacts
of these sunlight interventions

00:10:01.739 --> 00:10:03.135
in their part of the world.

00:10:03.946 --> 00:10:08.048
But all of these programs,
including the experimental ones,

00:10:08.072 --> 00:10:09.672
lack significant funding.

00:10:10.601 --> 00:10:13.512
And understanding
these interventions is a hard problem.

00:10:13.536 --> 00:10:15.958
The earth is a vast, complex system

00:10:15.982 --> 00:10:18.901
and we need major investments
in climate models, observations

00:10:18.925 --> 00:10:20.474
and basic science

00:10:20.498 --> 00:10:24.315
to be able to predict climate
much better than we can today

00:10:24.339 --> 00:10:28.204
and manage both our accidental
and any intentional interventions.

00:10:29.521 --> 00:10:30.728
And it could be urgent.

00:10:32.107 --> 00:10:36.104
Recent scientific reports
predict that in the next few decades,

00:10:36.128 --> 00:10:38.932
earth's fever is on a path to devastation:

00:10:38.956 --> 00:10:40.781
extreme heat and fires,

00:10:41.875 --> 00:10:44.001
major loss of ocean life,

00:10:44.812 --> 00:10:46.676
collapse of Arctic ice,

00:10:47.779 --> 00:10:51.382
displacement and suffering
for hundreds of millions of people.

00:10:52.277 --> 00:10:55.977
The fever could even reach tipping points
where warming takes over

00:10:56.001 --> 00:10:58.238
and human efforts are no longer enough

00:10:58.262 --> 00:11:01.166
to counter accelerating changes
in natural systems.

00:11:01.848 --> 00:11:04.115
To prevent this circumstance,

00:11:04.139 --> 00:11:06.783
the UN's International Panel
on Climate Change predicts

00:11:06.807 --> 00:11:10.314
that we need to stop
and even reverse emissions by 2050.

00:11:11.108 --> 00:11:15.841
How? We have to quickly and radically
transform major economic sectors,

00:11:15.865 --> 00:11:20.104
including energy, construction,
agriculture, transportation and others.

00:11:20.898 --> 00:11:25.403
And it is imperative that we do this
as fast as we can.

00:11:25.427 --> 00:11:27.460
But our fever is now so high

00:11:27.484 --> 00:11:29.692
that climate experts say
we also have to remove

00:11:29.716 --> 00:11:32.668
massive quantities of CO2
from the atmosphere,

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:36.295
possibly 10 times
all of the world's annual emissions,

00:11:36.319 --> 00:11:38.150
in ways that aren't proven yet.

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:43.086
Right now, we have slow-moving solutions
to a fast-moving problem.

00:11:44.015 --> 00:11:46.126
Even with the most optimistic assumptions,

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:49.428
our exposure to risk
in the next 10 to 30 years

00:11:49.452 --> 00:11:51.896
is unacceptably high, in my opinion.

00:11:52.809 --> 00:11:56.492
Could interventions like these
provide fast-acting medicine if we need it

00:11:56.516 --> 00:12:00.060
to reduce the earth's fever
while we address its underlying causes?

00:12:00.621 --> 00:12:03.222
There are real concerns about this idea.

00:12:03.246 --> 00:12:06.610
Some people are very worried
that even researching these interventions

00:12:06.634 --> 00:12:10.786
could provide an excuse to delay efforts
to reduce emissions.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:13.140
This is also known as a moral hazard.

00:12:14.013 --> 00:12:15.894
But, like most medicines,

00:12:15.918 --> 00:12:19.175
interventions are more dangerous
the more that you do,

00:12:19.199 --> 00:12:21.692
so research actually
tends to draw out the fact

00:12:21.716 --> 00:12:24.786
that we absolutely,
positively cannot continue

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.631
to fill up the atmosphere
with greenhouse gases,

00:12:27.655 --> 00:12:30.132
that these kinds of alternatives are risky

00:12:30.156 --> 00:12:32.527
and if we were to use them,

00:12:32.551 --> 00:12:34.926
we would need to use
as little as possible.

00:12:36.746 --> 00:12:38.677
But even so,

00:12:38.701 --> 00:12:41.405
could we ever learn enough
about these interventions

00:12:41.429 --> 00:12:43.005
to manage the risk?

00:12:43.444 --> 00:12:47.210
Who would make decisions
about when and how to intervene?

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.249
What if some people are worse off,

00:12:50.273 --> 00:12:52.101
or they just think they are?

00:12:52.537 --> 00:12:54.386
These are really hard problems.

00:12:55.506 --> 00:13:00.488
But what really worries me
is that as climate impacts worsen,

00:13:00.512 --> 00:13:03.973
leaders will be called on to respond
by any means available.

00:13:04.836 --> 00:13:08.018
I for one don't want them to act
without real information

00:13:08.042 --> 00:13:09.883
and much better options.

00:13:10.758 --> 00:13:13.092
Scientists think it will take
a decade of research

00:13:13.116 --> 00:13:15.265
just to assess these interventions,

00:13:15.289 --> 00:13:17.685
before we ever were
to develop or use them.

00:13:18.392 --> 00:13:22.796
Yet today, the global level of investment
in these interventions

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.871
is effectively zero.

00:13:26.061 --> 00:13:28.792
So, we need to move quickly

00:13:28.816 --> 00:13:32.038
if we want policymakers
to have real information

00:13:32.062 --> 00:13:34.029
on this kind of emergency medicine.

00:13:36.169 --> 00:13:37.319
There is hope!

00:13:38.621 --> 00:13:41.176
The world has solved
these kinds of problems before.

00:13:41.562 --> 00:13:44.966
In the 1970s, we identified
an existential threat

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.760
to our protective ozone layer.

00:13:47.664 --> 00:13:50.498
In the 1980s, scientists,
politicians and industry

00:13:50.522 --> 00:13:54.497
came together in a solution to replace
the chemicals causing the problem.

00:13:54.937 --> 00:13:58.450
They achieved this with the only
legally binding environmental agreement

00:13:58.474 --> 00:14:00.654
signed by all countries in the world,

00:14:00.678 --> 00:14:02.618
the Montreal Protocol.

00:14:02.642 --> 00:14:04.652
Still in force today,

00:14:04.676 --> 00:14:07.460
it has resulted in a recovery
of the ozone layer

00:14:07.484 --> 00:14:10.426
and is the most successful
environmental protection effort

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:11.908
in human history.

00:14:13.104 --> 00:14:15.699
We have a far greater threat now,

00:14:15.723 --> 00:14:19.953
but we do have the ability
to develop and agree on solutions

00:14:19.977 --> 00:14:21.516
to protect people

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.596
and restore our climate to health.

00:14:24.406 --> 00:14:27.176
This could mean that to remain safe,

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.537
we reflect sunlight for a few decades,

00:14:29.561 --> 00:14:32.723
while we green our industries
and remove CO2.

00:14:33.655 --> 00:14:36.917
It definitely means we must work now

00:14:36.941 --> 00:14:41.202
to understand our options
for this kind of emergency medicine.

00:14:41.901 --> 00:14:43.052
Thank you,

00:14:43.076 --> 00:14:47.777
(Applause)
