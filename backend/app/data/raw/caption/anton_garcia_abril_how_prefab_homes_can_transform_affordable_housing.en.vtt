00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.310
Good morning, I'm going to talk about architecture and prefabrication.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.700
How a house could be built?

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.250
And how we could improve

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.790
with the current technology,

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.220
the quality of our living spaces, the affordablility,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.900
and share these with greater markets and people.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.660
We think that this is,

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.180
the present and the future of architecture.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.980
And, this house that we've built in Madrid,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.070
is our manifesto, our starting point.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.430
We prefabricated towards this house,

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.460
You're seeing a civilian engineering parts,

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.780
that perfectly assembled and balanced,

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.140
to demonstrate that how prefabrication could be,

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:08.230
the way to create amazing, inspiring, and affordable spaces to live.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.190
This house was based in these engineering parts,

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.480
balanced in consonance and in harmony,

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.480
in equilibrium with this

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.490
rock of granite of 20 tons that put all their parts together.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.390
This is our house in Madrid.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.390
The Hemeroscopium House

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.690
that is full of air,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.290
and full of life,

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.760
to enable it, the structure, that as you can see,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.790
defers very little the house and the structure that created it.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.020
This house is a space to share with our family,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.820
It's a space to share in conspiracy,

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.500
in communal with outdoors.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.870
in very intimate relationship with nature.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.030
This is the space that we were living in Spain and space that

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.350
we would like to have here in Boston when we came

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.570
at the full of harmony.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.570
This house has been built in Madrid,

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.890
and when we came to Boston,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.690
we were looking for

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.450
a same space, a similar space to live.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.810
We started struggling with "0",

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.670
in the search of housings around.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.230
MIT where I work, POPLab is found that everyone want to be closer with good schools like this one,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.180
and we discovered how insane the prices are,

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.880
how expensive these houses become,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.970
and also how these houses were responding to a(n) old American dream.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.740
a lifestyle, a technology,

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.150
and a formal unspecialized exact was not

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.180
there where we understood house should be.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.100
And also when you come as an migrant to United States,

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.030
you don't have financial history

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.030
and this was part of

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.030
the problem that we have to solve

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.830
so we actually went low to high.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.200
In the sea of browser,

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.680
and we found the cheapest place in the area --

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.910
I think it was a cheapest place in Massachusetts and this was how our dream house.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.720
A three base garage

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.710
very...

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.120
unfinished yet, but with a lot of potential.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.060
(laugh) so we thought

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.800
that we could build a house of our dreams

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.990
I recruited a group of young architects,

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.980
and tell them "let's build the technology that could be

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.680
available and fit the house in Brookline."

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.430
It was the same being, but very light,

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.910
that could be lifted and transported easily,

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.510
and that could be estrangedly insulated to the weather in Boston.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.160
So we got hands on,

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.790
and without being skilled to build a house,

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.480
we crafted a prefabrication

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.020
putting together their technologies

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.540
from their North-Amarican tradition of building houses,

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.380
with our European ones.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.910
Framing but in steel instead of in wood.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.230
creating thick walls but very light

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.990
filled with forth

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.300
and insulating materials that could be clad with cement boards.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.650
It's a different material plate,

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.650
but what we created was a very

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:46.290
affordable lightweight technology that could be packed in a container,

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.480
because we are going to the move to United States

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.990
but not only moving our staff, our furnishing, our memory,

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.990
we are going to move their full house.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.390
So we packed it in containers,

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.610
And we made the trip to United States,

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.210
Their house in one side and our family in the other one.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.670
When we arrived to Brookline, two blocks away from this place,

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.630
It was like receiving an Amazon pack,

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.090
instead of a goodie where the full house that we had to and pack.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.090
Craned and assembled together.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.620
This is what we did in Madrid,

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.760
but with these pieces that came with the kitchen,

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.490
the bathroom, the closets,

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.870
the furnishing, everything was embedded into these walls.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.010
These walls had to be assembled

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.240
with total precision as a Swiss watch.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.450
And it took 7 days,

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.370
of craning,

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.410
and putting all these parts together in perfect balance.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.410
We think that this is the way,

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.730
architecture should move on to make it really affordable,

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:59.090
real technological, and overall, exciting.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.020
We think that architecture has to inspire and create

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.990
a point of space that make our lives better.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.720
There the house was constructed above a garage,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.260
but the garage is still there.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.190
It's coated with a thin layer of vegetation

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.280
that hopefully will grow next spring.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.290
But it was recycle, it wasn't turned on,

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.460
we just created a big room above,

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.640
where all our family could again enjoy all their activities

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.100
without separating ourselves into rooms.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.080
A big room where we could have our meals,

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.550
play, study, do some work,

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.550
and where we could enjoy also,

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.820
the light and the vistas from the neighbors,

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.450
trees, and where at night,

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.220
even all that activity after their dinner,

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:00.810
could be transformed in to a fantastic bedroom.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:06.050
The bed comes from the wall and we still enjoy that big space,

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.050
that we created above.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.300
Good night.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:17.650
(applause).

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.650
(applause).
