00:00:12.698 --> 00:00:13.848
How are we doing?

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.215
No, no, no, by that, I meant,

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:17.920
how are we, homo sapiens "we" ...

00:00:17.944 --> 00:00:18.952
(Laughter)

00:00:18.976 --> 00:00:20.127
doing as a species?

00:00:20.151 --> 00:00:21.161
(Laughter)

00:00:21.185 --> 00:00:23.636
Now the typical way
to answer that question is this.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.785
You choose some measure
of human physical well-being:

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:29.507
average longevity,
average calories per day,

00:00:29.531 --> 00:00:32.173
average income, overall population,
that sort of thing,

00:00:32.197 --> 00:00:35.107
and draw a graph of its value over time.

00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:37.597
In almost every case,
you get the same result.

00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:40.312
The line skitters along
at a low level for millennia,

00:00:40.336 --> 00:00:43.772
then rockets up exponentially
in the 19th and 20th century.

00:00:44.535 --> 00:00:47.156
Or choose a measure of consumption:

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.529
consumption of energy,
consumption of fresh water,

00:00:49.553 --> 00:00:51.624
consumption of the world's photosynthesis,

00:00:51.648 --> 00:00:53.870
and draw a graph of its value over time.

00:00:53.894 --> 00:00:57.966
In the same way, the line skitters along
at a low level for millennia,

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.998
then rockets up exponentially
in the 19th and 20th century.

00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:05.077
Biologists have a word for this: outbreak.

00:01:05.894 --> 00:01:08.507
An outbreak is when
a population or species

00:01:08.531 --> 00:01:10.586
exceeds the bounds of natural selection.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.626
Natural selection ordinarily
keeps populations and species

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.332
within roughly defined limits.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.341
Pests, parasites, lack of resources
prevent them from expanding too much.

00:01:20.365 --> 00:01:23.804
But every now and then,
a species escapes its bounds.

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:26.508
Crown-of-thorns starfish
in the Indian Ocean,

00:01:26.532 --> 00:01:30.112
zebra mussels in the Great Lakes,
spruce budworm here in Canada.

00:01:30.136 --> 00:01:33.279
Populations explode,
a hundredfold, a thousandfold,

00:01:33.303 --> 00:01:34.509
a millionfold.

00:01:35.023 --> 00:01:37.565
So here's a fundamental
lesson from biology:

00:01:37.589 --> 00:01:39.777
outbreaks in nature don't end well.

00:01:40.126 --> 00:01:41.276
(Laughter)

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.580
Put a couple of protozoa
into a petri dish full of nutrient goo.

00:01:46.276 --> 00:01:50.148
In their natural habitat, soil or water,
their environment constrains them.

00:01:50.896 --> 00:01:53.271
In the petri dish, they have
an ocean of breakfast

00:01:53.295 --> 00:01:54.661
and no natural enemies.

00:01:54.685 --> 00:01:57.193
They eat and reproduce, eat and reproduce,

00:01:57.217 --> 00:01:59.476
until bang, they hit
the edge of the petri dish,

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.935
at which point they either
drown in their own waste,

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:03.864
starve from lack of resources, or both.

00:02:03.888 --> 00:02:06.596
The outbreak ends, always, badly.

00:02:06.953 --> 00:02:09.386
Now, from the viewpoint of biology,

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.352
you and I are not fundamentally different
than the protozoa in the petri dish.

00:02:13.884 --> 00:02:15.471
We're not special.

00:02:17.598 --> 00:02:20.734
All the things that we, in our vanity,
think make us different --

00:02:20.758 --> 00:02:23.524
art, science, technology, and so forth,
they don't matter.

00:02:23.548 --> 00:02:24.817
We're an outbreak species,

00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:28.296
we're going to hit the edge
of the petri dish, simple as that.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.177
Well, the obvious question:
Is this actually true?

00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:34.433
Are we in fact doomed
to hit the edge of the petri dish?

00:02:34.457 --> 00:02:36.726
I'd like to set aside
this question for a moment

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.274
and ask you guys another one.

00:02:38.298 --> 00:02:41.369
If we are going to escape biology,
how are we going to do it?

00:02:42.242 --> 00:02:43.830
In the year 2050,

00:02:43.854 --> 00:02:46.349
there will be almost
10 billion people in the world,

00:02:46.373 --> 00:02:49.512
and all of those people will want
the things that you and I want:

00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:52.813
nice cars, nice clothes, nice homes,

00:02:52.837 --> 00:02:54.360
the odd chunk of Toblerone.

00:02:55.064 --> 00:02:57.555
I mean, think of it:
Toblerone for 10 billion people.

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.152
How are we going to do this?

00:02:59.176 --> 00:03:02.016
How are we going to feed everybody,
get water to everybody,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.429
provide power to everybody,
avoid the worst impacts of climate change?

00:03:05.453 --> 00:03:07.230
I'm a science journalist,

00:03:07.254 --> 00:03:10.593
and I've been asking these questions
to researchers for years,

00:03:10.617 --> 00:03:14.594
and in my experience, their answers
fall into two broad categories,

00:03:14.618 --> 00:03:16.577
which I call "wizards" and "prophets."

00:03:16.994 --> 00:03:18.808
Wizards, techno-whizzes,

00:03:18.832 --> 00:03:21.640
believe that science and technology,
properly applied,

00:03:21.664 --> 00:03:24.288
will let us produce
our way out of our dilemmas.

00:03:24.312 --> 00:03:25.989
"Be smart, make more," they say.

00:03:26.013 --> 00:03:27.664
"That way, everyone can win."

00:03:28.537 --> 00:03:30.719
Prophets believe close to the opposite.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.881
They see the world as governed
by fundamental ecological processes

00:03:35.905 --> 00:03:38.663
with limits that we
transgress to our peril.

00:03:39.206 --> 00:03:41.222
"Use less, conserve," they say.

00:03:41.246 --> 00:03:43.317
"Otherwise, everybody's going to lose."

00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:47.689
Wizards and prophets have been
butting their heads together for decades,

00:03:47.713 --> 00:03:51.396
but they both believe that technology
is key to a successful future.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.467
The trouble is, they envision
different types of technology

00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:56.269
and different types of futures.

00:03:56.995 --> 00:04:02.128
Wizards envision a world of glittering,
hyperefficient megacities

00:04:02.152 --> 00:04:05.114
surrounded by vast tracts
of untouched nature,

00:04:05.138 --> 00:04:07.758
economies that have
transitioned from atoms to bits,

00:04:07.782 --> 00:04:09.823
dematerialized capitalist societies

00:04:09.847 --> 00:04:12.076
that no longer depend
on exploiting nature.

00:04:12.755 --> 00:04:15.397
Energy, to wizards,
comes from compact nuclear plants;

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:18.263
food from low-footprint farms
with ultraproductive,

00:04:18.287 --> 00:04:21.095
genetically modified crops
tended by robots;

00:04:21.119 --> 00:04:23.635
water from high-throughput
desalination plants,

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:26.785
which means we no longer
exploit rivers and aquifers.

00:04:27.208 --> 00:04:29.042
Wizards envision all 10 billion of us

00:04:29.066 --> 00:04:31.709
packed into ultradense
but walkable megacities,

00:04:31.733 --> 00:04:34.407
an urbanized world
of maximum human aspiration

00:04:34.431 --> 00:04:35.859
and maximum human liberty.

00:04:36.557 --> 00:04:40.065
Now, prophets object to every bit of this.

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:43.244
You can't dematerialize
food and water, they point out.

00:04:43.557 --> 00:04:45.693
They say, you can't eat bits,

00:04:45.717 --> 00:04:49.241
and industrial agriculture has already
given us massive soil erosion,

00:04:49.265 --> 00:04:52.186
huge coastal dead zones
and ruined soil microbiomes.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.157
And you wizards, you want more of this?

00:04:54.181 --> 00:04:56.599
And those giant desalination plants?

00:04:56.623 --> 00:04:59.592
You know they generate
equally giant piles of toxic salt

00:04:59.616 --> 00:05:01.884
that are basically
impossible to dispose of.

00:05:02.424 --> 00:05:04.608
And those megacities you like?

00:05:04.632 --> 00:05:07.697
Can you name me
an actually existing megacity

00:05:07.721 --> 00:05:10.945
that really exists in the world today,
except for possibly Tokyo,

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:14.048
that isn't a cesspool
of corruption and inequality?

00:05:15.055 --> 00:05:21.691
Instead, prophets pray for a world
of smaller, interconnected communities,

00:05:21.715 --> 00:05:23.881
closer to the earth,

00:05:23.905 --> 00:05:26.922
a more agrarian world
of maximum human connection

00:05:26.946 --> 00:05:28.849
and reduced corporate control.

00:05:30.142 --> 00:05:32.873
More people live
in the countryside in this vision,

00:05:32.897 --> 00:05:36.238
with power provided by neighborhood-scale
solar and wind installations

00:05:36.262 --> 00:05:38.071
that disappear into the background.

00:05:38.698 --> 00:05:42.404
Prophets don't generate water
from giant desalination plants.

00:05:44.044 --> 00:05:46.552
They capture it from rainfall,

00:05:46.576 --> 00:05:49.045
and they reuse and recycle it endlessly.

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:53.489
And the food comes
from small-scale networks of farms

00:05:53.513 --> 00:05:55.419
that focus on trees and tubers

00:05:55.443 --> 00:05:59.181
rather than less productive cereals
like wheat and rice.

00:06:01.286 --> 00:06:04.985
Above all, though, prophets envision
people changing their habits.

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.119
They don't drive to work,
they take their renewable-powered train.

00:06:08.143 --> 00:06:10.650
They don't take 30-minute
hot showers every morning.

00:06:10.674 --> 00:06:13.135
They eat, you know,
like Michael Pollan says,

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:17.054
real food, mostly plants, not too much.

00:06:17.825 --> 00:06:21.333
Above all, prophets say
submitting to nature's restraints

00:06:21.357 --> 00:06:26.205
leads to a freer, more democratic,
healthier way of life.

00:06:26.967 --> 00:06:29.457
Now, wizards regard all this as hooey.

00:06:29.481 --> 00:06:32.949
They see it as a recipe for narrowness,
regression, and global poverty.

00:06:34.314 --> 00:06:37.632
Prophet-style agriculture, they say,
only extends the human footprint

00:06:37.656 --> 00:06:40.704
and shunts more people
into low-wage agricultural labor.

00:06:40.728 --> 00:06:42.659
Those neighborhood-run solar facilities,

00:06:42.683 --> 00:06:44.447
they sound great,

00:06:44.471 --> 00:06:47.176
but they depend on a technology
that doesn't exist yet.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.554
They're a fantasy.

00:06:49.012 --> 00:06:51.838
And recycling water? It's a brake
on growth and development.

00:06:51.862 --> 00:06:55.345
Above all, though, wizards object
to the prophets' emphasis

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:57.407
on wide-scale social engineering,

00:06:57.431 --> 00:06:59.869
which they see as deeply anti-democratic.

00:07:01.105 --> 00:07:05.009
If the history of the last two centuries
was one of unbridled growth,

00:07:05.033 --> 00:07:08.218
the history of the coming century
may well be the choice we make

00:07:08.242 --> 00:07:10.457
as a species between these two paths.

00:07:11.021 --> 00:07:14.918
These are the arguments that will be
resolved, in one way or another,

00:07:14.942 --> 00:07:16.406
by our children's generation,

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.246
the generation that will come
into the world of 10 billion.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.532
Now, but wait, by this point,
biologists should be rolling their eyes

00:07:22.556 --> 00:07:24.442
so loud you can barely hear me speak.

00:07:24.466 --> 00:07:28.163
They should be saying,
all of this, wizards, prophets,

00:07:28.187 --> 00:07:29.539
it's a pipe dream.

00:07:29.563 --> 00:07:33.731
It doesn't matter which illusory path
you think you're taking.

00:07:34.736 --> 00:07:37.172
Outbreaks in nature don't end well.

00:07:37.196 --> 00:07:40.672
I mean, you think the protozoa
see the edge of the petri dish approaching

00:07:40.696 --> 00:07:42.791
and say, "Hey guys,
time to change society"?

00:07:42.815 --> 00:07:44.973
No. They just let her rip.

00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:47.528
That's what life does,
and we're part of life.

00:07:47.552 --> 00:07:49.671
We'll do the same thing. Deal with it.

00:07:50.242 --> 00:07:55.889
Well, if you're a follower of Darwin,
you have to take this into consideration.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.223
I mean, the basic counterargument
boils down to: "We're special."

00:08:00.762 --> 00:08:02.021
How lame is that?

00:08:02.045 --> 00:08:03.536
(Laughter)

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.680
I mean, we can accumulate
and share knowledge

00:08:05.704 --> 00:08:07.528
and use it to guide our future.

00:08:07.552 --> 00:08:09.276
Well, are we actually doing this?

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:14.077
Is there any evidence that we're actually
using our accumulated, shared knowledge

00:08:15.514 --> 00:08:17.522
to guarantee our long-term prosperity?

00:08:18.093 --> 00:08:19.760
It's pretty easy to say no.

00:08:20.398 --> 00:08:21.305
If you're a wizard,

00:08:21.321 --> 00:08:24.759
and you believe that hyperproductive,
genetically engineered crops

00:08:24.783 --> 00:08:27.146
are key to feeding everyone
in tomorrow's world,

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.955
you have to worry that 20 years

00:08:29.979 --> 00:08:32.701
of scientists demonstrating
that they are safe to consume

00:08:32.725 --> 00:08:35.631
has failed to convince the public
to embrace this technology.

00:08:35.655 --> 00:08:36.969
If you're a prophet

00:08:36.993 --> 00:08:41.470
and you believe that key to solving
today's growing shortage of fresh water

00:08:41.494 --> 00:08:43.445
is to stop wasting it,

00:08:43.469 --> 00:08:46.366
you have to worry
that cities around the world,

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.190
in rich places as well as poor,

00:08:48.214 --> 00:08:50.801
routinely lose a quarter
or more of their water

00:08:50.825 --> 00:08:52.960
to leaky and contaminated pipes.

00:08:53.515 --> 00:08:57.044
I mean, Cape Town, just a little
while ago, almost ran out of water.

00:08:57.068 --> 00:08:59.635
Cape Town loses a third
of its water to leaky pipes.

00:08:59.659 --> 00:09:01.976
This problem has been
getting worse for decades,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.595
and remarkably little
has been done about it.

00:09:04.619 --> 00:09:07.868
If you're a wizard, and you think
that clean, abundant,

00:09:07.892 --> 00:09:10.761
carbon-free nuclear power
is key to fighting climate change,

00:09:10.785 --> 00:09:12.026
then you have to worry

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.820
that the public willingness
to build nukes is going down.

00:09:15.455 --> 00:09:18.891
If you're a prophet, and you think
that the solution to the same problem

00:09:18.915 --> 00:09:22.493
is these neighborhood-run solar facilities
shuttling power back and forth,

00:09:22.517 --> 00:09:25.271
you have to worry that no nation
anywhere in the world

00:09:25.295 --> 00:09:29.264
has devoted anything like the resources
necessary to develop this technology

00:09:29.288 --> 00:09:31.791
and deploy it in the time that we need it.

00:09:31.815 --> 00:09:34.153
And if you're on either side,
wizard or prophet,

00:09:34.177 --> 00:09:38.725
you have to worry that, despite
the massive alarm about climate change,

00:09:38.749 --> 00:09:42.702
the amount of energy generated every year
from fossil fuels has gone up

00:09:42.726 --> 00:09:46.057
by about 30 percent
since the beginning of this century.

00:09:46.443 --> 00:09:49.760
So, still think we're different
than the protozoa?

00:09:50.498 --> 00:09:52.768
Still think we're special?

00:09:54.392 --> 00:09:56.955
Actually, it's even worse than that.

00:09:56.979 --> 00:09:59.567
(Laughter)

00:09:59.591 --> 00:10:00.842
We're not in the streets.

00:10:00.866 --> 00:10:04.041
No seriously, if there's a difference
between us and the protozoa,

00:10:04.065 --> 00:10:05.607
a difference that matters,

00:10:05.631 --> 00:10:08.708
it's not just our art and science
and technology and so forth --

00:10:08.732 --> 00:10:11.963
it's that we can yell and scream,
we can go out into the streets,

00:10:11.987 --> 00:10:14.105
and, over time,
change the way society works,

00:10:14.129 --> 00:10:15.383
but we're not doing it.

00:10:15.407 --> 00:10:17.831
Wizards have been arguing
literally for decades

00:10:17.855 --> 00:10:22.831
that nuclear power is key
to resolving climate change.

00:10:24.174 --> 00:10:28.403
But the first pro-nuke march in history
occurred less than two years ago,

00:10:28.427 --> 00:10:31.689
and it was dwarfed by the anti-nuke
marches of the past.

00:10:31.713 --> 00:10:34.839
Prophets have been arguing,
again literally for decades,

00:10:34.863 --> 00:10:38.626
that conservation is key
to keeping freshwater supplies

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:42.485
without destroying the ecosystems
that generate those freshwater supplies.

00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:45.420
But in the history of humankind,
there has never been a street

00:10:45.444 --> 00:10:48.361
full of angry protesters
waving signs about leaky pipes.

00:10:48.985 --> 00:10:52.583
In fact, most of the political
activity in this sphere

00:10:52.607 --> 00:10:56.098
has been wizards and prophets
fighting each other, protesting each other

00:10:56.122 --> 00:10:59.860
rather than recognizing that they are,
fundamentally, on the same side.

00:10:59.884 --> 00:11:03.291
After all, these people are concerned
about the same thing:

00:11:03.315 --> 00:11:06.912
How are we going to make our way
in the world of 10 billion?

00:11:06.936 --> 00:11:10.070
The first step towards generating
that necessary social movement,

00:11:10.094 --> 00:11:13.538
creating that critical mass and getting
that yelling and screaming going

00:11:13.562 --> 00:11:15.923
seems obvious:
wizards and prophets join together.

00:11:15.947 --> 00:11:19.097
But how are you going to do this,
given the decades of hostility?

00:11:19.121 --> 00:11:20.295
One way might be this:

00:11:20.319 --> 00:11:24.668
Each side agrees to accept
the fundamental premises of the other.

00:11:25.837 --> 00:11:29.234
Accept that nuclear power
is safe and carbon-free,

00:11:29.258 --> 00:11:31.805
and that uranium mines
can be hideously dirty

00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:36.154
and that putting large volumes
of toxic waste on rickety trains

00:11:36.178 --> 00:11:39.185
and shuttling them around
the countryside is a terrible idea.

00:11:40.122 --> 00:11:43.655
To me, this leads rather quickly
to a vision of small,

00:11:43.679 --> 00:11:46.347
neighborhood scale, temporary nukes,

00:11:46.371 --> 00:11:49.991
nuclear power as a bridge technology
while we develop and deploy renewables.

00:11:50.015 --> 00:11:53.716
Or accept that genetically
modified crops are safe

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.431
and that industrial agriculture
has caused huge environmental problems.

00:11:57.455 --> 00:12:01.705
To me, this leads rather quickly
to a vision of plant scientists

00:12:01.729 --> 00:12:04.876
devoting much more of their attention
to tree and tuber crops,

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.908
which can be much more
productive than cereals,

00:12:07.932 --> 00:12:11.693
use much less water than cereals,
and cause much less erosion than cereals.

00:12:11.717 --> 00:12:13.904
These are just ideas
from a random journalist.

00:12:13.928 --> 00:12:16.982
I'm sure there's a hundred better ones
right here in this room.

00:12:17.006 --> 00:12:18.157
The main point is,

00:12:18.181 --> 00:12:22.180
wizards and prophets working together
have many paths to success.

00:12:22.204 --> 00:12:24.876
And success would mean
much more than mere survival,

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.151
important though that is.

00:12:26.175 --> 00:12:29.160
I mean, if humankind somehow
survives its own outbreak,

00:12:29.184 --> 00:12:31.626
if we get food to everybody,
get water to everybody,

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:32.807
get power to everybody,

00:12:32.831 --> 00:12:36.928
if we avoid the worst effects
of climate change,

00:12:36.952 --> 00:12:39.011
if we somehow safeguard the biome,

00:12:39.035 --> 00:12:40.265
it would be amazing.

00:12:41.405 --> 00:12:43.186
It would say, I think,

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:45.369
even to a hardened cynic like me,

00:12:45.393 --> 00:12:46.844
maybe we really are special.

00:12:47.615 --> 00:12:48.766
Thank you.

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:55.790
(Applause)
