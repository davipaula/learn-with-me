00:00:13.404 --> 00:00:16.912
What if you could take a pill or a vaccine

00:00:16.936 --> 00:00:18.666
and, just like getting over a cold,

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.785
you could heal your wounds faster?

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:24.331
Today, if we have
an operation or an accident,

00:00:24.355 --> 00:00:25.976
we're in the hospital for weeks,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.626
and often left with scars
and painful side effects

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.785
of our inability to regenerate
or regrow healthy, uninjured organs.

00:00:34.436 --> 00:00:36.462
I work to create materials

00:00:36.486 --> 00:00:40.689
that instruct our immune system to give us
the signals to grow new tissues.

00:00:41.497 --> 00:00:44.571
Just like vaccines instruct
our body to fight disease,

00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:47.323
we could instead instruct
our immune system

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:50.211
to build tissues
and more quickly heal wounds.

00:00:50.886 --> 00:00:54.664
Now, regrowing body parts out of nowhere
might seem like magic,

00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:57.879
but there are several organisms
that can achieve this feat.

00:00:57.903 --> 00:01:00.346
Some lizards can regrow their tails,

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.315
the humble salamander
can completely regenerate their arm,

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.228
and even us mere humans
can regrow our liver

00:01:07.252 --> 00:01:09.823
after losing more than half
of its original mass.

00:01:10.615 --> 00:01:13.250
To make this magic
a bit closer to reality,

00:01:13.274 --> 00:01:17.369
I'm investigating how our body
can heal wounds and build tissue

00:01:17.393 --> 00:01:19.522
through instructions
from the immune system.

00:01:20.387 --> 00:01:23.912
From a scrape on your knee
to that annoying sinus infection,

00:01:23.936 --> 00:01:26.617
our immune system defends
our body from danger.

00:01:27.199 --> 00:01:28.660
I'm an immunologist,

00:01:28.684 --> 00:01:31.714
and by using what I know
about our body's defense system,

00:01:31.738 --> 00:01:33.914
I was able to identify key players

00:01:33.938 --> 00:01:36.626
in our fight to build back
our cuts and bruises.

00:01:37.436 --> 00:01:40.105
When looking at materials
that are currently being tested

00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:42.327
for their abilities to help regrow muscle,

00:01:42.351 --> 00:01:46.510
our team noticed that after treating
an injured muscle with these materials,

00:01:46.534 --> 00:01:48.857
there was a large number of immune cells

00:01:48.881 --> 00:01:51.438
in that material
and the surrounding muscle.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.168
So in this case,

00:01:53.192 --> 00:01:57.406
instead of the immune cells rushing off
towards infection to fight bacteria,

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.517
they're rushing toward an injury.

00:01:59.922 --> 00:02:02.755
I discovered a specific
type of immune cell,

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:04.073
the helper T cell,

00:02:04.097 --> 00:02:06.826
was present inside
that material that I implanted

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.247
and absolutely critical for wound healing.

00:02:10.325 --> 00:02:13.767
Now, just like when you were a kid
and you'd break your pencil

00:02:13.791 --> 00:02:16.329
and try and tape it back together again,

00:02:16.353 --> 00:02:17.507
we can heal,

00:02:17.531 --> 00:02:19.776
but it might not be
in the most functional way,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.173
and we'll get a scar.

00:02:21.515 --> 00:02:24.499
So if we don't have these helper T cells,

00:02:24.523 --> 00:02:26.110
instead of healthy muscle,

00:02:26.134 --> 00:02:28.745
our muscle develops
fat cells inside of it,

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.246
and if there's fat in our muscle,
it isn't as strong.

00:02:32.033 --> 00:02:34.433
Now, using our immune system,

00:02:34.457 --> 00:02:36.954
our body could grow back
without these scars

00:02:36.978 --> 00:02:39.890
and look like what it was
before we were even injured.

00:02:41.128 --> 00:02:43.688
I'm working to create materials

00:02:43.712 --> 00:02:45.991
that give us the signals
to build new tissue

00:02:46.015 --> 00:02:47.855
by changing the immune response.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.055
We know that any time
a material is implanted in our body,

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.134
the immune system will respond to it.

00:02:55.158 --> 00:02:59.667
This ranges from pacemakers
to insulin pumps

00:02:59.691 --> 00:03:03.357
to the materials that engineers are using
to try and build new tissue.

00:03:03.932 --> 00:03:07.997
So when I place that material,
or scaffold, in the body,

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:12.426
the immune system creates
a small environment of cells and proteins

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.322
that can change the way
that our stem cells behave.

00:03:15.817 --> 00:03:19.715
Now, just like the weather
affects our daily activities,

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.064
like going for a run

00:03:21.088 --> 00:03:25.573
or staying inside and binge-watching
an entire TV show on Netflix,

00:03:25.597 --> 00:03:27.565
the immune environment of a scaffold

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:30.414
affects the way that
our stem cells grow and develop.

00:03:30.883 --> 00:03:32.899
If we have the wrong signals,

00:03:32.923 --> 00:03:34.598
say the Netflix signals,

00:03:34.622 --> 00:03:37.486
we get fat cells instead of muscle.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.917
These scaffolds are made
of a variety of different things,

00:03:41.941 --> 00:03:45.306
from plastics to naturally
derived materials,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.081
nanofibers of varying thicknesses,

00:03:48.105 --> 00:03:50.518
sponges that are more or less porous,

00:03:50.542 --> 00:03:52.661
gels of different stiffnesses.

00:03:52.685 --> 00:03:54.795
And researchers
can even make the materials

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.858
release different signals over time.

00:03:57.473 --> 00:04:02.719
So in other words, we can orchestrate
this Broadway show of cells

00:04:02.743 --> 00:04:06.601
by giving them the correct
stage, cues and props

00:04:06.625 --> 00:04:08.846
that can be changed for different tissues,

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.066
just like a producer would change the set

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.013
for "Les Mis" versus
"Little Shop of Horrors."

00:04:14.398 --> 00:04:17.082
I'm combining specific types of signals

00:04:17.106 --> 00:04:21.814
that mimic how our body responds to injury
to help us regenerate.

00:04:22.283 --> 00:04:25.811
In the future, we could see
a scar-proof band-aid,

00:04:25.835 --> 00:04:29.813
a moldable muscle filler
or even a wound-healing vaccine.

00:04:29.837 --> 00:04:33.414
Now, we aren't going to wake up tomorrow
and be able to heal like Wolverine.

00:04:33.438 --> 00:04:35.304
Probably not next Tuesday, either.

00:04:35.328 --> 00:04:36.512
But with these advances,

00:04:36.536 --> 00:04:40.741
and working with our immune system
to help build tissue and heal wounds,

00:04:40.765 --> 00:04:42.994
we could begin seeing
products on the market

00:04:43.018 --> 00:04:46.884
that work with our body's defense system
to help us regenerate,

00:04:46.908 --> 00:04:50.963
and maybe one day be able
to keep pace with a salamander.

00:04:51.876 --> 00:04:53.027
Thank you.

00:04:53.051 --> 00:04:56.690
(Applause)
