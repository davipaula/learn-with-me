00:00:06.837 --> 00:00:12.949
London, 1928: a group of mold spores 
surf a breeze through a lab.

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:15.639
They drift onto a petri dish, 
and when they land,

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.550
they germinate a medical revolution.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.330
This lab belongs to Alexander Fleming, 
a Scottish scientist

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.643
investigating the properties 
of infectious bacteria.

00:00:25.643 --> 00:00:28.780
At this time, 
Fleming is away on vacation.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.690
When he returns, he finds 
a colony of mold growing on a petri dish

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.190
he’d forgotten to place in his incubator.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.678
And around this colony of mold 
is a zone

00:00:37.678 --> 00:00:41.770
completely and unexpectedly 
clear of bacteria.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.250
In studying this mysterious phenomenon,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.111
Fleming came to realize that the mold 
was secreting some kind of compound

00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:51.491
that was killing the bacteria.

00:00:51.491 --> 00:00:54.729
The mold was a species 
in the Penicillium genus,

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:58.877
so Fleming dubbed 
the antibacterial compound “penicillin.”

00:00:58.877 --> 00:01:03.352
What Fleming stumbled upon 
was a microbial defense system.

00:01:03.352 --> 00:01:07.116
The penicillium mold 
constantly produces penicillin

00:01:07.116 --> 00:01:09.547
in order to defend itself from threats,

00:01:09.547 --> 00:01:13.957
such as nearby bacterial colonies 
that might consume its resources.

00:01:13.957 --> 00:01:16.848
Penicillin destroys 
many types of bacteria

00:01:16.848 --> 00:01:19.977
by disrupting synthesis 
of their cell walls.

00:01:19.977 --> 00:01:23.627
These walls get their strength 
from a thick, protective mesh of sugars

00:01:23.627 --> 00:01:25.013
and amino acids,

00:01:25.013 --> 00:01:28.287
that are constantly being 
broken down and rebuilt.

00:01:28.287 --> 00:01:33.006
Penicillin binds to one of the compounds 
that weaves this mesh together

00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:37.643
and prevents the wall from being 
reconstructed at a critical phase.

00:01:37.643 --> 00:01:42.697
Meanwhile, penicillin stimulates 
the release of highly reactive molecules

00:01:42.697 --> 00:01:44.577
that cause additional damage.

00:01:44.577 --> 00:01:47.967
Eventually, the cell’s structure 
breaks down completely.

00:01:47.967 --> 00:01:52.147
This two-pronged attack 
is lethal to a wide range of bacteria,

00:01:52.147 --> 00:01:55.620
whether in petri-dishes, 
our bodies, or elsewhere.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.627
It’s not, however, 
harmful to our own cells,

00:01:58.627 --> 00:02:01.677
because those don’t have cell walls.

00:02:01.677 --> 00:02:04.657
For a decade or so 
after Fleming’s discovery,

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:07.767
penicillin remained 
a laboratory curiosity.

00:02:07.767 --> 00:02:09.657
But during World War II,

00:02:09.657 --> 00:02:13.457
researchers figured out how to isolate 
the active compound

00:02:13.457 --> 00:02:16.727
and grow the mold in larger quantities.

00:02:16.727 --> 00:02:20.007
They then went on to win 
the Nobel Prize for their work.

00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:24.597
Teams at Oxford and several American 
drug companies continued development,

00:02:24.597 --> 00:02:27.921
and within a few years 
it was commercially available.

00:02:27.921 --> 00:02:33.222
Penicillin and similar compounds quickly 
transformed the treatment of infections.

00:02:33.222 --> 00:02:34.502
For the time being,

00:02:34.502 --> 00:02:40.898
they remain some of the most important, 
life-saving antibiotics used in medicine.

00:02:40.898 --> 00:02:47.066
However, the more we use any antibiotic, 
the more bacteria evolve resistance to it.

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:48.736
In the case of penicillin,

00:02:48.736 --> 00:02:53.044
some bacteria produce compounds 
that can break down the key structure

00:02:53.044 --> 00:02:56.000
that interferes with cell wall synthesis.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.394
As antibiotic use has increased,

00:02:58.394 --> 00:03:01.784
more and more bacteria 
have evolved this defense,

00:03:01.784 --> 00:03:04.190
making these antibiotics ineffective

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.684
against a growing number 
of bacterial infections.

00:03:07.684 --> 00:03:12.196
This means it’s essential that doctors 
not overprescribe the drug.

00:03:12.196 --> 00:03:16.975
Meanwhile, 5 to 15% of patients 
in developed countries

00:03:16.975 --> 00:03:19.895
self-identify as allergic to penicillin,

00:03:19.895 --> 00:03:23.494
making it the most commonly reported 
drug allergy.

00:03:23.494 --> 00:03:27.884
However, the vast majority— over 90%—
of people

00:03:27.884 --> 00:03:31.478
who think they’re allergic 
to penicillin actually are not.

00:03:31.478 --> 00:03:33.014
Why the misperception?

00:03:33.014 --> 00:03:36.308
Many patients acquire the allergy label 
as children,

00:03:36.308 --> 00:03:40.028
when a rash appears after they’re treated 
for an infection with penicillin

00:03:40.028 --> 00:03:41.998
or closely related drugs.

00:03:41.998 --> 00:03:44.568
The rash is often blamed on penicillin,

00:03:44.568 --> 00:03:47.598
while the more likely culprit 
is the original infection,

00:03:47.598 --> 00:03:51.718
or a reaction between the infection 
and the antibiotic.

00:03:51.718 --> 00:03:54.518
However, genuine penicillin allergies,

00:03:54.518 --> 00:03:58.268
where our immune systems 
mistake penicillin for an attacker,

00:03:58.268 --> 00:04:01.398
do occur rarely 
and can be very dangerous.

00:04:01.398 --> 00:04:04.118
So if you think you’re allergic 
but don’t know for sure,

00:04:04.118 --> 00:04:06.498
your best bet is to visit an allergist.

00:04:06.498 --> 00:04:08.743
They’ll complete an evaluation 
that’ll confirm

00:04:08.743 --> 00:04:11.033
whether or not you have the allergy.

00:04:11.033 --> 00:04:13.483
Even if you do have a penicillin allergy,

00:04:13.483 --> 00:04:18.584
your immune cells that react to the drug 
may lose their ability to recognize it.

00:04:18.584 --> 00:04:23.066
In fact, about 80% of people 
who are allergic to penicillin

00:04:23.066 --> 00:04:26.116
outgrow their allergy 
within ten years.

00:04:26.116 --> 00:04:28.833
This is great news for people 
who currently identify

00:04:28.833 --> 00:04:30.643
as allergic to penicillin;

00:04:30.643 --> 00:04:35.699
the drug may one day save their lives, 
as it has done for so many others.
