00:00:13.123 --> 00:00:17.872
The Earth is 4.6 billion years old,

00:00:17.896 --> 00:00:22.597
but a human lifetime often lasts
for less than 100 years.

00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:26.508
So why care about
the history of our planet

00:00:26.532 --> 00:00:32.389
when the distant past seems
so inconsequential to everyday life?

00:00:32.849 --> 00:00:34.967
You see, as far as we can tell,

00:00:34.991 --> 00:00:38.226
Earth is the only planet
in our solar system

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.759
known to have sparked life,

00:00:40.783 --> 00:00:46.182
and the only system able to provide
life support for human beings.

00:00:46.763 --> 00:00:48.016
So why Earth?

00:00:48.731 --> 00:00:52.109
We know Earth is unique
for having plate tectonics,

00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:53.686
liquid water on its surface

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.987
and an oxygen-rich atmosphere.

00:00:56.457 --> 00:00:58.775
But this has not always been the case,

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:03.640
and we know this because ancient rocks
have recorded the pivotal moments

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:06.474
in Earth's planetary evolution.

00:01:07.653 --> 00:01:10.636
And one of the best places
to observe those ancient rocks

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.133
is in the Pilbara of Western Australia.

00:01:15.494 --> 00:01:19.994
The rocks here are 3.5 billion years old,

00:01:20.018 --> 00:01:24.624
and they contain some of the oldest
evidence for life on the planet.

00:01:25.298 --> 00:01:27.713
Now, often when we think of early life,

00:01:27.737 --> 00:01:30.955
we might imagine a stegosaurus

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.408
or maybe a fish crawling onto land.

00:01:35.012 --> 00:01:37.240
But the early life that I'm talking about

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:41.189
is simple microscopic life, like bacteria.

00:01:41.745 --> 00:01:45.730
And their fossils are often preserved
as layered rock structures,

00:01:45.754 --> 00:01:47.888
called stromatolites.

00:01:48.515 --> 00:01:53.482
This simple form of life
is almost all we see in the fossil record

00:01:53.506 --> 00:01:57.637
for the first three billion years
of life on Earth.

00:01:58.256 --> 00:02:01.711
Our species can only be traced
back in the fossil record

00:02:01.735 --> 00:02:04.243
to a few hundred thousand years ago.

00:02:04.267 --> 00:02:06.232
We know from the fossil record,

00:02:06.256 --> 00:02:10.306
bacteria life had grabbed
a strong foothold

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.706
by about 3.5 to four billion years ago.

00:02:14.316 --> 00:02:17.955
The rocks older than this
have been either destroyed

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:21.110
or highly deformed
through plate tectonics.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.987
So what remains a missing
piece of the puzzle

00:02:24.011 --> 00:02:28.975
is exactly when and how
life on Earth began.

00:02:31.086 --> 00:02:34.662
Here again is that ancient
volcanic landscape in the Pilbara.

00:02:35.075 --> 00:02:39.902
Little did I know that our research here
would provide another clue

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:42.291
to that origin-of-life puzzle.

00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:44.981
It was on my first field trip here,

00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:49.150
toward the end of a full,
long week mapping project,

00:02:49.174 --> 00:02:52.161
that I came across something
rather special.

00:02:53.026 --> 00:02:56.633
Now, what probably looks like
a bunch of wrinkly old rocks

00:02:56.657 --> 00:02:58.670
are actually stromatolites.

00:02:58.694 --> 00:03:02.821
And at the center of this mound
was a small, peculiar rock

00:03:02.845 --> 00:03:05.523
about the size of a child's hand.

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:11.042
It took six months before we inspected
this rock under a microscope,

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:13.682
when one of my mentors
at the time, Malcolm Walter,

00:03:13.706 --> 00:03:17.566
suggested the rock resembled geyserite.

00:03:18.034 --> 00:03:21.542
Geyserite is a rock type that only forms

00:03:21.566 --> 00:03:25.694
in and around the edges
of hot spring pools.

00:03:26.165 --> 00:03:29.647
Now, in order for you to understand
the significance of geyserite,

00:03:29.671 --> 00:03:33.822
I need to take you back
a couple of centuries.

00:03:35.464 --> 00:03:39.516
In 1871, in a letter
to his friend Joseph Hooker,

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.346
Charles Darwin suggested:

00:03:42.183 --> 00:03:45.904
"What if life started
in some warm little pond

00:03:45.928 --> 00:03:48.047
with all sort of chemicals

00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:52.343
still ready to undergo
more complex changes?"

00:03:52.883 --> 00:03:55.966
Well, we know of warm little ponds.
We call them "hot springs."

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.320
In these environments, you have hot water

00:03:58.344 --> 00:04:01.359
dissolving minerals
from the underlying rocks.

00:04:02.295 --> 00:04:07.354
This solution mixes with organic compounds

00:04:07.378 --> 00:04:10.009
and results in a kind of chemical factory,

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:16.023
which researchers have shown
can manufacture simple cellular structures

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:19.339
that are the first steps toward life.

00:04:19.363 --> 00:04:21.621
But 100 years after Darwin's letter,

00:04:21.645 --> 00:04:25.820
deep-sea hydrothermal vents, or hot vents,
were discovered in the ocean.

00:04:25.844 --> 00:04:28.153
And these are also chemical factories.

00:04:28.177 --> 00:04:31.727
This one is located along
the Tonga volcanic arc,

00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:36.252
1,100 meters below sea level
in the Pacific Ocean.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.258
The black smoke that you see billowing
out of these chimneylike structures

00:04:41.282 --> 00:04:43.099
is also mineral-rich fluid,

00:04:43.123 --> 00:04:46.015
which is being fed off by bacteria.

00:04:46.967 --> 00:04:49.235
And since the discovery
of these deep-sea vents,

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:53.516
the favored scenario for an origin of life
has been in the ocean.

00:04:54.091 --> 00:04:55.674
And this is for good reason:

00:04:57.118 --> 00:05:00.427
deep-sea vents are well-known
in the ancient rock record,

00:05:00.451 --> 00:05:03.516
and it's thought that the early Earth
had a global ocean

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.292
and very little land surface.

00:05:06.316 --> 00:05:11.021
So the probability that deep-sea vents
were abundant on the very early Earth

00:05:11.045 --> 00:05:13.524
fits well with an origin of life

00:05:13.548 --> 00:05:14.828
in the ocean.

00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:17.383
However ...

00:05:18.503 --> 00:05:22.657
our research in the Pilbara
provides and supports

00:05:22.681 --> 00:05:24.943
an alternative perspective.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:31.489
After three years, finally, we were
able to show that, in fact,

00:05:31.513 --> 00:05:34.891
our little rock was geyserite.

00:05:34.915 --> 00:05:38.984
So this conclusion suggested
not only did hot springs exist

00:05:39.008 --> 00:05:43.064
in our 3.5 billion-year-old
volcano in the Pilbara,

00:05:43.088 --> 00:05:49.446
but it pushed back evidence for life
living on land in hot springs

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.709
in the geological record of Earth

00:05:51.733 --> 00:05:55.641
by three billion years.

00:05:56.818 --> 00:06:00.242
And so, from a geological perspective,

00:06:00.266 --> 00:06:07.116
Darwin's warm little pond
is a reasonable origin-of-life candidate.

00:06:09.174 --> 00:06:12.741
Of course, it's still debatable
how life began on Earth,

00:06:12.765 --> 00:06:15.223
and it probably always will be.

00:06:15.247 --> 00:06:17.803
But it is clear that it's flourished;

00:06:17.827 --> 00:06:19.187
it has diversified,

00:06:19.211 --> 00:06:21.737
and it has become ever more complex.

00:06:21.761 --> 00:06:25.083
Eventually, it reached
the age of the human,

00:06:25.107 --> 00:06:28.733
a species that has begun
to question its own existence

00:06:28.757 --> 00:06:31.619
and the existence of life elsewhere:

00:06:32.595 --> 00:06:35.732
Is there a cosmic community
waiting to connect with us,

00:06:35.756 --> 00:06:38.159
or are we all there is?

00:06:38.876 --> 00:06:43.364
A clue to this puzzle again
comes from the ancient rock record.

00:06:44.316 --> 00:06:46.576
At about 2.5 billion years ago,

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.447
there is evidence that bacteria
had begun to produce oxygen,

00:06:51.471 --> 00:06:53.740
kind of like plants do today.

00:06:53.764 --> 00:06:56.235
Geologists refer to
the period that followed

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:58.921
as the Great Oxidation Event.

00:06:59.436 --> 00:07:04.094
It is implied from rocks
called banded iron formations,

00:07:04.118 --> 00:07:09.258
many of which can be observed as
hundreds-of-meter-thick packages of rock

00:07:09.282 --> 00:07:11.443
which are exposed in gorges

00:07:11.467 --> 00:07:14.837
that carve their way through
the Karijini National Park

00:07:14.861 --> 00:07:16.620
in Western Australia.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.527
The arrival of free oxygen allowed
two major changes to occur on our planet.

00:07:21.551 --> 00:07:25.041
First, it allowed complex life to evolve.

00:07:25.065 --> 00:07:29.015
You see, life needs oxygen
to get big and complex.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.744
And it produced the ozone layer,
which protects modern life

00:07:32.768 --> 00:07:36.337
from the harmful effects
of the sun's UVB radiation.

00:07:36.837 --> 00:07:41.798
So in an ironic twist, microbial life
made way for complex life,

00:07:41.822 --> 00:07:45.455
and in essence, relinquished
its three-billion-year reign

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:46.653
over the planet.

00:07:47.161 --> 00:07:50.755
Today, we humans dig up
fossilized complex life

00:07:50.779 --> 00:07:52.241
and burn it for fuel.

00:07:53.154 --> 00:07:57.543
This practice pumps vast amounts
of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere,

00:07:57.567 --> 00:08:00.018
and like our microbial predecessors,

00:08:00.042 --> 00:08:03.484
we have begun to make
substantial changes to our planet.

00:08:04.889 --> 00:08:08.558
And the effects of those
are encompassed by global warming.

00:08:10.793 --> 00:08:15.967
Unfortunately, the ironic twist here
could see the demise of humanity.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.379
And so maybe the reason
we aren't connecting with life elsewhere,

00:08:20.403 --> 00:08:22.436
intelligent life elsewhere,

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.543
is that once it evolves,

00:08:24.567 --> 00:08:27.314
it extinguishes itself quickly.

00:08:28.153 --> 00:08:30.054
If the rocks could talk,

00:08:30.078 --> 00:08:33.100
I suspect they might say this:

00:08:34.345 --> 00:08:37.189
life on Earth is precious.

00:08:38.697 --> 00:08:43.084
It is the product of
four or so billion years

00:08:43.108 --> 00:08:47.812
of a delicate and complex co-evolution

00:08:47.836 --> 00:08:50.349
between life and Earth,

00:08:50.373 --> 00:08:55.657
of which humans only represent
the very last speck of time.

00:08:57.473 --> 00:09:01.741
You can use this information
as a guide or a forecast --

00:09:01.765 --> 00:09:06.964
or an explanation as to why it seems
so lonely in this part of the galaxy.

00:09:08.629 --> 00:09:12.318
But use it to gain some perspective

00:09:13.166 --> 00:09:17.918
about the legacy that you
want to leave behind

00:09:17.942 --> 00:09:22.591
on the planet that you call home.

00:09:24.083 --> 00:09:25.332
Thank you.

00:09:25.356 --> 00:09:28.896
(Applause)
