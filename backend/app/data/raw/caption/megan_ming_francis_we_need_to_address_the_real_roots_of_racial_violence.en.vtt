00:00:09.746 --> 00:00:13.202
I had just finished teaching
Introduction to American Politics

00:00:13.202 --> 00:00:15.723
to a group of eager undergraduates.

00:00:15.723 --> 00:00:17.440
This was my first year teaching,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.672
but I had pulled off a slamming lecture,
and I was feeling good about myself.

00:00:22.532 --> 00:00:26.446
As I left the classroom,
I looked down at my phone

00:00:26.446 --> 00:00:31.057
and saw that I had five missed calls
from my brother Kenny.

00:00:31.057 --> 00:00:35.595
At the time, Kenny was a student
at Temple University

00:00:35.595 --> 00:00:37.283
and living in North Philly.

00:00:37.283 --> 00:00:39.230
For those who don't know North Philly,

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.322
it's an area that is predominantly
black and low-income,

00:00:42.322 --> 00:00:45.270
with a very visible police presence.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.834
When I returned his phone call,
Kenny is loud and swearing into the phone.

00:00:50.834 --> 00:00:54.392
I can tell that something
very bad happened,

00:00:54.392 --> 00:00:57.035
but I'm not sure what.

00:00:57.035 --> 00:01:00.481
When I'm finally able
to get him to calm down,

00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:04.027
he tells me how he was sitting
on the stoop of his building

00:01:04.027 --> 00:01:06.214
talking to a friend

00:01:06.214 --> 00:01:08.984
when four police officers ran up on him

00:01:08.984 --> 00:01:12.423
and threw him and three
others on the ground,

00:01:12.423 --> 00:01:16.012
handcuffed them and then
pushed them up against a wall,

00:01:16.012 --> 00:01:17.409
all the while asking them,

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.924
"What drugs do you have?
What drugs do you have?"

00:01:20.924 --> 00:01:22.449
Kenny had no drugs.

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:25.404
He told the officers this many times,

00:01:25.404 --> 00:01:29.270
but each statement of no drugs
only seemed to provoke more force

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.137
and make the officers more upset.

00:01:32.137 --> 00:01:36.527
As Kenny sat, cuffed,
and slumped against a brick wall,

00:01:36.527 --> 00:01:40.782
he quietly told the officers that he was
a student at Temple University

00:01:40.782 --> 00:01:43.842
and without reason,
they could not hold him.

00:01:43.842 --> 00:01:46.520
The officers finally retrieved
his college ID,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.680
which was in his wallet
that had slipped out

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.839
when he was slammed to the pavement,

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:54.147
realized that he was indeed
in college, without drugs,

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:56.233
and then let him go.

00:01:56.233 --> 00:02:00.656
After Kenny told me this story,
he was still loud and upset.

00:02:00.656 --> 00:02:02.345
I was shaking,

00:02:02.345 --> 00:02:05.748
barely able to hold the phone to my ear,

00:02:05.748 --> 00:02:09.437
all of the joy from my great day
of teaching - gone ...

00:02:09.437 --> 00:02:13.423
and replaced with a deep sense
of helplessness and alarm.

00:02:13.753 --> 00:02:16.886
I wanted to remove the hurt
and frustration that Kenny felt,

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:20.428
that I could hear so clearly
through the phone,

00:02:20.428 --> 00:02:23.640
but I neither had the will
nor the ability to lie to him

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.076
about the mightiness of American racism.

00:02:26.076 --> 00:02:29.730
And we both silently knew
that this would not be the last time

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.299
that he would be stopped
and frisked by the police for drugs.

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:36.070
In an attempt to try to calm him down

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.256
and to shift attention onto something
that he perhaps did have control over,

00:02:41.256 --> 00:02:42.769
I had this genius idea

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.092
and suggested that he focused
his attention on school work

00:02:46.092 --> 00:02:48.341
to kind of take his mind off of things.

00:02:48.341 --> 00:02:51.840
He yells into the phone at me,
"What is that going to do?

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.652
Why should I focus on my school work

00:02:53.652 --> 00:02:56.706
when the police are allowed
to do things like this?"

00:02:56.706 --> 00:02:58.034
And then he says to me,

00:02:58.034 --> 00:03:02.159
"I'm not a student in your class, Megan.
Your books are not going to save me."

00:03:03.621 --> 00:03:06.432
I silently nodded
on the other end of the phone,

00:03:06.432 --> 00:03:09.384
In a lifetime of often heated
exchanges with him,

00:03:09.384 --> 00:03:12.736
I've probably never been more wrong,

00:03:12.736 --> 00:03:15.420
and he has never been more right.

00:03:16.512 --> 00:03:18.157
Kenny is not alone.

00:03:18.577 --> 00:03:23.479
This violent interaction between black men
and women, and police officers

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:27.040
plays out in cities and towns
across the United States,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.307
often with much more devastating results.

00:03:30.307 --> 00:03:32.963
According to the most recent statistics,

00:03:32.963 --> 00:03:38.181
blacks are three times more likely to be
shot and killed by police than whites.

00:03:38.854 --> 00:03:40.870
The question on everyone's mind

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.883
and the question
that I get asked the most

00:03:42.883 --> 00:03:45.622
is, "How do we solve this problem?"

00:03:45.622 --> 00:03:49.077
And I confess I cringe at this question,

00:03:49.877 --> 00:03:52.676
not because it's not a good question,

00:03:52.676 --> 00:03:56.701
but because I think we're asking
the wrong question.

00:03:57.134 --> 00:03:59.687
I'm not convinced we even understand

00:03:59.687 --> 00:04:02.882
how we got to this point
in the fist place.

00:04:03.537 --> 00:04:07.991
Better understanding of the root causes
of the current place where we are

00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:12.405
will help provide us with the tools
that we need to move us forward.

00:04:13.157 --> 00:04:14.901
However, I confess

00:04:14.901 --> 00:04:19.032
that even I sometimes am more eager
to solve a problem

00:04:19.032 --> 00:04:21.213
than I am to understand it.

00:04:21.213 --> 00:04:24.986
So a few years ago,
I adopted a corgi from a shelter

00:04:24.986 --> 00:04:28.407
and named him President Bartlet,
off of The West Wing.

00:04:28.407 --> 00:04:30.077
(Laughter)

00:04:30.077 --> 00:04:32.187
Now, he's super adorable!

00:04:32.187 --> 00:04:33.804
But he was abused,

00:04:33.804 --> 00:04:37.163
and he's very aggressive
whenever he sees another dog.

00:04:37.163 --> 00:04:41.978
My fix in my first year was to walk him
at crazy hours of the day,

00:04:41.978 --> 00:04:45.765
but this worked only marginally well,

00:04:45.765 --> 00:04:48.496
and I was stressed and tired.

00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:51.746
The following year,
I decided to hire a trainer

00:04:51.746 --> 00:04:57.052
to try to figure the underlying issues
behind his reactive behavior.

00:04:57.418 --> 00:05:01.558
On the first day of our meeting,
the trainer looks at me and says,

00:05:01.558 --> 00:05:06.814
"Fixes that do not address the root causes
of an issue are not really fixes at all."

00:05:07.484 --> 00:05:11.627
I realized that in my haste
to fix President Bartlet,

00:05:11.627 --> 00:05:14.112
I actually had made him worse.

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.936
The present crisis surrounding race
in the United States, I think,

00:05:17.936 --> 00:05:21.834
suffers from a lack of attention
to the root causes;

00:05:21.834 --> 00:05:24.096
Better attention to the root causes,

00:05:24.096 --> 00:05:25.346
I am convinced,

00:05:25.346 --> 00:05:31.170
will help us to figure out
how to move past where we right now

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.090
in terms of the current racial climate
in the United States.

00:05:36.675 --> 00:05:40.756
So why does the killing
of unarmed blacks to continue to happen?

00:05:42.057 --> 00:05:43.566
I think it continues to happen

00:05:43.566 --> 00:05:47.701
because we have the wrong diagnosis
and the wrong cure.

00:05:48.185 --> 00:05:50.432
And what I mean by this
is we tend to think

00:05:50.432 --> 00:05:54.935
the problem of racial violence
is isolated to a few stubborn racists

00:05:54.935 --> 00:05:57.739
that haven't yet drunk
kind of this progressive Kool-Aid.

00:05:57.739 --> 00:06:02.351
And we tend to think the cure
to racial injustices in the United States

00:06:02.351 --> 00:06:05.162
should always revolve around education.

00:06:05.981 --> 00:06:10.023
In the rest of my talk today,
I'm going to challenge both of these ideas

00:06:10.023 --> 00:06:13.798
and suggest a new way
to understand the problem,

00:06:13.798 --> 00:06:15.794
as well as the solution.

00:06:16.912 --> 00:06:20.080
First, part of the reason
the killing of unarmed blacks

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.245
continues to happen at an alarming rate

00:06:23.245 --> 00:06:25.380
is because we haven't properly addressed

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.706
our long history of
racial terror in this country,

00:06:28.706 --> 00:06:32.027
which has treated blackness
as a proxy for criminality,

00:06:32.027 --> 00:06:34.949
as a substitute for criminality.

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:39.179
Instead, when confronted with
kind of these jarring racial injustices,

00:06:39.179 --> 00:06:43.206
what we like to do is to point 
to the bad racist apples.

00:06:43.206 --> 00:06:47.801
We like to individualize the problem
and situate it away from us.

00:06:47.801 --> 00:06:51.624
This is why we're able to make sense
of, let's say, a Dylann Roof,

00:06:51.624 --> 00:06:54.500
the shooter in Charlston, South Carolina,

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.928
who shot up the black church
and had a white-power manifesto.

00:06:58.368 --> 00:07:00.664
But the problem with
contemporary racial violence

00:07:00.664 --> 00:07:03.943
is not that we have
a few kind of racist bad apples.

00:07:03.943 --> 00:07:09.742
The problem is that the whole tree,
the whole apple tree, is infected.

00:07:10.522 --> 00:07:15.329
The problem is that the presumption
of dangerousness is tightly bound to race

00:07:15.329 --> 00:07:18.013
for so many in this country.

00:07:18.668 --> 00:07:21.928
For police officers
to justify the use of deadly force,

00:07:21.928 --> 00:07:25.994
they have to reasonably believe
that their lives are in danger.

00:07:26.388 --> 00:07:30.155
In all the high-profile killings
of blacks over the past year,

00:07:30.155 --> 00:07:33.331
officers attest to feeling under threat.

00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:37.690
But what does this mean
in the context of unarmed citizens?

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.961
It means that black skin
triggers a heightened sense of threat,

00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:43.608
a life-threatening sense of threat,

00:07:43.608 --> 00:07:48.497
that then influences the officers'
decision to use deadly force.

00:07:48.497 --> 00:07:50.449
According to the most recent statistics,

00:07:50.449 --> 00:07:54.414
33% of blacks that have been killed
by police were unarmed.

00:07:54.844 --> 00:07:58.988
But it's not just police
that pop up this myth of black danger.

00:07:58.988 --> 00:08:02.816
This myth gets reinforced
and takes on a truth-like quality

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:05.159
through everyday interaction,

00:08:05.599 --> 00:08:08.155
when a black man passes
and a woman clutches her purse

00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:11.858
or when a group
of black friends walk by a car

00:08:11.858 --> 00:08:16.436
and hear the jarring sound of someone
who has just pushed their automatic locks

00:08:16.436 --> 00:08:18.813
because they are afraid.

00:08:18.813 --> 00:08:22.164
And I have friends on both sides of this:

00:08:22.824 --> 00:08:25.117
black men with great jobs,

00:08:25.117 --> 00:08:28.505
who just want to be viewed
as a person and not as a threat

00:08:28.505 --> 00:08:30.607
after a long day of work;

00:08:30.607 --> 00:08:33.897
and I have really great
white and Asian woman friends,

00:08:33.897 --> 00:08:35.808
who clutch their purse and walk quickly

00:08:35.808 --> 00:08:38.424
if they see a black man
on a dimly-lit street,

00:08:38.424 --> 00:08:42.349
and then feel ashamed in the need
to over-explain their actions to me.

00:08:43.099 --> 00:08:44.966
And I've also been on the receiving end

00:08:44.966 --> 00:08:46.378
of having who I was

00:08:46.378 --> 00:08:51.582
reduced to someone else's false perception
of how much of a danger I posed.

00:08:52.142 --> 00:08:56.781
Last year, I was coming back from a trip,
and I was singled out by the TSA agent.

00:08:56.781 --> 00:09:00.350
I thought that I had left a water bottle,
like I often do, in my bag.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:02.636
But he ushered me to a separate area,

00:09:02.636 --> 00:09:05.717
and then two more TSA agents
surrounded me,

00:09:05.717 --> 00:09:09.977
and I knew in my gut
that something bad was about to go down.

00:09:10.447 --> 00:09:14.451
The lead TSA agent
proceeds to ask - no, accuse - me

00:09:14.451 --> 00:09:17.259
of bringing a weapon into the airport.

00:09:17.259 --> 00:09:20.979
When I insisted that I did not bring
a weapon into the airport,

00:09:20.979 --> 00:09:23.678
he produces a piece of costume jewelry,

00:09:23.678 --> 00:09:27.920
a double ring that I had picked up
for $4 on vacation.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.120
It was like his "gotcha" moment,
and it was my superconfused moment.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.155
(Laughter)

00:09:34.155 --> 00:09:39.326
He then accuses me of bringing
brass knuckles, a deadly weapon,

00:09:39.326 --> 00:09:41.441
into a United States airport.

00:09:42.161 --> 00:09:47.553
I was almost at a loss of words,
which is rare for someone like me,

00:09:47.553 --> 00:09:50.025
but I politely pointed out to him

00:09:50.025 --> 00:09:53.168
that the ring was plastic,
it wasn't brass,

00:09:53.168 --> 00:09:54.476
and these weren't knuckles,

00:09:54.476 --> 00:09:59.089
it was just a ring that went
over two fingers instead of one finger.

00:09:59.089 --> 00:10:02.228
But have you ever talked to someone
and felt like you didn't exist,

00:10:02.228 --> 00:10:05.252
like when they spoke to you,
they spoke right through you?

00:10:05.252 --> 00:10:06.970
Well, that's how I felt.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:10.436
He got more angry at my explanations,
looked me in my face, and said,

00:10:10.436 --> 00:10:12.312
"You people always lie.

00:10:12.312 --> 00:10:13.792
I know that this is a weapon,

00:10:13.792 --> 00:10:18.172
and I'm not going to let someone
dangerous like you board a plane today."

00:10:18.922 --> 00:10:20.520
Well, I started to shake, right?

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.091
Because we've all seen this movie
about the brown girl

00:10:23.091 --> 00:10:25.360
who walks into the airport
with a deadly weapon,

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.255
and it never really ends well for her.

00:10:27.255 --> 00:10:29.892
It doesn't. It never does.

00:10:31.602 --> 00:10:35.455
So, I had to do what I hate doing,

00:10:35.455 --> 00:10:39.447
and I used my credentials
to get me out of a bad situation.

00:10:39.447 --> 00:10:42.121
I told him that I was a professor

00:10:42.121 --> 00:10:45.263
of Constitutional Law
and American Politics.

00:10:45.263 --> 00:10:47.470
(Laughter)

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:48.852
Right?

00:10:48.852 --> 00:10:50.082
(Applause)

00:10:50.082 --> 00:10:52.079
Yeah, so -

00:10:52.079 --> 00:10:53.944
(Applause)

00:10:55.234 --> 00:10:58.968
I cited US criminal code,
landmark Supreme Court decisions,

00:10:58.968 --> 00:11:01.250
and rules from the
Homeland Security Rulebook,

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.154
because I also teach Civil Liberties.

00:11:04.794 --> 00:11:07.472
And then he started to get very nervous.

00:11:07.472 --> 00:11:09.503
(Laughter)

00:11:09.503 --> 00:11:12.010
He asked what school I worked at.

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:15.600
I told him, he Googled my name,
and the blood drained from his face.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.681
Right?

00:11:16.681 --> 00:11:18.969
As he realized I wasn't making this up,

00:11:18.969 --> 00:11:21.735
I knew my rights
and I was a college professor.

00:11:22.245 --> 00:11:26.333
And then, when he looked back at me,
he finally saw me,

00:11:26.333 --> 00:11:30.089
not as a dangerous threat,
but as a person.

00:11:30.799 --> 00:11:34.929
After a few more minutes, he let me go,
to catch my much delayed flight,

00:11:34.929 --> 00:11:36.843
I found a seat in the airport terminal,

00:11:36.843 --> 00:11:40.424
still trembling with rage
at the way that I had been treated.

00:11:40.884 --> 00:11:45.772
I was only seated for a few minutes
when I felt a tap on my shoulder.

00:11:45.772 --> 00:11:49.412
A woman airport worker
said that she saw my whole ordeal,

00:11:49.412 --> 00:11:52.741
and that he does this all the time
to black passengers,

00:11:52.741 --> 00:11:56.625
and I was lucky to have been released
from his custody so quickly.

00:11:56.625 --> 00:11:59.610
But it shouldn't take
a university website profile

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:02.924
to be viewed as non-threatening, right?

00:12:02.924 --> 00:12:05.875
(Applause)

00:12:10.775 --> 00:12:14.367
Part of the reason I shared this story
and some of the other ones

00:12:14.367 --> 00:12:17.708
is that I think, in talking about
the current racial crisis,

00:12:17.708 --> 00:12:20.423
we tend to focus
all of our attention on police

00:12:20.423 --> 00:12:24.132
and overlook our own complicity
in creating an environment

00:12:24.132 --> 00:12:27.389
in which black lives
are not treated as equal.

00:12:27.389 --> 00:12:30.337
To be clear in thinking about
solutions to the racial violence,

00:12:30.337 --> 00:12:31.793
I'm in favor of body cameras,

00:12:31.793 --> 00:12:34.823
I'm in favor of a
non-militarized police force,

00:12:34.823 --> 00:12:39.092
I'm in favor of stricter laws
that make officers more accountable

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:41.706
when they stop and frisk
people on the street.

00:12:41.706 --> 00:12:43.268
But i'm not convinced

00:12:43.268 --> 00:12:45.873
that we would need something
like body cameras

00:12:45.873 --> 00:12:47.544
if we didn't live in a society

00:12:47.544 --> 00:12:50.126
that treat blacks
as dangerous and suspicious first,

00:12:50.126 --> 00:12:52.580
and as citizens second.

00:12:53.808 --> 00:12:59.533
It's not just a few bad racist apples
in a police department or at an airport;

00:12:59.533 --> 00:13:03.841
it's all of us, who in big ways
through our actions

00:13:03.841 --> 00:13:06.211
and in small ways by our silences,

00:13:06.211 --> 00:13:08.990
support this lie - because
that's what it is, it's a lie -

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:13.129
that somehow black folk
are more dangerous than the rest of us.

00:13:13.919 --> 00:13:18.009
So not only do I believe
that we've misdiagnosed the problem,

00:13:18.009 --> 00:13:21.611
I also think we have the wrong cure to it.

00:13:21.611 --> 00:13:23.638
We keep offering up education

00:13:23.638 --> 00:13:27.200
as a solution to all racial injustices
in the United States.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.550
It's kind of what I call
sometimes in my classes

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:31.941
as the "Robitussin of civil rights."

00:13:31.941 --> 00:13:34.277
Like, when I was little,
my mom loved Robitussin.

00:13:34.277 --> 00:13:35.480
She would give me it.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.684
I got a cold, Robitussin; flu, Robitussin

00:13:37.684 --> 00:13:39.366
Like, allergies? Robitussin.

00:13:39.366 --> 00:13:41.090
Like, where's the Penadryl?

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:42.640
(Laughter)

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:47.518
But just like Robitussin is not a cure-all
for all types of sicknesses,

00:13:48.257 --> 00:13:52.922
education is not a cure-all
for all of America's racial sins.

00:13:52.922 --> 00:13:57.200
And yet, education is still
how most Americans understand

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.626
the responsibility to fixing
contemporary racial injustices.

00:14:02.235 --> 00:14:06.105
Our measure of how far we have come
in the area of race relations

00:14:06.105 --> 00:14:10.168
is most often calculated
in how integrated our schools are,

00:14:10.168 --> 00:14:14.358
how many inovative education experiments
are currently going on,

00:14:14.358 --> 00:14:18.763
and how many federal dollars
are committed towards education.

00:14:20.436 --> 00:14:25.628
But the contemporary problem
surrounding the killing of unarmed blacks

00:14:25.628 --> 00:14:26.629
is not a problem

00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:30.758
that boils down to providing greater
educational opportunities to blacks.

00:14:30.758 --> 00:14:32.685
This is a misdiagnosis.

00:14:33.349 --> 00:14:36.932
A book is not going to stop the bullet
barreling through a gun at Rekia Boyd

00:14:36.932 --> 00:14:38.447
in Chicago,

00:14:38.447 --> 00:14:42.435
and longer classroom times
are not going to save Freddie Gray

00:14:42.435 --> 00:14:46.865
from being illegally stopped
and manhandled by police in Baltimore.

00:14:47.505 --> 00:14:49.258
This is what I know for sure:

00:14:49.658 --> 00:14:52.748
that in order to combat
continuing racial injustices today,

00:14:52.748 --> 00:14:55.892
we must expand our vision
and our responsibility

00:14:55.892 --> 00:14:58.099
to what civil rights actually means.

00:14:58.099 --> 00:15:01.081
We must include the battle
against racist violence

00:15:01.081 --> 00:15:04.152
in our understanding of civil rights.

00:15:04.152 --> 00:15:06.077
Instead of education,

00:15:06.077 --> 00:15:08.917
what if we placed freedom
from racist violence

00:15:08.917 --> 00:15:13.619
at the crux of what it means to be free
and equal in the United States?

00:15:14.287 --> 00:15:18.347
Doing so does not mean
that we necessarily dislodge education,

00:15:18.347 --> 00:15:23.018
but it means that if racism
and white supremacy are a rock fortress,

00:15:23.018 --> 00:15:26.955
we assemble greater arsenal weapons
to break the damn thing down.

00:15:28.765 --> 00:15:31.682
(Applause)

00:15:33.377 --> 00:15:37.744
I know this is not an easy task,
but I know that it can be done.

00:15:38.266 --> 00:15:39.265
So in my real life,

00:15:39.265 --> 00:15:41.856
I'm a political scientist and a historian,

00:15:41.856 --> 00:15:45.978
and I've spent the last 10 years
focused on a surprising finding:

00:15:45.978 --> 00:15:51.599
that before the civil rights
group the NAACP

00:15:51.599 --> 00:15:53.655
focused on its historic campaign
against segregated education,

00:15:53.655 --> 00:15:58.083
the NAACP spent the first two decades
of the 20th century

00:15:58.083 --> 00:16:02.572
focused on fighting escalating levels
of racial violence that blacks endured

00:16:02.572 --> 00:16:07.075
as a result of the actions from police,
politicians, and private white citizens

00:16:07.075 --> 00:16:09.270
in the south and in the north.

00:16:09.868 --> 00:16:13.648
In order to wage this big campaign
against racial violence,

00:16:13.648 --> 00:16:18.354
the NAACP organized
mass demonstrations in the streets.

00:16:18.354 --> 00:16:21.698
They lobbied Congress
to pass an anti-lynching bill.

00:16:22.016 --> 00:16:26.985
They litigated and won a landmark decision
in front of the Supreme Court.

00:16:26.985 --> 00:16:29.494
And they petitioned
three different presidents

00:16:29.494 --> 00:16:31.995
to make a statement against lynching.

00:16:31.995 --> 00:16:35.905
It was this massive, extraordinary,
in-your-face campaign

00:16:35.905 --> 00:16:39.986
that forced America to confront
lynching and mob violence

00:16:39.986 --> 00:16:42.436
against African Americans.

00:16:42.436 --> 00:16:43.920
It asked America

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.478
how strong was its commitment
to protecting black lives.

00:16:48.608 --> 00:16:51.875
As a result of this work
in early 20th century,

00:16:51.875 --> 00:16:56.557
the rates of lynching and mob violence
dramatically decreased.

00:16:57.353 --> 00:17:01.224
I tell this story about the NAACP's
historic kind of campaign

00:17:01.224 --> 00:17:03.062
against racial violence

00:17:03.062 --> 00:17:07.640
because I believe our past history can
light a way out of the present darkness.

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:10.605
If we listen to what
this history tells us,

00:17:10.605 --> 00:17:14.665
then we must struggle
through this current moment.

00:17:14.665 --> 00:17:19.415
We must confront the ways
that our actions and our institutions

00:17:19.415 --> 00:17:24.678
lead to a differential treatment
of blacks, even if done unintentionally.

00:17:26.838 --> 00:17:30.575
Today, people across the United States
are taking to streets

00:17:30.575 --> 00:17:32.931
and are demanding to be seen,

00:17:33.561 --> 00:17:35.188
not as dangerous

00:17:35.188 --> 00:17:40.011
but as people whose lives have value
and deserve protection.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.755
Some of these groups are associated
directly, and some indirectly,

00:17:43.755 --> 00:17:46.213
with the Black Lives Matter movement.

00:17:46.213 --> 00:17:48.521
Without the efforts of these groups,

00:17:48.521 --> 00:17:50.727
so many of these killings
of unarmed blacks

00:17:50.727 --> 00:17:52.574
would have been swapped under the rug,

00:17:52.574 --> 00:17:56.631
and we would have lost attention long ago.

00:17:57.439 --> 00:18:01.903
But so many of these activists
have denied the comforts of silence,

00:18:01.903 --> 00:18:04.972
and they are being active
around this issue.

00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:08.271
Their message and my message to you today

00:18:08.271 --> 00:18:12.916
is that we must pay closer attention
to the way that black people are treated.

00:18:13.446 --> 00:18:18.275
The story of police brutality
and killings of unarmed blacks

00:18:18.275 --> 00:18:20.734
is not a story about black people.

00:18:21.195 --> 00:18:23.172
It's a story about all of us,

00:18:23.172 --> 00:18:27.675
about racial progress and the stubborn
durability of American racism.

00:18:27.675 --> 00:18:31.094
It's about if we will stop making
the mistakes of our past

00:18:31.094 --> 00:18:34.148
and confront our own complicity
in this great American lie

00:18:34.148 --> 00:18:37.228
that somehow black people
are more dangerous than others.

00:18:37.758 --> 00:18:40.525
And finally, it's about
if we have the courage

00:18:40.525 --> 00:18:44.583
to take a collective stand
against racial injustice today.

00:18:47.219 --> 00:18:50.766
This year, nearly half of my students

00:18:50.766 --> 00:18:53.247
in my race and politics
upper division course

00:18:53.247 --> 00:18:58.141
participated in a walkout in support
of the Black Lives Matter movement.

00:18:58.141 --> 00:18:59.877
Halfway through my lecture,

00:18:59.877 --> 00:19:02.334
I could hear the swelling crowd

00:19:02.334 --> 00:19:05.006
of students, teachers
and community members

00:19:05.006 --> 00:19:07.963
in the Quad at the University
of Washington.

00:19:08.433 --> 00:19:13.867
I smiled to myself as I had a flashback
to the conversation that I had with Kenny,

00:19:13.867 --> 00:19:15.488
now five years ago.

00:19:16.368 --> 00:19:18.028
He was right, of course.

00:19:18.028 --> 00:19:21.342
My books and my silence
will not save these students,

00:19:21.342 --> 00:19:22.693
but their activism,

00:19:22.693 --> 00:19:26.738
their courage in challenging
the status quo, and this movement

00:19:26.738 --> 00:19:27.829
just might.

00:19:27.829 --> 00:19:29.193
Thanks.

00:19:29.193 --> 00:19:31.284
(Applause)
