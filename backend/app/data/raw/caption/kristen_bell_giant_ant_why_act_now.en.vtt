00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:02.737
Why act now?

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.941
The best time to act was yesterday.

00:00:05.965 --> 00:00:08.253
The second best time is today.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.531
Every year that we don't reduce emissions

00:00:11.555 --> 00:00:15.176
represents another 55 gigatons
of greenhouse gases

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.369
that future generations
will have to scrub out of the air.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.256
That would cost 8 trillion dollars a year,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.356
almost half the entire US economy today.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.096
And that price doesn't include
the cost of people forced to move,

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.489
the natural world transformed
and lives lost.

00:00:33.093 --> 00:00:35.916
It's much cheaper
to develop new technologies

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.006
that don't emit carbon dioxide

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.876
than to capture carbon dioxide
that we've already emitted.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:48.206
Every ton of carbon dioxide we emit now
imposes a burden on us and the planet,

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.568
but also a debt that would
have to be paid by our children

00:00:51.592 --> 00:00:53.873
and untold generations to come.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.472
The sooner we start fixing this,
the easier it'll be.

00:00:57.496 --> 00:00:59.526
So do what you can where you can.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.426
Vote, change your diet and your commute,

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.846
organize, plant trees, advocate for ideas,

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.386
advocate for science

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.311
and most importantly,
advocate for action today.
