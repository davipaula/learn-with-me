00:00:12.817 --> 00:00:16.087
So I had this very interesting experience

00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:17.261
five years ago.

00:00:18.278 --> 00:00:21.103
You know, me and my husband,
we were out grocery shopping,

00:00:21.127 --> 00:00:22.720
as we do every other day,

00:00:22.744 --> 00:00:26.093
but this time, we found this fancy,

00:00:26.117 --> 00:00:29.839
you know, I'm talking fair-trade,
I'm talking organic,

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.395
I'm talking Kenyan, single-origin coffee

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.152
that we splurged and got.

00:00:35.252 --> 00:00:38.554
And that was when the problem
started already.

00:00:38.578 --> 00:00:42.418
You know, my husband,
he deemed this coffee blend superior

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:44.831
to our regular and much cheaper coffee,

00:00:44.855 --> 00:00:49.204
which made me imagine a life
based solely on fancy coffee

00:00:49.228 --> 00:00:51.656
and I saw our household budget explode.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.681
(Laughter)

00:00:52.705 --> 00:00:53.855
And worse ...

00:00:55.038 --> 00:00:58.140
I also feared that this investment
would be in vain.

00:00:58.164 --> 00:01:01.680
That we wouldn't be able to notice
this difference after all.

00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:07.188
Unfortunately, especially for my husband,

00:01:07.212 --> 00:01:10.332
he had momentarily forgotten
that he's married to a neuroscientist

00:01:10.356 --> 00:01:12.141
with a specialty in food science.

00:01:12.165 --> 00:01:13.339
(Laughter)

00:01:13.363 --> 00:01:14.536
Alright?

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.187
So without further ado,

00:01:16.211 --> 00:01:18.428
I mean, I just put him to the test.

00:01:19.126 --> 00:01:21.087
I set up an experiment

00:01:21.111 --> 00:01:23.996
where I first blindfolded my husband.

00:01:24.475 --> 00:01:25.626
(Laughter)

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.101
Then I brewed the two types of coffee

00:01:29.125 --> 00:01:31.705
and I told him that
I would serve them to him

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.069
one at a time.

00:01:34.387 --> 00:01:36.236
Now, with clear certainty,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.678
my husband, he described
the first cup of coffee

00:01:38.702 --> 00:01:39.998
as more raw and bitter.

00:01:40.022 --> 00:01:42.752
You know, a coffee
that would be ideal for the mornings

00:01:42.776 --> 00:01:46.747
with the sole purpose of terrorizing
the body awake by its alarming taste.

00:01:46.771 --> 00:01:48.874
(Laughter)

00:01:48.898 --> 00:01:51.762
The second cup of coffee,
on the other hand,

00:01:51.786 --> 00:01:55.577
was both fruity and delightful.

00:01:55.601 --> 00:01:59.668
You know, coffee that one
can enjoy in the evening and relax.

00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:04.299
Little did my husband know, however,

00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:07.648
that I hadn't actually given him
the two types of coffee.

00:02:07.672 --> 00:02:10.810
I had given him the exact same
cup of coffee twice.

00:02:10.834 --> 00:02:13.001
(Laughter)

00:02:13.358 --> 00:02:15.992
And obviously, it wasn't
this one cup of coffee

00:02:16.016 --> 00:02:18.960
that had suddenly gone
from horrible to fantastic.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.137
No, this taste difference
was a product of my husband's own mind.

00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:26.528
Of his bias in favor of the fancy coffee

00:02:26.552 --> 00:02:29.941
that made him experience taste differences
that just weren't there.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.341
Alright, so, having saved
our household budget,

00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:38.048
and finishing on a very good laugh,

00:02:38.072 --> 00:02:39.247
me especially --

00:02:39.271 --> 00:02:40.278
(Laughter)

00:02:40.302 --> 00:02:43.268
I then started wondering
just how we could have received

00:02:43.292 --> 00:02:46.894
two such different responses
from a single cup of coffee.

00:02:47.331 --> 00:02:51.022
Why would my husband
make such a bold statement

00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:55.493
at the risk of being publicly mocked
for the rest of his life?

00:02:55.517 --> 00:02:57.350
(Laughter)

00:02:58.831 --> 00:03:03.172
The striking answer is
that I think you would have done the same.

00:03:03.196 --> 00:03:06.442
And that's the biggest challenge
in my field of science,

00:03:06.466 --> 00:03:09.776
assessing what's reality
behind these answers

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.966
that we receive.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.801
Because how are we
going to make food tastier

00:03:13.825 --> 00:03:17.419
if we cannot rely on what people
actually say they like?

00:03:18.728 --> 00:03:22.258
To understand, let's first have a look
at how we actually sense food.

00:03:22.923 --> 00:03:25.241
When I drink a cup of coffee,

00:03:25.265 --> 00:03:29.407
I detect this cup of coffee
by receptors on my body,

00:03:29.431 --> 00:03:33.878
information which is then turned
into activated neurons in my brain.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.300
Wavelengths of light
are converted to colors.

00:03:37.324 --> 00:03:41.459
Molecules in the liquid
are detected by receptors in my mouth,

00:03:41.483 --> 00:03:44.804
and categorized as one
of five basic tastes.

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:49.496
That's salty, sour,
bitter, sweet and umami.

00:03:50.433 --> 00:03:53.734
Molecules in the air
are detected by receptors in my nose

00:03:53.758 --> 00:03:55.292
and converted to odors.

00:03:55.704 --> 00:04:00.077
And ditto for touch, for temperature,
for sound and more.

00:04:00.394 --> 00:04:04.252
All this information is detected
by my receptors

00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:07.545
and converted into signals
between neurons in my brain.

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.456
Information which is then
woven together and integrated,

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.331
so that my brain recognizes

00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:21.112
that yes, I just had a cup of coffee,
and yes, I liked it.

00:04:21.763 --> 00:04:23.739
And only then,

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:26.747
after all this neuron heavy lifting,

00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:30.036
do we consciously experience
this cup of coffee.

00:04:30.988 --> 00:04:34.922
And this is now where we have
a very common misconception.

00:04:35.473 --> 00:04:39.004
People tend to think
that what we experience consciously

00:04:39.028 --> 00:04:42.218
must then be an absolute
true reflection of reality.

00:04:42.588 --> 00:04:44.302
But as you just heard,

00:04:44.326 --> 00:04:47.842
there are many stages
of neural interpretation

00:04:47.866 --> 00:04:52.371
in between the physical item
and the conscious experience of it.

00:04:52.395 --> 00:04:54.514
Which means that sometimes,

00:04:54.538 --> 00:04:58.341
this conscious experience is not really
reflecting that reality at all.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.920
Like what happened to my husband.

00:05:01.808 --> 00:05:05.950
That's because some physical stimuli
may just be so weak

00:05:05.974 --> 00:05:10.347
that they just can't break that barrier
to enter our conscious mind,

00:05:10.371 --> 00:05:12.253
while the information that does

00:05:12.277 --> 00:05:16.363
may get twisted on its way there
by our hidden biases.

00:05:16.824 --> 00:05:20.995
And people, they have a lot of biases.

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:26.181
Yes, if you're sitting there
right now, thinking ...

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.776
you could probably have done
better than my husband,

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.347
you could probably have assessed
those coffees correctly,

00:05:34.371 --> 00:05:37.180
then you're actually
suffering from a bias.

00:05:38.116 --> 00:05:40.585
A bias called the bias blind spot.

00:05:40.609 --> 00:05:45.415
Our tendency to see ourselves
as less biased than other people.

00:05:45.717 --> 00:05:46.907
(Laughter)

00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:48.424
And yeah, we can even be biased

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:50.415
about the biases that we're biased about.

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:51.440
(Laughter)

00:05:51.464 --> 00:05:53.588
Not trying to make this any easier.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.896
A bias that we know in the food industry
is the courtesy bias.

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:02.032
This is a bias where we give an opinion

00:06:02.056 --> 00:06:05.711
which is considered socially acceptable,

00:06:05.735 --> 00:06:08.400
but it's certainly not
our own opinion, right?

00:06:09.575 --> 00:06:12.130
And I'm challenged by this
as a food researcher,

00:06:12.154 --> 00:06:17.252
because when people say they like
my new sugar-reduced milkshake,

00:06:17.276 --> 00:06:18.458
do they now?

00:06:18.482 --> 00:06:19.537
(Laughter)

00:06:19.561 --> 00:06:21.910
Or are they saying they like it

00:06:21.934 --> 00:06:24.915
because they know I'm listening
and they want to please me?

00:06:25.544 --> 00:06:28.768
Or maybe they just to seem
fit and healthy in my ears.

00:06:30.115 --> 00:06:31.718
I wouldn't know.

00:06:31.742 --> 00:06:36.355
But worse, they wouldn't
even know themselves.

00:06:37.348 --> 00:06:38.705
Even trained food assessors,

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:41.300
and that's people who have been
explicitly taught

00:06:41.324 --> 00:06:45.451
to disentangle the sense of smell
and the sense of taste,

00:06:45.475 --> 00:06:48.582
may still be biased
to evaluate products sweeter

00:06:48.606 --> 00:06:50.139
if they contain vanilla.

00:06:50.455 --> 00:06:51.605
Why?

00:06:51.978 --> 00:06:55.128
Well, it's certainly not
because vanilla actually tastes sweet.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.466
It's because even these
professionals are human,

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.720
and have eaten lot of desserts, like us,

00:07:03.744 --> 00:07:07.239
and have therefore learned to associate
sweetness and vanilla.

00:07:08.056 --> 00:07:11.373
So taste and smell
and other sensory information

00:07:11.397 --> 00:07:14.484
is inextricably entangled
in our conscious mind.

00:07:14.508 --> 00:07:17.434
So on one hand, we can actually use this.

00:07:17.458 --> 00:07:19.927
We can use these conscious experiences,

00:07:19.951 --> 00:07:24.220
use this data, exploit it
by adding vanilla instead of sugar

00:07:24.244 --> 00:07:25.844
to sweeten our products.

00:07:26.823 --> 00:07:29.149
But on the other hand,

00:07:29.173 --> 00:07:30.760
with these conscious evaluations,

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:31.982
I still wouldn't know

00:07:32.006 --> 00:07:34.871
whether people actually liked
that sugar-reduced milkshake.

00:07:36.006 --> 00:07:37.791
So how do we get around this problem?

00:07:37.815 --> 00:07:40.077
How do we actually assess what's reality

00:07:40.101 --> 00:07:42.736
behind these conscious food evaluations?

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.935
The key is to remove the barrier
of the conscious mind

00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:50.231
and instead target the information
in the brain directly.

00:07:51.015 --> 00:07:52.316
And it turns out

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.407
our brain holds a lot
of fascinating secrets.

00:07:55.872 --> 00:08:00.940
Our brain constantly receives
sensory information from our entire body,

00:08:00.964 --> 00:08:03.321
most of which we don't even
become aware of,

00:08:03.345 --> 00:08:06.265
like the taste information
that I constantly receive

00:08:06.289 --> 00:08:08.158
from my gastrointestinal tract.

00:08:08.647 --> 00:08:12.718
And my brain will also act
on all this sensory information.

00:08:13.274 --> 00:08:16.710
It will alter my behavior
without my knowledge,

00:08:16.734 --> 00:08:19.990
and it can increase
the diameter of my pupils

00:08:20.014 --> 00:08:21.974
if I experience something I really like.

00:08:22.355 --> 00:08:25.410
And increase my sweat production
ever so slightly

00:08:25.434 --> 00:08:27.301
if that emotion was intense.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.990
And with brain scans,

00:08:30.014 --> 00:08:33.280
we can now assess
this information in the brain.

00:08:34.021 --> 00:08:36.469
Specifically, I have used
a brain-scanning technique

00:08:36.493 --> 00:08:38.846
called electroencephalography,

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.703
or "EEG" in short,

00:08:40.727 --> 00:08:44.672
which involves wearing a cap
studded with electrodes,

00:08:44.696 --> 00:08:47.164
128 in my case.

00:08:47.957 --> 00:08:51.568
Each electrode then measures
the electrical activity of the brain

00:08:51.592 --> 00:08:54.193
with precision down to the millisecond.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.680
The problem is, however,

00:08:57.704 --> 00:09:00.133
it's not just the brain
that's electrically active,

00:09:00.157 --> 00:09:02.895
it's also the rest of the body
as well as the environment

00:09:02.919 --> 00:09:05.633
that contains a lot
of electrical activity all the time.

00:09:05.657 --> 00:09:07.045
To do my research,

00:09:07.069 --> 00:09:10.069
I therefore need
to minimize all this noise.

00:09:10.411 --> 00:09:13.894
So I ask my participants
to do a number of things here.

00:09:14.427 --> 00:09:15.586
First off,

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:18.915
I ask them to rest their head
in a chin rest,

00:09:18.939 --> 00:09:21.360
to avoid too much muscle movement.

00:09:21.384 --> 00:09:25.379
I also ask them to, meanwhile,
stare at the center of a computer monitor

00:09:25.403 --> 00:09:28.172
to avoid too much
eye movements and eye blinks.

00:09:28.196 --> 00:09:30.704
And I can't even have swallowing,

00:09:30.728 --> 00:09:35.320
so I ask my participants
to stick the tongue out of their mouth

00:09:35.344 --> 00:09:37.352
over a glass bowl,

00:09:37.376 --> 00:09:41.576
and then I constantly let
taste stimuli onto the tongue,

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.704
which then drip off into this bowl.

00:09:43.728 --> 00:09:45.212
(Laughter)

00:09:45.236 --> 00:09:49.379
And then, just to complete
this wonderful picture,

00:09:49.403 --> 00:09:51.990
I also provide my participants with a bib,

00:09:52.014 --> 00:09:55.117
available in either pink
or blue, as they please.

00:09:55.141 --> 00:09:59.228
(Laughter)

00:09:59.252 --> 00:10:01.366
Looks like a normal
eating experience, right?

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:02.540
(Laughter)

00:10:03.585 --> 00:10:05.005
No, obviously not.

00:10:06.546 --> 00:10:07.895
And worse,

00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:11.260
I can't even control
what my participants are thinking about,

00:10:11.284 --> 00:10:13.395
so I need to repeat this taste procedure

00:10:13.419 --> 00:10:14.569
multiple times.

00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.789
Maybe the first time,
they're thinking about the free lunch

00:10:17.813 --> 00:10:19.974
that I provide for participating,

00:10:19.998 --> 00:10:23.296
or maybe the second time,
they're thinking about Christmas coming up

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.220
and what to get for Mom
this year, you know.

00:10:27.109 --> 00:10:31.236
But common for each response
is the response to the taste.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.527
So I repeat this taste
procedure multiple times.

00:10:34.871 --> 00:10:36.720
Sixty, in fact.

00:10:37.291 --> 00:10:38.911
And then I average the responses,

00:10:38.935 --> 00:10:41.839
because responses unrelated
to taste will average out.

00:10:42.307 --> 00:10:43.958
And using this method,

00:10:43.982 --> 00:10:46.506
we and other labs,

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.033
have investigated how long a time
it takes from "food lands on our tongue"

00:10:50.057 --> 00:10:53.036
until our brain has figured out
which taste it's experiencing.

00:10:53.639 --> 00:10:56.853
Turns out this occurs within the first
already 100 milliseconds,

00:10:56.877 --> 00:10:59.853
that's about half a second
before we even become aware of it.

00:11:00.268 --> 00:11:02.080
And next up, we also investigated

00:11:02.104 --> 00:11:05.903
the taste difference between sugar
and artificial sweeteners

00:11:05.927 --> 00:11:08.203
that in our setup taste extremely similar.

00:11:08.563 --> 00:11:10.594
In fact, they tasted so similar

00:11:10.618 --> 00:11:14.197
that half my participants
could only barely tell the taste apart,

00:11:14.221 --> 00:11:16.546
while the other half simply couldn't.

00:11:17.015 --> 00:11:18.776
But amazingly,

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.926
if we looked across
the entire group of participants,

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:25.751
we saw that their brains
definitely could tell the taste apart.

00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:29.754
So with EEG and other
brain-scanning devices

00:11:29.778 --> 00:11:31.938
and other physiological measures --

00:11:31.962 --> 00:11:33.133
sweat and pupil size --

00:11:33.157 --> 00:11:35.172
we have new gateways to our brain.

00:11:35.625 --> 00:11:39.316
Gateways that will help us
remove the barrier of the conscious mind

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.523
to see through the biases of people

00:11:41.547 --> 00:11:44.327
and possibly even capture
subconscious taste differences.

00:11:44.689 --> 00:11:49.000
And that's because we can now measure
people's very first response to food

00:11:49.024 --> 00:11:50.841
before they've become conscious of it,

00:11:50.865 --> 00:11:54.031
and before they've started rationalizing
why they like it or not.

00:11:54.476 --> 00:11:56.651
We can measure people's
facial expressions,

00:11:56.675 --> 00:11:59.172
we can measure where they're looking,

00:11:59.196 --> 00:12:01.196
we can measure their sweat response,

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.620
we can measure their brain response.

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:06.093
And with all these measures,

00:12:06.117 --> 00:12:08.455
we are going to be able
to create tastier foods,

00:12:08.479 --> 00:12:10.876
because we can measure
whether people actually like

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.637
that sugar-reduced milkshake.

00:12:12.661 --> 00:12:16.764
And we can create healthier foods
without compromising taste,

00:12:16.788 --> 00:12:19.561
because we can measure the response
to different sweeteners

00:12:19.585 --> 00:12:22.688
and find the sweetener that gives
the response that's more similar

00:12:22.712 --> 00:12:24.005
to the response from sugar.

00:12:24.029 --> 00:12:26.704
And furthermore, we can just help
create healthier foods,

00:12:26.728 --> 00:12:29.695
because we can help understand
how we actually sense food

00:12:29.719 --> 00:12:30.986
in the first place.

00:12:31.533 --> 00:12:34.200
Which we know surprisingly little about.

00:12:34.589 --> 00:12:37.920
For example, we know
that there are those five basic tastes,

00:12:37.944 --> 00:12:40.187
but we strongly suspect
that there are more,

00:12:40.211 --> 00:12:45.188
and in fact, using our EEG setup,
we found evidence that fat,

00:12:45.212 --> 00:12:47.799
besides being sensed
by its texture and smell,

00:12:47.823 --> 00:12:49.092
is also tasted.

00:12:49.553 --> 00:12:52.934
Meaning that fat could be
this new sixth basic taste.

00:12:53.522 --> 00:12:57.879
And if we figure out
how our brain recognizes fat and sugar,

00:12:57.903 --> 00:12:59.220
and I'm just dreaming here,

00:12:59.244 --> 00:13:00.736
but could we then one day

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.798
create a milkshake with zero calories
that tastes just like the real deal?

00:13:06.894 --> 00:13:09.172
Or maybe we figure out that we can't,

00:13:09.196 --> 00:13:11.766
because we subconsciously detect calories

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:14.574
via our receptors
in our gastrointestinal tract.

00:13:15.137 --> 00:13:16.537
The future will show.

00:13:17.978 --> 00:13:20.803
Our conscious experience of food

00:13:20.827 --> 00:13:25.791
is just the tip of the iceberg
of our total sensation of food.

00:13:25.815 --> 00:13:28.122
And by studying this total sensation,

00:13:28.146 --> 00:13:31.022
conscious and subconscious alike,

00:13:31.046 --> 00:13:35.555
I truly believe that we can make
tastier and healthier foods for all.

00:13:35.579 --> 00:13:36.730
Thank you.

00:13:36.754 --> 00:13:41.920
(Applause)
