00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.176
Probably not a surprise to you,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.336
but I don't like to be in a hospital

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.016
or go to a hospital.

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.816
Do you?

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.296
I'm sure many of you
feel the same way, right?

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.335
But why? Why is it
that we hate hospitals so much?

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.720
Or is it just a fact of life
we have to live with?

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.440
Is it the crappy food?

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.536
Is it the expensive parking?

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.336
Is it the intense smell?

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.240
Or is it the fear of the unknown?

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.040
Well, it's all of that, and it's more.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.656
Patients often have
to travel long distances

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.280
to get to their nearest hospital,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.256
and access to hospital care
is becoming more and more an issue

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.936
in rural areas,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.256
in the US,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.080
but also in sparsely populated
countries like Sweden.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.120
And even when hospitals are more abundant,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.056
typically the poor and the elderly

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.136
have trouble getting care
because they lack transportation

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.600
that is convenient and affordable to them.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.376
And many people are avoiding
hospital care altogether,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.416
and they miss getting proper treatment

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.640
due to cost.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.416
We see that 64 percent of Americans

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.000
are avoiding care due to cost.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.816
And even when you do get treatment,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.920
hospitals often make us sicker.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.080
Medical errors are reported to be
the third cause of death in the US,

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.536
just behind cancer and heart disease,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.040
the third cause of death.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.776
I'm in health care for over 20 years now,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.480
and I witness every day how broken
and how obsolete our hospital system is.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.176
Let me give you two examples.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.456
Four in 10 Japanese medical doctors

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.296
and five in 10 American medical doctors

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.520
are burnt out.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.976
In my home country, the Netherlands,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.176
only 17 million people live there.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.960
We are short 125,000 nurses
over the coming years.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.656
But how did we even end up here,

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.496
in this idea of placing
all kinds of sick people

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.200
together in one big building?

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.400
Well, we have to go back
to the Ancient Greeks.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.336
In 400 BC, temples for cure were erected

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.856
where people could go
to get their diagnosis,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.336
their treatment and their healing.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.776
And then really for about 2,000 years,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.296
we've seen religious care centers

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.896
all the way up
to the Industrial Revolution,

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.080
where we've seen hospitals
being set up as assembly lines

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.496
based on the principles
of the Industrial Revolution,

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.976
to produce efficiently

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.736
and get the products,
the patients in this case,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.120
out of the hospital as soon as possible.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.816
Over the last century, we've seen
lots of interesting innovations.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.296
We figured out how to make insulin.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.096
We invented pacemakers and X-ray,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.720
and we even came into this wonderful
new era of cell and gene therapies.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.296
But the biggest change
to fix our hospital system altogether

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.336
is still ahead of us.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.216
And I believe it's time now,
we have the opportunity,

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.296
to revolutionize the system altogether

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.096
and forget about
our current hospital system.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.336
I believe it's time to create a new system

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.920
that revolves around health care at home.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.416
Recent research has shown

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.696
that 46 percent of hospital care

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.240
can move to the patient's home.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.176
That's a lot.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.536
And that's mainly for those patients
who suffer from chronic diseases.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.536
With that, hospitals can and should

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.496
reduce to smaller,
agile and mobile care centers

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.800
focused on acute care.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.936
So things like neonatology,
intensive care, surgery and imaging

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.016
will still remain at the hospitals,

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.800
at least I believe
for the foreseeable future.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.576
A few weeks ago, I met a colleague

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.856
whose mom was diagnosed
with incurable cancer,

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.696
and she said, "Niels, it's hard.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.480
It's so hard when we know
that she's got only months to live.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.616
Instead of playing with the grandchildren,

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.136
she now has to travel three times a week

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.136
two hours up and down to Amsterdam

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.080
just to get her treatment and tests."

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.576
And that really breaks my heart,

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.096
because we all know
that a professional nurse

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.696
could draw her blood
at home as well, right?

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.336
And if she could get her tests
and treatment at home as well,

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.736
she could do the things
that are really important to her

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.360
in her last months.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.920
My own mom, 82 years old now --
God bless her --

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.576
she's avoiding to go to the hospital

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.536
because she finds it difficult
to plan and manage the journey.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.536
So my sisters and I, we help her out.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.776
But there's many elderly people
who are avoiding care

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.216
and are waiting that long
that it becomes life-threatening,

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.920
and it's straight
to the costly, intensive care.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.096
Dr. Covinsky, a clinical researcher
at the University of California,

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.656
he concludes that a third
of patients over 70

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.776
and more than half of patients over 85,

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.840
leave the hospital more disabled
than when they came in.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.896
And a very practical problem

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.376
that many patients face
when they have to go to a hospital is:

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.936
Where do I go with my main
companion in life,

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.600
where do I go with my dog?

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.296
That's our dog, by the way.
Isn't she cute?

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.960
(Laughter)

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.856
But it's not only about convenience.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.000
It's also about unnecessary
health care stays and costs.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.256
A friend of mine, Art,

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.096
he recently needed to be hospitalized
for just a minor surgery,

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.856
and he had to stay in the hospital
for over two weeks,

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.816
just because he needed
a specific kind of IV antibiotics.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.016
So he occupied a bed for two weeks

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.816
that cost over a thousand euros a day.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.816
It's just ridiculous.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.856
And these costs are really
at the heart of the issue.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.136
So we've seen over many
of our global economies,

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.336
health care expense grow
as a percentage of GDP

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.056
over the last years.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.016
So here we see
that over the last 50 years,

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.056
health care expense has grown
from about five percent in Germany

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.920
to about 11 percent now.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.960
In the US, we've seen growth
from six percent to over 17 percent now.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.136
And a large portion of these costs
are driven by investments

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.920
in large, shiny hospital buildings.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.536
And these buildings are not flexible,

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.696
and they maintain a system
where hospital beds need to be filled

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.360
for a hospital to run efficiently.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.680
There's no incentive
for a hospital to run with less beds.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.080
Just the thought of that
makes you sick, right?

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.696
And here's the thing: the cost
for treating my buddy Art at home

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.960
can be up to 10 times cheaper
than hospital care.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.720
And that is where we're headed.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.840
The hospital bed of the future
will be in our own homes.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.576
And it's already starting.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.616
Global home care is growing
10 percent year over year.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.216
And from my own experience,
I see that logistics and technology

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.720
are making these home
health care solutions work.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.536
Technology is already
allowing us to do things

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.600
that were once exclusive to hospitals.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.400
Diagnosis tests like blood,

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:01.056
glucose tests, urine tests, can now
be taken in the comfort of our homes.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.800
And more and more connected devices

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.096
we see like pacemakers and insulin pumps

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.760
that will proactively signal
if help is needed soon.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.896
And all that technology is coming together

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.216
in much more insights
into the patients' health,

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.256
and that insight and all of
the information leads to better control

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.336
and to less medical errors --

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.136
remember, the third cause of death

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.360
in the US.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.336
And I see it every day at work.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.056
I work in logistics

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.560
and for me, home health care works.

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:42.176
So we see a delivery driver
deliver the medicine

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.400
to the patient's home.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.936
A nurse joins him
and actually administers the drug

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.159
at the patient's home.

00:08:50.679 --> 00:08:52.376
It's that simple.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.015
Remember my buddy, Art?

00:08:54.039 --> 00:08:57.816
He can now get the IV antibiotics
in the comfort of his home:

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.576
no hospital pajamas, no crappy food

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.456
and no risk of these
antibiotic-resistant superbugs

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.856
that only bite you in these hospitals.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.136
And it goes further.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.656
So now the elderly people
can get the treatment that they need

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.656
in the comfort of their own home

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.176
while with their best companion in life.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.536
And there's no need anymore
to drive hours and hours

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.440
just to get your treatment and tests.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.216
In the Netherlands and in Denmark,

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.936
we've seen very good successes
in cancer clinics

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.120
organizing chemotherapies
at the patient's homes,

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.680
sometimes even together
with fellow patients.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.616
The best improvements for these patients

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.136
have been improvements
in reduction in stress,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.720
anxiety disorders and depression.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.576
Home health care also helped them
to get back a sense of normality

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.936
and freedom in their lives,

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:58.000
and they've actually helped them
to forget about their disease.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.216
But home health care, Niels --

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.136
what if I don't even have a home,
when I'm homeless,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.536
or when I do have a home
but there's no one to take care of me

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.240
or even open up the door?

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.416
Well, in comes our sharing economy,

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.336
or, as I like to call it,
the Airbnb for home care.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.696
In the Netherlands,
we see churches and care organizations

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.576
match people in need of care and company

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.736
with people who actually
have a home for them

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.720
and can provide care and company to them.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.416
Home health care is cheaper,

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:36.056
it's easier to facilitate,
and it's quick to set up --

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.656
in these rural areas we talked about,
but also in humanitarian crisis situations

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:46.360
where it's often safer, quicker
and cheaper to set things up at home.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.296
Home health care is very applicable
in prosperous areas

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.896
but also very much
in underserved communities.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.056
Home health care
works in developed countries

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.800
as well as in developing countries.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:06.576
So I'm passionate to help facilitate
improvements in patients' lives

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.536
due to home health care.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.976
I'm passionate to help facilitate

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.736
that the elderly people
get the treatment that they need

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.496
in the comfort of their own homes,

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.560
together with their
best companion in life.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.136
I'm passionate to make the change

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.736
and help ensure that patients,
and not their disease,

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.320
are in control of their lives.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.976
To me, that is health care
delivered at home.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.216
Thank you.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:35.000
