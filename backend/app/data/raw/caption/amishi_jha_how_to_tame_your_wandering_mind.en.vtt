00:00:14.372 --> 00:00:16.603
Consider the following statement:

00:00:16.627 --> 00:00:20.494
human beings only use 10 percent
of their brain capacity.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.529
Well, as a neuroscientist, I can tell you

00:00:23.553 --> 00:00:25.656
that while Morgan Freeman
delivered this line

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.656
with the gravitas
that makes him a great actor,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.957
this statement is entirely false.

00:00:30.981 --> 00:00:32.061
(Laughter)

00:00:32.085 --> 00:00:36.770
The truth is, human beings use 100 percent
of their brain capacity.

00:00:37.348 --> 00:00:40.903
The brain is a highly efficient,
energy-demanding organ

00:00:40.927 --> 00:00:43.149
that gets fully utilized

00:00:43.173 --> 00:00:47.664
and even though it is
at full capacity being used,

00:00:47.688 --> 00:00:50.172
it suffers from a problem
of information overload.

00:00:50.196 --> 00:00:53.761
There's far too much in the environment
than it can fully process.

00:00:53.785 --> 00:00:56.873
So to solve this problem of overload,

00:00:56.897 --> 00:00:58.857
evolution devised a solution,

00:00:58.881 --> 00:01:00.864
which is the brain's attention system.

00:01:01.332 --> 00:01:03.418
Attention allows us

00:01:03.442 --> 00:01:07.958
to notice, select and direct
the brain's computational resources

00:01:07.982 --> 00:01:10.382
to a subset of all that's available.

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.402
We can think of attention
as the leader of the brain.

00:01:13.871 --> 00:01:16.910
Wherever attention goes,
the rest of the brain follows.

00:01:16.934 --> 00:01:19.468
In some sense, it's your brain's boss.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:21.479
And over the last 15 years,

00:01:21.503 --> 00:01:24.042
I've been studying
the human brain's attention system.

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:27.434
In all of our studies,
I've been very interested in one question.

00:01:28.037 --> 00:01:32.093
If it is indeed the case
that our attention is the brain's boss,

00:01:32.117 --> 00:01:33.410
is it a good boss?

00:01:33.434 --> 00:01:35.501
Does it actually guide us well?

00:01:36.244 --> 00:01:39.871
And to dig in on this big question,
I wanted to know three things.

00:01:39.895 --> 00:01:43.862
First, how does attention
control our perception?

00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:46.633
Second, why does it fail us,

00:01:46.657 --> 00:01:49.917
often leaving us feeling
foggy and distracted?

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.752
And third, can we do anything
about this fogginess,

00:01:53.776 --> 00:01:56.954
can we train our brain
to pay better attention?

00:01:57.312 --> 00:02:02.546
To have more strong and stable attention
in the work that we do in our lives.

00:02:03.593 --> 00:02:07.268
So I wanted to give you a brief glimpse

00:02:07.292 --> 00:02:09.109
into how we're going to look at this.

00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:11.111
A very poignant example

00:02:11.135 --> 00:02:14.093
of how our attention
ends up getting utilized.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.951
And I want to do it using the example
of somebody that I know quite well.

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:24.483
He ends up being part of a very large
group of people that we work with,

00:02:24.507 --> 00:02:27.045
for whom attention
is a matter of life and death.

00:02:27.571 --> 00:02:29.872
Think of medical professionals

00:02:29.896 --> 00:02:31.392
or firefighters

00:02:31.416 --> 00:02:33.837
or soldiers or marines.

00:02:34.173 --> 00:02:37.622
This is the story of a marine captain,
Captain Jeff Davis.

00:02:38.347 --> 00:02:41.315
And the scene that I'm going to share
with you, as you can see,

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:43.396
is not about his time in the battlefield.

00:02:43.744 --> 00:02:46.228
He was actually on a bridge, in Florida.

00:02:46.871 --> 00:02:49.259
But instead of looking
at the scenery around him,

00:02:49.283 --> 00:02:50.879
seeing the beautiful vistas

00:02:50.903 --> 00:02:53.466
and noticing the cool ocean breezes,

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.410
he was driving fast and contemplating
driving off that bridge.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.217
And he would later tell me that it took
all of everything he had not to do so.

00:03:03.685 --> 00:03:05.542
You see, he'd just returned from Iraq.

00:03:06.082 --> 00:03:08.121
And while his body was on that bridge,

00:03:08.145 --> 00:03:11.383
his mind, his attention,
was thousands of miles away.

00:03:11.407 --> 00:03:13.050
He was gripped with suffering.

00:03:13.736 --> 00:03:16.442
His mind was worried and preoccupied

00:03:16.466 --> 00:03:19.925
and had stressful memories
and, really, dread for his future.

00:03:20.862 --> 00:03:23.918
And I'm really glad
that he didn't take his life.

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.030
Because he, as a leader,
knew that he wasn't the only one

00:03:28.054 --> 00:03:29.458
that was probably suffering;

00:03:29.482 --> 00:03:31.656
many of his fellow marines
probably were, too.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.927
And in the year 2008, he partnered with me
in the first-of-its-kind project

00:03:36.951 --> 00:03:41.545
that actually allowed us to test and offer
something called mindfulness training

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.561
to active-duty military personnel.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.246
But before I tell you about
what mindfulness training is,

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.983
or the results of that study,

00:03:49.007 --> 00:03:52.648
I think it's important to understand
how attention works in the brain.

00:03:54.395 --> 00:03:56.220
So what we do in the laboratory

00:03:56.244 --> 00:04:00.553
is that many of our studies of attention
involve brain-wave recordings.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.196
In these brain wave recordings,
people wear funny-looking caps

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.966
that are sort of like swimming caps,
that have electrodes embedded in them.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.601
These electrodes pick up
the ongoing brain electrical activity.

00:04:12.117 --> 00:04:14.823
And they do it with millisecond
temporal precision.

00:04:15.268 --> 00:04:19.942
So we can see these small yet detectable
voltage fluctuations over time.

00:04:20.929 --> 00:04:26.325
And doing this, we can very precisely
plot the timing of the brain's activity.

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:29.726
About 170 milliseconds

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.260
after we show our research participants
a face on the screen,

00:04:33.284 --> 00:04:37.006
we see a very reliable,
detectable brain signature.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.418
It happens right at the back of the scalp,

00:04:39.442 --> 00:04:42.648
above the regions of the brain
that are involved in face processing.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.355
Now, this happens so reliably
and so on cue,

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:49.338
as the brain's face detector,

00:04:49.362 --> 00:04:51.943
that we've even given
this brain-wave component a name.

00:04:51.967 --> 00:04:54.015
We call it the N170 component.

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:57.211
And we use this component
in many of our studies.

00:04:57.235 --> 00:05:02.279
It allows us to see the impact
that attention may have on our perception.

00:05:03.022 --> 00:05:05.729
I'm going to give you a sense
of the kind of experiments

00:05:05.753 --> 00:05:07.252
that we actually do in the lab.

00:05:07.276 --> 00:05:09.871
We would show participants
images like this one.

00:05:09.895 --> 00:05:13.553
You should see a face and a scene
overlaid on each other.

00:05:14.037 --> 00:05:16.116
And what we do is we ask our participants

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.863
as they're viewing a series
of these types of overlaid images,

00:05:19.887 --> 00:05:21.726
to do something with their attention.

00:05:22.212 --> 00:05:25.127
On some trials, we'll ask them
to pay attention to the face.

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.578
And to make sure they're doing that,

00:05:27.602 --> 00:05:30.180
we ask them to tell us,
by pressing a button,

00:05:30.204 --> 00:05:32.516
if the face appeared to be male or female.

00:05:33.046 --> 00:05:34.268
On other trials,

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:38.090
we ask them to tell what the scene was --
was it indoor or outdoor?

00:05:38.704 --> 00:05:40.768
And in this way,
we can manipulate attention

00:05:40.792 --> 00:05:43.974
and confirm that the participants
were actually doing what we said.

00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:47.952
Our hypotheses about attention
were as follows:

00:05:49.014 --> 00:05:53.371
if attention is indeed doing its job
and affecting perception,

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:55.595
maybe it works like an amplifier.

00:05:56.252 --> 00:05:57.427
And what I mean by this

00:05:57.451 --> 00:05:59.650
is that when we direct
attention to the face,

00:05:59.674 --> 00:06:02.302
it becomes clearer and more salient,

00:06:02.326 --> 00:06:03.946
it's easier to see.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.923
But when we direct it to the scene,
the face becomes barely perceptible

00:06:07.947 --> 00:06:09.978
as we process the scene information.

00:06:10.823 --> 00:06:12.037
So what we wanted to do

00:06:12.061 --> 00:06:16.155
is look at this brain-wave component
of face detection, the N170,

00:06:16.179 --> 00:06:18.205
and see if it changed at all

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:21.237
as a function of where our participants
were paying attention --

00:06:21.261 --> 00:06:22.700
to the scene or the face.

00:06:23.323 --> 00:06:24.569
And here's what we found.

00:06:24.974 --> 00:06:27.411
We found that when they paid
attention to the face,

00:06:27.435 --> 00:06:28.954
the N170 was larger.

00:06:29.276 --> 00:06:33.117
And when they paid attention to the scene,
as you can see in red, it was smaller.

00:06:33.141 --> 00:06:35.772
And that gap you see
between the blue and red lines

00:06:35.796 --> 00:06:37.036
is pretty powerful.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.006
What it tells us is that attention,

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.114
which is really the only
thing that changed,

00:06:41.138 --> 00:06:43.948
since the images they viewed
were identical in both cases --

00:06:43.972 --> 00:06:45.759
attention changes perception.

00:06:45.783 --> 00:06:47.727
And it does so very fast.

00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:50.894
Within 170 milliseconds
of actually seeing a face.

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:54.800
In our follow-up studies,
we wanted to see what would happen,

00:06:54.824 --> 00:06:57.204
how could we perturb
or diminish this effect.

00:06:57.775 --> 00:07:02.323
And our hunch was that if you put people
in a very stressful environment,

00:07:02.347 --> 00:07:05.236
if you distract them with disturbing,
negative images,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.855
images of suffering and violence --

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:10.801
sort of like what you might see
on the news, unfortunately --

00:07:10.825 --> 00:07:13.383
that doing this might
actually affect their attention.

00:07:13.407 --> 00:07:15.029
And that's indeed what we found.

00:07:15.053 --> 00:07:18.212
If we present stressful images
while they're doing this experiment,

00:07:18.236 --> 00:07:21.887
this gap of attention shrinks,
its power diminishes.

00:07:22.506 --> 00:07:24.840
So in some of our other studies,

00:07:24.864 --> 00:07:26.373
we wanted to see, OK, great --

00:07:26.397 --> 00:07:29.540
not great, actually, bad news
that stress does this to the brain --

00:07:29.564 --> 00:07:33.569
but if it is the case that stress
has this powerful influence on attention

00:07:33.593 --> 00:07:35.466
through external distraction,

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.498
what if we don't need
external distraction,

00:07:37.522 --> 00:07:39.411
what if we distract ourselves?

00:07:39.435 --> 00:07:40.744
And to do this,

00:07:40.768 --> 00:07:42.927
we had to basically come up
with an experiment

00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:46.474
in which we could have people
generate their own mind-wandering.

00:07:46.498 --> 00:07:48.323
This is having off-task thoughts

00:07:48.347 --> 00:07:51.881
while we're engaged
in an ongoing task of some sort.

00:07:52.657 --> 00:07:56.571
And the trick to mind-wandering
is that essentially, you bore people.

00:07:56.879 --> 00:08:00.371
So hopefully there's not a lot
of mind-wandering happening right now.

00:08:00.395 --> 00:08:01.712
When we bore people,

00:08:01.736 --> 00:08:06.370
people happily generate all kinds
of internal content to occupy themselves.

00:08:06.394 --> 00:08:08.220
So we devised what might be considered

00:08:08.244 --> 00:08:10.244
one of the world's
most boring experiments.

00:08:10.268 --> 00:08:13.315
All the participants saw
were a series of faces on the screen,

00:08:13.339 --> 00:08:14.537
one after another.

00:08:14.561 --> 00:08:17.054
They pressed the button
every time they saw the face.

00:08:17.078 --> 00:08:18.229
That was pretty much it.

00:08:18.253 --> 00:08:21.603
Well, one trick was that sometimes,
the face would be upside down,

00:08:21.627 --> 00:08:23.469
and it would happen very infrequently.

00:08:23.493 --> 00:08:26.389
On those trials they were told
just to withhold the response.

00:08:26.752 --> 00:08:30.038
Pretty soon, we could tell that
they were successfully mind-wandering,

00:08:30.062 --> 00:08:33.031
because they pressed the button
when that face was upside down.

00:08:33.055 --> 00:08:35.913
Even though it's quite plain to see
that it was upside down.

00:08:35.937 --> 00:08:39.106
So we wanted to know what happens
when people have mind-wandering.

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.184
And what we found was that,

00:08:41.208 --> 00:08:43.050
very similar to external stress

00:08:43.074 --> 00:08:45.525
and external distraction
in the environment,

00:08:45.549 --> 00:08:48.537
internal distraction,
our own mind wandering,

00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:50.933
also shrinks the gap of attention.

00:08:50.957 --> 00:08:53.092
It diminishes attention's power.

00:08:54.149 --> 00:08:56.394
So what do all of these studies tell us?

00:08:56.895 --> 00:08:59.507
They tell us that attention
is very powerful

00:08:59.531 --> 00:09:01.632
in terms of affecting our perception.

00:09:02.323 --> 00:09:05.585
Even though it's so powerful,
it's also fragile and vulnerable.

00:09:06.038 --> 00:09:09.760
And things like stress
and mind-wandering diminish its power.

00:09:10.243 --> 00:09:13.788
But that's all in the context of these
very controlled laboratory settings.

00:09:13.812 --> 00:09:15.233
What about in the real world?

00:09:15.257 --> 00:09:17.306
What about in our actual day-to-day life?

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:18.480
What about now?

00:09:18.855 --> 00:09:20.799
Where is your attention right now?

00:09:21.196 --> 00:09:22.403
To kind of bring it back,

00:09:22.427 --> 00:09:24.783
I'd like to make a prediction
about your attention

00:09:24.807 --> 00:09:26.252
for the remainder of my talk.

00:09:26.276 --> 00:09:27.744
Are you up for it?

00:09:27.768 --> 00:09:29.450
Here's the prediction.

00:09:29.474 --> 00:09:33.703
You will be unaware of what I'm saying
for four out of the next eight minutes.

00:09:33.727 --> 00:09:34.728
(Laughter)

00:09:34.752 --> 00:09:37.450
It's a challenge,
so pay attention, please.

00:09:37.474 --> 00:09:39.759
Now, why am I saying this?

00:09:40.577 --> 00:09:44.275
I'm surely going to assume
that you're going to remain seated

00:09:44.299 --> 00:09:47.173
and, you know, graciously keep
your eyes on me as I speak.

00:09:47.665 --> 00:09:52.180
But a growing body of literature suggests
that we mind-wander,

00:09:52.204 --> 00:09:54.506
we take our mind away
from the task at hand,

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:57.130
about 50 percent of our waking moments.

00:09:57.625 --> 00:10:00.387
These might be small,
little trips that we take away,

00:10:00.411 --> 00:10:01.934
private thoughts that we have.

00:10:02.649 --> 00:10:05.268
And when this mind-wandering happens,

00:10:05.292 --> 00:10:06.466
it can be problematic.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.987
Now I don't think there will be
any dire consequences

00:10:09.011 --> 00:10:10.576
with you all sitting here today,

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.140
but imagine a military leader missing
four minutes of a military briefing,

00:10:14.164 --> 00:10:18.470
or a judge missing
four minutes of testimony.

00:10:18.494 --> 00:10:20.654
Or a surgeon or firefighter
missing any time.

00:10:20.678 --> 00:10:23.217
The consequences
in those cases could be dire.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.934
So we might ask why do we do this?

00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.667
Why do we mind-wander so much?

00:10:27.691 --> 00:10:33.518
Well, part of the answer is that our mind
is an exquisite time-traveling master.

00:10:34.079 --> 00:10:36.045
It can actually time travel very easily.

00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:39.553
If we think of the mind as the metaphor
of the music player, we see this.

00:10:39.577 --> 00:10:41.332
We can rewind the mind to the past

00:10:41.356 --> 00:10:44.048
to reflect on events
that have already happened, right?

00:10:44.688 --> 00:10:48.468
Or we can go and fast-future, to plan
for the next thing that we want to do.

00:10:49.021 --> 00:10:53.561
And we land in this mental
time-travel mode of the past or the future

00:10:53.585 --> 00:10:54.823
very frequently.

00:10:54.847 --> 00:10:57.212
And we land there often
without our awareness,

00:10:57.236 --> 00:10:58.871
most times without our awareness,

00:10:58.895 --> 00:11:00.760
even if we want to be paying attention.

00:11:00.784 --> 00:11:03.553
Think of just the last time
you were trying to read a book,

00:11:03.577 --> 00:11:06.893
got to the bottom of the page
with no idea what the words were saying.

00:11:06.917 --> 00:11:08.184
This happens to us.

00:11:08.782 --> 00:11:14.679
And when this happens, when we mind-wander
without an awareness that we're doing it,

00:11:14.703 --> 00:11:16.488
there are consequences.

00:11:16.512 --> 00:11:17.662
We make errors.

00:11:18.135 --> 00:11:20.468
We miss critical information, sometimes.

00:11:20.912 --> 00:11:23.306
And we have difficulty making decisions.

00:11:24.492 --> 00:11:27.555
What's worse is when we experience stress.

00:11:28.061 --> 00:11:30.482
When we're in a moment of overwhelm.

00:11:30.506 --> 00:11:33.776
We don't just reflect
on the past when we rewind,

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:38.394
we end up being in the past
ruminating, reliving or regretting

00:11:38.418 --> 00:11:40.077
events that have already happened.

00:11:40.506 --> 00:11:43.227
Or under stress, we fast-forward the mind.

00:11:43.251 --> 00:11:45.497
Not just to productively plan.

00:11:45.521 --> 00:11:47.582
But we end up catastrophizing or worrying

00:11:47.606 --> 00:11:49.601
about events that haven't happened yet

00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:51.283
and frankly may never happen.

00:11:51.307 --> 00:11:54.918
So at this point, you might be
thinking to yourself, OK,

00:11:54.942 --> 00:11:57.196
mind-wandering's happening a lot.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.695
Often, it happens without our awareness.

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:01.940
And under stress, it's even worse --

00:12:01.964 --> 00:12:04.410
we mind-wander more powerfully
and more often.

00:12:04.434 --> 00:12:06.720
Is there anything
we can possibly do about this?

00:12:07.306 --> 00:12:09.712
And I'm happy to say the answer is yes.

00:12:10.292 --> 00:12:11.736
From our work, we're learning

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.666
that the opposite of a stressed
and wandering mind is a mindful one.

00:12:17.387 --> 00:12:20.037
Mindfulness has to do
with paying attention

00:12:20.061 --> 00:12:23.252
to our present-moment experience
with awareness.

00:12:23.553 --> 00:12:27.119
And without any kind of emotional
reactivity of what's happening.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.089
It's about keeping
that button right on play

00:12:30.113 --> 00:12:33.144
to experience the moment-to-moment
unfolding of our lives.

00:12:33.863 --> 00:12:36.632
And mindfulness is not just a concept.

00:12:36.656 --> 00:12:38.736
It's more like practice,

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.950
you have to embody this mindful
mode of being to have any benefits.

00:12:42.974 --> 00:12:46.545
And a lot of the work that we're doing,
we're offering people programs

00:12:46.569 --> 00:12:49.776
that give our participants
a suite of exercises

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.428
that they should do daily

00:12:51.452 --> 00:12:54.956
in order to cultivate more moments
of mindfulness in their life.

00:12:55.895 --> 00:12:59.014
And for many of the groups
that we work with, high-stress groups,

00:12:59.038 --> 00:13:03.236
like I said -- soldiers,
medical professionals --

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:08.181
for them, as we know,
mind-wandering can be really dire.

00:13:08.895 --> 00:13:12.236
So we want to make sure
we offer them very accessible,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.196
low time constraints
to optimize the training,

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.775
so they can benefit from it.

00:13:17.434 --> 00:13:21.093
And when we do this, what we can do
is track to see what happens,

00:13:21.117 --> 00:13:22.735
not just in their regular lives

00:13:22.759 --> 00:13:26.467
but in the most demanding
circumstances that they may have.

00:13:26.491 --> 00:13:27.745
Why do we want to do this?

00:13:27.769 --> 00:13:31.451
Well, we want to, for example, give it
to students right around finals season.

00:13:31.475 --> 00:13:34.966
Or we want to give the training
to accountants during tax season.

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.299
Or soldiers and marines
while they're deploying.

00:13:37.631 --> 00:13:38.806
Why is that?

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:40.280
Because those are the moments

00:13:40.304 --> 00:13:42.987
in which their attention
is most likely to be vulnerable,

00:13:43.011 --> 00:13:45.688
because of stress and mind-wandering.

00:13:45.712 --> 00:13:47.175
And those are also the moments

00:13:47.199 --> 00:13:49.649
in which we want their attention
to be in peak shape

00:13:49.673 --> 00:13:51.322
so they can perform well.

00:13:51.346 --> 00:13:52.958
So what we do in our research

00:13:52.982 --> 00:13:55.589
is we have them take
a series of attention tests.

00:13:55.613 --> 00:13:59.340
We track their attention at the beginning
of some kind of high-stress interval,

00:13:59.364 --> 00:14:01.698
and then two months later,
we track them again,

00:14:01.722 --> 00:14:03.730
and we want to see
if there's a difference.

00:14:03.754 --> 00:14:06.603
Is there any benefit of offering them
mindfulness training?

00:14:06.627 --> 00:14:08.784
Can we protect against
the lapses in attention

00:14:08.808 --> 00:14:11.074
that might arise over high stress?

00:14:12.244 --> 00:14:13.768
So here's what we find.

00:14:13.792 --> 00:14:15.205
Over a high-stress interval,

00:14:15.229 --> 00:14:18.107
unfortunately, the reality is
if we don't do anything at all,

00:14:18.131 --> 00:14:19.386
attention declines,

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:22.958
people are worse at the end
of this high-stress interval than before.

00:14:22.982 --> 00:14:27.037
But if we offer mindfulness training,
we can protect against this.

00:14:27.061 --> 00:14:30.102
They stay stable, even though
just like the other groups,

00:14:30.126 --> 00:14:31.802
they were experiencing high stress.

00:14:32.473 --> 00:14:34.290
And perhaps even more impressive

00:14:34.314 --> 00:14:36.401
is that if people
take our training programs

00:14:36.425 --> 00:14:38.077
over, let's say, eight weeks,

00:14:38.101 --> 00:14:41.859
and they fully commit
to doing the daily mindfulness exercises

00:14:41.883 --> 00:14:46.258
that allow them to learn
how to be in the present moment,

00:14:46.282 --> 00:14:50.314
well, they actually get better over time,
even though they're in high stress.

00:14:50.338 --> 00:14:52.815
And this last point
is actually important to realize,

00:14:52.839 --> 00:14:54.528
because of what it suggests to us

00:14:54.552 --> 00:14:58.863
is that mindfulness exercises
are very much like physical exercise:

00:14:58.887 --> 00:15:01.101
if you don't do it, you don't benefit.

00:15:01.125 --> 00:15:03.609
But if you do engage
in mindfulness practice,

00:15:03.633 --> 00:15:05.943
the more you do, the more you benefit.

00:15:07.176 --> 00:15:11.326
And I want to just bring it back
to Captain Jeff Davis.

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:13.359
As I mentioned to you at the beginning,

00:15:13.383 --> 00:15:15.895
his marines were involved
in the very first project

00:15:15.919 --> 00:15:19.109
that we ever did,
offering mindfulness training.

00:15:19.847 --> 00:15:22.752
And they showed this exact pattern,
which was very heartening.

00:15:22.776 --> 00:15:24.847
We had offered them
the mindfulness training

00:15:24.871 --> 00:15:27.196
right before they were deployed to Iraq.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.074
And upon their return,
Captain Davis shared with us

00:15:30.098 --> 00:15:33.410
what he was feeling
was the benefit of this program.

00:15:34.363 --> 00:15:37.240
He said that unlike last time,

00:15:37.264 --> 00:15:40.122
after this deployment,
they were much more present.

00:15:40.665 --> 00:15:42.149
They were discerning.

00:15:42.173 --> 00:15:43.939
They were not as reactive.

00:15:43.963 --> 00:15:46.488
And in some cases,
they were really more compassionate

00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:49.353
with the people they were
engaging with and each other.

00:15:49.377 --> 00:15:50.576
He said in many ways,

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.274
he felt that the mindfulness
training program we offered

00:15:53.298 --> 00:15:54.889
gave them a really important tool

00:15:54.913 --> 00:15:58.981
to protect against developing
post-traumatic stress disorder

00:15:59.005 --> 00:16:02.410
and even allowing it to turn
into post-traumatic growth.

00:16:02.434 --> 00:16:04.251
To us, this was very compelling.

00:16:05.458 --> 00:16:07.605
And it ended up
that Captain Davis and I --

00:16:07.629 --> 00:16:09.915
you know, this was about
a decade ago, in 2008 --

00:16:09.939 --> 00:16:11.819
we've kept in touch all these years.

00:16:12.268 --> 00:16:15.987
And he himself has gone on
to continue practicing mindfulness

00:16:16.011 --> 00:16:17.161
in a daily way.

00:16:17.748 --> 00:16:20.114
He was promoted to major,

00:16:20.138 --> 00:16:23.487
he actually then ended up retiring
from the Marine Corps.

00:16:23.511 --> 00:16:27.653
He went on to get a divorce,
to get remarried,

00:16:27.677 --> 00:16:29.460
to have a child, to get an MBA.

00:16:29.812 --> 00:16:34.290
And through all of these challenges
and transitions and joys of his life,

00:16:34.314 --> 00:16:36.631
he kept up with his mindfulness practice.

00:16:37.138 --> 00:16:41.154
And as fate would have it,
just a few months ago,

00:16:41.178 --> 00:16:45.709
Captain Davis suffered a massive
heart attack, at the age of 46.

00:16:46.717 --> 00:16:49.428
And he ended up calling me
a few weeks ago.

00:16:49.922 --> 00:16:52.620
And he said, "I want
to tell you something.

00:16:52.644 --> 00:16:56.858
I know that the doctors
who worked on me, they saved my heart,

00:16:56.882 --> 00:16:59.676
but mindfulness saved my life.

00:17:00.184 --> 00:17:03.092
The presence of mind I had
to stop the ambulance

00:17:03.116 --> 00:17:07.307
that ended up taking me
to the hospital," -- himself,

00:17:07.331 --> 00:17:12.177
the clarity of mind he had to notice
when there was fear and anxiety happening

00:17:12.201 --> 00:17:14.341
but not be gripped by it --

00:17:14.365 --> 00:17:17.277
he said, "For me, these
were the gifts of mindfulness."

00:17:17.301 --> 00:17:19.820
And I was so relieved
to hear that he was OK.

00:17:19.844 --> 00:17:24.765
But really heartened to see
that he had transformed his own attention.

00:17:25.252 --> 00:17:28.950
He went from having a really bad boss --

00:17:28.974 --> 00:17:31.823
an attention system
that nearly drove him off a bridge --

00:17:31.847 --> 00:17:34.565
to one that was an exquisite
leader and guide,

00:17:34.589 --> 00:17:36.210
and saved his life.

00:17:37.238 --> 00:17:41.095
So I want to actually end by sharing
my call to action to all of you.

00:17:41.119 --> 00:17:42.358
And here it is.

00:17:42.382 --> 00:17:45.060
Pay attention to your attention.

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:46.933
Alright?

00:17:46.957 --> 00:17:49.260
Pay attention to your attention

00:17:49.284 --> 00:17:54.409
and incorporate mindfulness training
as part of your daily wellness toolkit,

00:17:54.433 --> 00:17:57.648
in order to tame your own wandering mind

00:17:57.672 --> 00:18:01.477
and to allow your attention
to be a trusted guide in your own life.

00:18:01.817 --> 00:18:02.969
Thank you.

00:18:02.993 --> 00:18:07.087
(Applause)
