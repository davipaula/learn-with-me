00:00:06.583 --> 00:00:10.133
The universe began its 
cosmic life in a big bang

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.603
nearly fourteen billion
years ago,

00:00:12.603 --> 00:00:15.083
and has been expanding 
ever since.

00:00:15.083 --> 00:00:18.533
But what is it expanding into?

00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:21.186
That's a complicated question.

00:00:21.186 --> 00:00:23.166
Here's why:

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.416
Einstein's equations of
general relativity

00:00:25.416 --> 00:00:29.416
describe space and time
as a kind of inter-connected

00:00:29.416 --> 00:00:31.176
fabric for the universe.

00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:35.176
This means that what we know of
as space and time

00:00:35.176 --> 00:00:38.616
exist only as part of the universe
and not beyond it.

00:00:38.616 --> 00:00:42.656
Now, when everyday objects
expand, they move out

00:00:42.656 --> 00:00:43.986
into more space.

00:00:43.986 --> 00:00:47.986
But if there is no such thing
as space to expand into,

00:00:47.986 --> 00:00:50.536
what does expanding 
even mean?

00:00:50.536 --> 00:00:54.536
In 1929 Edwin Hubble's 
astronomy observations

00:00:54.536 --> 00:00:57.116
gave us a definitive answer.

00:00:57.116 --> 00:01:00.786
His survey of the night sky
found all faraway galaxies

00:01:00.786 --> 00:01:03.686
recede, or move away,
from the Earth.

00:01:03.686 --> 00:01:08.246
Moreover, the further the galaxy, 
the faster it recedes.

00:01:08.246 --> 00:01:10.666
How can we interpret this?

00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:14.726
Consider a loaf of raisin bread
rising in the oven.

00:01:14.726 --> 00:01:18.006
The batter rises by the same
amount in between each

00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:19.236
and every raisin.

00:01:19.236 --> 00:01:22.736
If we think of raisins as a 
stand-in for galaxies,

00:01:22.736 --> 00:01:25.066
and batter as the space
between them,

00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:28.036
we can imagine that the
stretching or expansion

00:01:28.036 --> 00:01:32.036
of intergalactic space will make 
the galaxies recede from each other,

00:01:32.622 --> 00:01:37.222
and for any galaxy, its faraway
neighbors will recede a larger

00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:39.332
distance than the nearby ones

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:41.542
in the same amount of time.

00:01:41.542 --> 00:01:46.812
Sure enough, the equations of
general relativity predict a cosmic

00:01:46.817 --> 00:01:49.977
tug-of-war between gravity 
and expansion.

00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:54.097
It's only in the dark void between
galaxies where expansion wins out,

00:01:54.097 --> 00:01:55.827
and space stretches.

00:01:55.827 --> 00:01:58.117
So there's our answer.

00:01:58.117 --> 00:02:01.007
The universe is expanding 
unto itself.

00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:06.157
That said, cosmologists are pushing 
the limits of mathematical models

00:02:06.157 --> 00:02:11.187
to speculate on what, if anything,
exists beyond our spacetime.

00:02:11.192 --> 00:02:15.722
These aren't wild guesses,
but hypotheses that tackle

00:02:15.722 --> 00:02:18.622
kinks in the scientific theory
of the Big Bang.

00:02:18.622 --> 00:02:23.802
The Big Bang predicts matter to be 
distributed evenly across the universe,

00:02:23.802 --> 00:02:28.322
as a sparse gas --but then, how 
did galaxies and stars come to be?

00:02:28.322 --> 00:02:32.122
The inflationary model 
describes a brief era

00:02:32.128 --> 00:02:34.388
of incredibly rapid expansion

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:38.028
that relates quantum fluctuations 
in the energy of the early universe,

00:02:38.028 --> 00:02:42.538
to the formation of clumps of gas 
that eventually led to galaxies.

00:02:42.538 --> 00:02:47.318
If we accept this paradigm, it may 
also imply our universe represents

00:02:47.318 --> 00:02:53.578
one region in a greater cosmic reality 
that undergoes endless, eternal inflation.

00:02:53.578 --> 00:02:57.088
We know nothing of this 
speculative inflating reality,

00:02:57.088 --> 00:03:01.088
save for the mathematical prediction 
that its endless expansion

00:03:01.088 --> 00:03:04.858
may be driven by an unstable 
quantum energy state.

00:03:04.858 --> 00:03:09.358
In many local regions, however, 
the energy may settle by random

00:03:09.358 --> 00:03:15.348
chance into a stable state, stopping 
inflation and forming bubble universes.

00:03:15.348 --> 00:03:18.158
Each bubble universe
—ours being one of them

00:03:18.158 --> 00:03:21.718
—would be described by its own 
Big Bang and laws of physics.

00:03:21.718 --> 00:03:25.098
Our universe would be part 
of a greater multiverse,

00:03:25.098 --> 00:03:29.338
in which the fantastic rate of eternal 
inflation makes it impossible

00:03:29.338 --> 00:03:31.818
for us to encounter a neighbor universe.

00:03:31.818 --> 00:03:37.378
The Big Bang also predicts that in the early, 
hot universe, our fundamental forces

00:03:37.378 --> 00:03:40.758
may unify into one super-force.

00:03:40.758 --> 00:03:44.758
Mathematical string theories suggest 
descriptions of this unification,

00:03:44.758 --> 00:03:49.248
in addition to a fundamental structure 
for sub-atomic quarks and electrons.

00:03:49.248 --> 00:03:54.908
In these proposed models, vibrating strings 
are the building blocks of the universe.

00:03:54.908 --> 00:03:59.788
Competing models for strings have now 
been consolidated into a unified description,

00:03:59.788 --> 00:04:06.138
and suggest these structures may interact 
with massive, higher dimensional surfaces called branes.

00:04:06.141 --> 00:04:09.751
Our universe may be contained 
within one such brane,

00:04:09.751 --> 00:04:16.521
floating in an unknown higher dimensional 
place, playfully named “the bulk,” or hyperspace.

00:04:16.521 --> 00:04:22.491
Other branes—containing other types of 
universes—may co-exist in hyperspace,

00:04:22.491 --> 00:04:27.371
and neighboring branes may even share 
certain fundamental forces like gravity.

00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:31.431
Both eternal inflation and branes 
describe a multiverse,

00:04:31.431 --> 00:04:37.511
but while universes in eternal inflation are 
isolated, brane universes could bump into each other.

00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:42.001
An echo of such a collision may appear 
in the cosmic microwave background

00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:46.971
—a soup of radiation throughout our universe, 
that’s a relic from an early Big Bang era.

00:04:46.971 --> 00:04:50.771
So far, though, we’ve found 
no such cosmic echo.

00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:57.231
Some suspect these differing multiverse hypotheses 
may eventually coalesce into a common description,

00:04:57.231 --> 00:04:59.871
or be replaced by something else.

00:04:59.871 --> 00:05:04.551
As it stands now, they’re speculative 
explorations of mathematical models.

00:05:04.551 --> 00:05:09.261
While these models are inspired and 
guided by many scientific experiments,

00:05:09.261 --> 00:05:13.601
there are very few objective experiments 
to directly test them, yet.

00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:15.971
Until the next Edwin Hubble comes along,

00:05:15.971 --> 00:05:20.881
scientists will likely be left to argue about 
the elegance of their competing models…

00:05:20.881 --> 00:05:27.341
and continue to dream about what, 
if anything, lies beyond our universe.
