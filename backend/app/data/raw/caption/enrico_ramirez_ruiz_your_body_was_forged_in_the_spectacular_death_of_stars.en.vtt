00:00:13.714 --> 00:00:16.531
We are all atomically connected.

00:00:16.913 --> 00:00:19.864
Fundamentally, universally.

00:00:19.888 --> 00:00:21.489
But what does that mean?

00:00:22.673 --> 00:00:25.625
I'm an astrophysicist, and as such,

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:29.684
it is my responsibility to trace
the cosmic history

00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:32.513
of every single one of your atoms.

00:00:33.394 --> 00:00:35.613
In fact, I would say

00:00:35.637 --> 00:00:39.196
that one of the greatest achievements
of modern astronomy

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.386
is the understanding of how our atoms
were actually put together.

00:00:45.823 --> 00:00:48.664
While hydrogen and helium were made

00:00:48.688 --> 00:00:51.760
during the first two minutes
of the big bang,

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:54.180
the origin of heavy elements,

00:00:54.204 --> 00:00:58.514
such as the iron in your blood,
the oxygen we're breathing,

00:00:58.538 --> 00:01:00.823
the silicone in your computers,

00:01:00.847 --> 00:01:03.982
lies in the life cycle of stars.

00:01:05.388 --> 00:01:11.411
Nuclear reactions take lighter elements
and transform them into heavier ones,

00:01:11.435 --> 00:01:13.943
and that causes stars to shine

00:01:13.967 --> 00:01:16.060
and ultimately explode,

00:01:16.084 --> 00:01:21.497
therefore enriching the universe
with these heavy elements.

00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:26.224
So without stellar death

00:01:27.101 --> 00:01:29.291
there would be no oxygen

00:01:29.315 --> 00:01:32.886
or other elements
heavier than hydrogen and helium,

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.436
and therefore, there would be no life.

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.705
There are more atoms in our bodies

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.673
than stars in the universe.

00:01:42.642 --> 00:01:45.175
And these atoms are extremely durable.

00:01:45.737 --> 00:01:47.904
The origins of our atoms

00:01:47.928 --> 00:01:53.285
can be traceable to stars
that manufactured them in their interiors

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:57.530
and exploded them
all across the Milky Way,

00:01:57.554 --> 00:01:59.538
billions of years ago.

00:02:00.006 --> 00:02:01.434
And I should know this,

00:02:01.458 --> 00:02:04.582
because I am indeed a certified
stellar mortician.

00:02:04.884 --> 00:02:06.363
(Laughter)

00:02:06.387 --> 00:02:12.133
And today, I want to take you on a journey
that starts in a supernova explosion

00:02:12.157 --> 00:02:15.727
and ends with the air
that we're breathing right now.

00:02:18.578 --> 00:02:20.445
So what is our body made of?

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:26.851
Ninety-six percent
consists of only four elements:

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.448
hydrogen, carbon, oxygen and nitrogen.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.553
Now the main character
of this cosmic tale is oxygen.

00:02:39.061 --> 00:02:43.792
Not only is the vast majority
of our bodies made of oxygen,

00:02:43.816 --> 00:02:48.522
but oxygen is the one element
fighting to protect life on earth.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.855
The vast majority of oxygen
in the universe

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:56.926
was indeed produced
over the entire history of the universe

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.950
in these supernova explosions.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.450
These supernova explosions
signal the demise of very massive stars.

00:03:04.474 --> 00:03:06.807
And for a brilliant month,

00:03:06.831 --> 00:03:11.006
one supernova explosion
can be brighter than an entire galaxy

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.442
containing billions of stars.

00:03:13.823 --> 00:03:15.490
That is truly remarkable.

00:03:17.046 --> 00:03:21.926
That is because massive stars
burn brighter

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.902
and have a spectacular death,
compared to other stars.

00:03:26.728 --> 00:03:30.244
Nuclear fusion is really
the lifeblood of all stars,

00:03:30.268 --> 00:03:31.867
including the sun,

00:03:31.891 --> 00:03:36.335
and as a result is the root source
of all the energy on earth.

00:03:37.724 --> 00:03:42.037
You can think of stars
as these fusion factories

00:03:42.061 --> 00:03:45.006
which are powered
by smashing atoms together

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.339
in their hot and dense interiors.

00:03:47.641 --> 00:03:50.196
Now, stars like our sun,

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.704
which are relatively small,

00:03:51.728 --> 00:03:53.942
burn hydrogen into helium,

00:03:53.966 --> 00:03:57.751
but heavier stars of about
eight times the mass of the sun

00:03:57.775 --> 00:04:00.251
continue this burning cycle

00:04:00.275 --> 00:04:03.924
even after they exhausted
their helium in their cores.

00:04:05.386 --> 00:04:07.268
So at this point,

00:04:07.292 --> 00:04:10.458
the massive star
is left with a carbon core,

00:04:10.482 --> 00:04:13.668
which, as you know,
is the building block of life.

00:04:14.784 --> 00:04:18.514
This carbon core continues to collapse

00:04:18.538 --> 00:04:21.045
and as a result,
the temperature increases,

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:25.023
which allows further
nuclear reactions to take place,

00:04:25.047 --> 00:04:27.675
and carbon then burns into oxygen,

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:31.365
into neon, silicon, sulphur

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.008
and ultimately iron.

00:04:33.667 --> 00:04:35.531
And iron is the end.

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:37.719
Why?

00:04:37.743 --> 00:04:40.278
Because iron is the most
bound nuclei in the universe,

00:04:40.302 --> 00:04:44.703
which means that we cannot
extract energy by burning iron.

00:04:45.268 --> 00:04:50.926
So when the entire core
of the massive star is made of iron,

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.350
it's run out of fuel.

00:04:52.871 --> 00:04:56.006
And that's an incredibly
bad day for a star.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.656
(Laughter)

00:05:00.395 --> 00:05:03.182
Without fuel, it cannot generate heat,

00:05:04.434 --> 00:05:07.234
and therefore gravity has won the battle.

00:05:08.228 --> 00:05:11.950
The iron core has no other choice
but to collapse,

00:05:11.974 --> 00:05:14.799
reaching incredibly high densities.

00:05:15.363 --> 00:05:18.656
Think of 300 million tons

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.680
reduced to a space
the size of a sugar cube.

00:05:22.458 --> 00:05:27.067
At these extreme high densities,
the core actually resists collapse,

00:05:27.091 --> 00:05:28.686
and as a result,

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.598
all of this infalling material
bounces off the core.

00:05:33.551 --> 00:05:34.816
And this dramatic bounce,

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.807
which happens in a fraction
of a second or so,

00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:44.664
is responsible for ejecting
the rest of the star in all directions,

00:05:44.688 --> 00:05:47.422
ultimately forming a supernova explosion.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:55.680
So, sadly, from the perspective
of an astrophysicist,

00:05:55.704 --> 00:05:59.103
the conditions in the centers
of these exploding stars

00:05:59.127 --> 00:06:01.410
cannot be recreated in a laboratory.

00:06:01.434 --> 00:06:02.442
(Laughter)

00:06:02.466 --> 00:06:06.085
Now, thankfully for humanity,
we're not able to do that.

00:06:06.109 --> 00:06:07.815
(Laughter)

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:09.062
But what does that mean?

00:06:09.086 --> 00:06:10.768
That means that as astrophysicists,

00:06:10.792 --> 00:06:15.152
we have to rely on sophisticated
computer simulations

00:06:15.176 --> 00:06:18.969
in order to understand
these complex phenomena.

00:06:20.358 --> 00:06:24.154
These simulations can be used
to really understand how gas behaves

00:06:24.178 --> 00:06:26.125
under such extreme conditions.

00:06:27.168 --> 00:06:29.421
And can be used to answer
fundamental questions

00:06:29.445 --> 00:06:32.620
like, "What ultimately disrupted
the massive star?"

00:06:32.644 --> 00:06:36.715
"How is it that this implosion
can be reversed into an explosion?"

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.048
There's a huge amount
of debate in the field,

00:06:42.072 --> 00:06:46.506
but we all agree that neutrinos,

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.338
which are these elusive
elementary particles,

00:06:49.362 --> 00:06:50.878
play a crucial role.

00:06:51.873 --> 00:06:53.038
Yeah?

00:06:53.062 --> 00:06:56.015
I'm about to show you
one of those simulations.

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:04.159
So neutrinos are produced in huge numbers
once the core collapses.

00:07:04.183 --> 00:07:05.354
And in fact,

00:07:05.378 --> 00:07:09.061
they are responsible for transferring
the energy in this core.

00:07:09.696 --> 00:07:12.307
Like thermal radiation in a heater,

00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:15.879
neutrinos pump energy into the core,

00:07:15.903 --> 00:07:20.315
increasing the possibility
of disrupting the star.

00:07:20.784 --> 00:07:23.545
In fact, for about a fraction of a second,

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:25.196
neutrinos pump so much energy

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.900
that the pressure increases high enough
that a shock wave is produced

00:07:29.924 --> 00:07:33.636
and the shock wave
goes and disrupts the entire star.

00:07:34.006 --> 00:07:38.284
And it is in that shock wave
where elements are produced.

00:07:40.243 --> 00:07:41.958
So thank you, neutrinos.

00:07:41.982 --> 00:07:43.577
(Laughter)

00:07:45.132 --> 00:07:48.219
Supernovas shine bright,

00:07:48.243 --> 00:07:50.434
and for a brief period of time,

00:07:50.458 --> 00:07:55.500
they radiate more energy
than the sun will in its entire lifetime.

00:07:56.852 --> 00:07:59.559
That point of light that you see there,

00:07:59.583 --> 00:08:02.884
which was certainly not there before,

00:08:02.908 --> 00:08:05.194
burns like a beacon,

00:08:05.218 --> 00:08:09.116
clearly indicating the position
where the massive star has died.

00:08:11.196 --> 00:08:13.847
In a galaxy like our own Milky Way,

00:08:13.871 --> 00:08:17.783
we estimate that about
once every 50 years,

00:08:17.807 --> 00:08:19.585
a massive star dies.

00:08:20.696 --> 00:08:23.697
This implies that somewhere
in the universe,

00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:27.152
there's a supernova explosion
every second or so.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.722
And thankfully for astronomers,

00:08:31.746 --> 00:08:35.087
some of them are actually found
relatively close to earth.

00:08:36.363 --> 00:08:42.022
Various civilizations
recorded these supernova explosions

00:08:42.046 --> 00:08:45.009
long before the telescope was invented.

00:08:46.699 --> 00:08:48.896
The most famous of all of them

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.608
is probably the supernova explosion
that gave rise to the Crab Nebula.

00:08:53.746 --> 00:08:55.014
Yeah?

00:08:55.038 --> 00:09:01.093
Korean and Chinese astronomers
recorded this supernova in 1054,

00:09:01.117 --> 00:09:03.800
as did, almost certainly,
Native Americans.

00:09:05.372 --> 00:09:10.632
This supernova happened
about 5,600 light-years away from earth.

00:09:11.205 --> 00:09:13.403
And it was so incredibly bright

00:09:13.427 --> 00:09:15.936
that astronomers could see it
during the day.

00:09:16.651 --> 00:09:21.499
And it was visible to the naked eye
for about two years in the night sky.

00:09:25.278 --> 00:09:29.641
Fast forward 1,000 years or so later,
and what do we see?

00:09:30.062 --> 00:09:34.173
We see these filaments
that were blasted by the explosion,

00:09:34.197 --> 00:09:36.713
moving at 300 miles per second.

00:09:37.133 --> 00:09:41.307
These filaments are essential
for us to understand

00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:43.264
how massive stars die.

00:09:43.752 --> 00:09:45.117
The image that you see there

00:09:45.141 --> 00:09:47.585
was assembled
by the Hubble Space Telescope

00:09:47.609 --> 00:09:49.476
over a span of three months.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:52.262
And it is incredibly important
to astronomers

00:09:52.286 --> 00:09:55.474
because it ultimately carries
the chemical legacy

00:09:55.498 --> 00:09:57.231
of the star that exploded.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:02.833
The orange filaments that you see there
are the tattered remains of the star,

00:10:02.857 --> 00:10:05.190
and are made primarily of hydrogen,

00:10:05.634 --> 00:10:08.817
while the blue and red
filaments that you see

00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:11.330
are the freshly synthesized oxygen.

00:10:11.746 --> 00:10:16.190
So studying supernova remnants,
like the Crab Nebula,

00:10:16.214 --> 00:10:18.508
allowed astronomers to firmly conclude

00:10:18.532 --> 00:10:23.975
that the vast majority of oxygen on earth
was produced by supernova explosions

00:10:23.999 --> 00:10:26.199
over the history of the universe.

00:10:27.117 --> 00:10:28.633
And we can estimate

00:10:28.657 --> 00:10:33.100
that in order to assemble
all the atoms of oxygen in our body,

00:10:33.124 --> 00:10:36.392
it took on the order
of a 100 million supernova.

00:10:37.151 --> 00:10:41.143
So every bit of you,
or at least the majority of it,

00:10:41.167 --> 00:10:43.962
came from one of these
supernova explosions.

00:10:47.268 --> 00:10:48.863
So now you may be wondering,

00:10:48.887 --> 00:10:50.887
how is it that these atoms

00:10:50.911 --> 00:10:55.664
that were generated in such
extreme conditions

00:10:55.688 --> 00:10:58.222
ultimately took residence in our body?

00:10:59.212 --> 00:11:03.081
So I want you to follow
the thought experiment.

00:11:03.105 --> 00:11:06.600
Imagine that we're in the Milky Way,
and a supernova happens.

00:11:06.998 --> 00:11:10.895
It blasted tons and tons of oxygen atoms

00:11:10.919 --> 00:11:13.228
almost into empty space.

00:11:14.085 --> 00:11:18.156
A few of them were able
to be assembled in a cloud.

00:11:19.292 --> 00:11:22.577
Now, 4.5 billion years ago,

00:11:22.601 --> 00:11:26.069
something unsettled that cloud
and caused it to collapse,

00:11:26.093 --> 00:11:30.394
forming the sun in its center
and the solar system.

00:11:32.216 --> 00:11:35.819
So the sun, the planets and life on earth

00:11:35.843 --> 00:11:38.407
depend on this beautiful cycle

00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:43.280
of stellar birth, stellar death
and stellar rebirth.

00:11:43.875 --> 00:11:48.605
And this continues the recycling
of atoms in the universe.

00:11:48.629 --> 00:11:52.615
And as a result, astronomy
and chemistry are intimately connected.

00:11:53.815 --> 00:12:00.624
We are life forms that have evolved
to inhale the waste products of plants.

00:12:01.292 --> 00:12:02.522
But now you know

00:12:02.546 --> 00:12:05.720
that we also inhale the waste products
of supernova explosions.

00:12:05.744 --> 00:12:07.442
(Laughter)

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:10.990
So take a moment, inhale.

00:12:12.228 --> 00:12:15.187
An oxygen atom
has just gone into your body.

00:12:15.211 --> 00:12:17.538
It is certain that that oxygen [atom]

00:12:17.562 --> 00:12:19.799
remembers that it was
in the interior of a star

00:12:19.823 --> 00:12:23.196
and it was probably manufactured
by a supernova explosion.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.220
This atom may have traveled
the entire solar system

00:12:28.244 --> 00:12:30.498
until it splashed on earth,

00:12:30.522 --> 00:12:32.505
long before reaching you.

00:12:34.442 --> 00:12:35.703
When we breathe,

00:12:36.982 --> 00:12:41.777
we use hundreds of liters
of oxygen every day.

00:12:43.566 --> 00:12:48.590
So I'm incredibly lucky to be standing
in front of this beautiful audience,

00:12:48.614 --> 00:12:51.852
but I'm actually stealing
your oxygen atoms.

00:12:51.876 --> 00:12:54.405
(Laughter)

00:12:54.429 --> 00:12:55.961
And because I'm speaking to you,

00:12:55.985 --> 00:12:59.548
I'm giving you some of them back,
that once resided in me.

00:13:03.276 --> 00:13:08.012
So breathing, yeah,

00:13:08.036 --> 00:13:12.125
participates in this
beautiful exchange of atoms.

00:13:12.149 --> 00:13:14.010
And you can then ask,

00:13:15.887 --> 00:13:22.887
"Well, how many atoms in our body
once belonged to Frida Kahlo?"

00:13:23.013 --> 00:13:25.403
(Laughter)

00:13:25.427 --> 00:13:27.299
About 100,000 of them.

00:13:28.339 --> 00:13:32.768
100,000 more probably
belonged to Marie Curie,

00:13:32.792 --> 00:13:35.180
100,000 more to Sally Ride,

00:13:35.204 --> 00:13:37.338
or whoever you want to think of.

00:13:39.236 --> 00:13:46.025
So breathing is not only filling our lungs
with cosmic history,

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:47.938
but with human history.

00:13:49.696 --> 00:13:52.675
I would like to end my talk
by sharing a myth

00:13:52.699 --> 00:13:54.500
that is very close to my heart.

00:13:54.524 --> 00:13:56.889
A myth from the Chichimeca culture,

00:13:56.913 --> 00:13:59.921
which is a very powerful
Mesoamerican culture.

00:14:01.001 --> 00:14:03.201
And the Chichimecas believe

00:14:03.225 --> 00:14:06.625
that our essence
was assembled in the heavens.

00:14:06.649 --> 00:14:08.815
And on its journey towards us,

00:14:08.839 --> 00:14:12.437
it actually fragmented
into tons of different pieces.

00:14:13.445 --> 00:14:15.008
So my abuelo used to say,

00:14:15.032 --> 00:14:17.754
"One of the reasons you feel incomplete

00:14:17.778 --> 00:14:19.999
is because you are missing your pieces."

00:14:20.023 --> 00:14:21.042
(Laughter)

00:14:21.066 --> 00:14:22.641
"But don't be fooled by that.

00:14:22.665 --> 00:14:26.410
You've been given an incredible
opportunity of growth.

00:14:26.434 --> 00:14:27.585
Why?

00:14:27.609 --> 00:14:30.363
Because it's not like those pieces
were scattered on earth

00:14:30.387 --> 00:14:32.149
and you have to go and pick them up.

00:14:32.173 --> 00:14:34.839
No, those pieces fell into other people.

00:14:35.489 --> 00:14:39.019
And only by sharing them
you will become more complete.

00:14:40.021 --> 00:14:41.188
Yes, during your life,

00:14:41.212 --> 00:14:44.034
there's going to be individuals
that have these huge pieces

00:14:44.058 --> 00:14:45.624
that make you feel whole.

00:14:47.355 --> 00:14:50.260
But in your quest of being complete,

00:14:50.284 --> 00:14:55.307
you have to treasure and share
every single one of those pieces."

00:14:57.391 --> 00:15:00.481
Sounds a lot like the story
of oxygen to me.

00:15:00.505 --> 00:15:01.550
(Laughter)

00:15:01.574 --> 00:15:04.828
Which started in the heavens
in a supernova explosion,

00:15:04.852 --> 00:15:07.299
and continues today,

00:15:08.061 --> 00:15:10.461
within the confines of our humanity.

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:17.172
Our atoms in our body
have embarked on an epic odyssey,

00:15:17.196 --> 00:15:22.315
with time spans from billions of years
to mere centuries,

00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:24.728
all leading to you,

00:15:24.752 --> 00:15:26.444
all of you,

00:15:26.468 --> 00:15:28.341
witnesses of the universe.

00:15:28.365 --> 00:15:29.524
Thank you.

00:15:29.548 --> 00:15:33.077
(Applause)
