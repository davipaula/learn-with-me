00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.574
A few years ago,

00:00:14.598 --> 00:00:17.357
I always had this thing happening to me,

00:00:17.381 --> 00:00:19.141
especially at family gatherings

00:00:19.165 --> 00:00:22.295
like teas with aunts and uncles
or something like this.

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:23.694
When people come up to you,

00:00:23.718 --> 00:00:26.515
and they ask you,
"So, what are you doing?"

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:30.959
And I would have
this magical one-word reply,

00:00:30.983 --> 00:00:33.175
which would make everybody happy:

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:34.525
"Medicine.

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:35.975
I'm going to be a doctor."

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:39.469
Very easy, that's it,
everybody's happy and pleased.

00:00:39.493 --> 00:00:41.087
And it could be so easy,

00:00:41.111 --> 00:00:45.678
but this effect really only lasts
for 30 seconds with me,

00:00:45.702 --> 00:00:48.981
because that's then the time
when one of them would ask,

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:51.400
"So, in what area of medicine?

00:00:51.424 --> 00:00:53.568
What specialty do you want to go into?"

00:00:54.326 --> 00:00:58.672
And then I would have to strip down
in all honesty and just say,

00:00:58.696 --> 00:01:02.166
"OK, so I'm fascinated with the colon.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.667
It all started with the anus,

00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:06.195
and now it's basically
the whole intestinal tract."

00:01:06.638 --> 00:01:08.110
(Laughter)

00:01:08.845 --> 00:01:12.143
And this would be the moment
when the enthusiasm trickled,

00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:16.662
and it would maybe also get,
like, awkwardly silent in the room,

00:01:16.686 --> 00:01:18.911
and I would think this was terribly sad,

00:01:18.935 --> 00:01:22.332
because I do believe
our bowels are quite charming.

00:01:22.356 --> 00:01:23.506
(Laughter)

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.049
And while we're in a time
where many people are thinking about

00:01:27.073 --> 00:01:29.348
what new superfood smoothie to make

00:01:29.372 --> 00:01:32.117
or if gluten is maybe bad for them,

00:01:32.141 --> 00:01:37.214
actually, hardly anyone seems to care
about the organ where this happens,

00:01:37.238 --> 00:01:40.260
the concrete anatomy
and the mechanisms behind it.

00:01:40.284 --> 00:01:41.751
And sometimes it seems to me

00:01:41.775 --> 00:01:45.012
like we're all trying
to figure out this magic trick,

00:01:45.036 --> 00:01:47.402
but nobody's checking out the magician,

00:01:47.426 --> 00:01:48.711
just because he has, like,

00:01:48.735 --> 00:01:51.113
an embarrassing hairstyle or something.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.785
And actually,

00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:58.326
there are reasons science
disliked the gut for a long time;

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.501
I have to say this.

00:01:59.525 --> 00:02:00.736
So, it's complex.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.294
There's a lot of surface area --

00:02:02.318 --> 00:02:04.522
about 40 times the area of our skin.

00:02:04.546 --> 00:02:06.125
Then, in such a tight pipe,

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.072
there are so many immune cells
that are being trained there.

00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:12.283
We have 100 trillion bacteria
doing all sorts of things --

00:02:12.307 --> 00:02:13.808
producing little molecules.

00:02:13.832 --> 00:02:16.131
Then there's about 20 different hormones,

00:02:16.155 --> 00:02:19.913
so we are on a very different level
than our genitals, for example.

00:02:19.937 --> 00:02:23.058
And the nervous system
of our gut is so complex

00:02:23.082 --> 00:02:24.810
that when we cut out a piece,

00:02:24.834 --> 00:02:27.161
it's independent enough
that when we poke it,

00:02:27.185 --> 00:02:29.533
it mumbles back at us, friendly.

00:02:29.557 --> 00:02:31.579
(Laughter)

00:02:32.078 --> 00:02:37.068
But at least those reasons are also
the reasons why it's so fascinating

00:02:37.092 --> 00:02:38.460
and important.

00:02:39.295 --> 00:02:42.547
It took me three steps to love the gut.

00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:46.353
So today, I invite you to follow me
on those three steps.

00:02:47.096 --> 00:02:49.946
The very first was just looking at it

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.010
and asking questions
like, "How does it work?"

00:02:53.034 --> 00:02:57.208
and "Why does it have to look
so weird for that sometimes?"

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.467
And it actually wasn't me asking
the first kind of these questions,

00:03:01.491 --> 00:03:02.772
but my roommate.

00:03:02.796 --> 00:03:05.554
After one heavy night of partying,

00:03:05.578 --> 00:03:08.723
he came into our shared-room kitchen,

00:03:08.747 --> 00:03:13.822
and he said, "Giulia, you study medicine.
How does pooping work?"

00:03:13.846 --> 00:03:15.254
(Laughter)

00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:18.292
And I did study medicine
but I had no idea,

00:03:18.316 --> 00:03:21.516
so I had to go up to my room
and look it up in different books.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.528
And I found something interesting,
I thought, at that time.

00:03:24.552 --> 00:03:28.409
So it turns out, we don't only have
this outer sphincter,

00:03:28.433 --> 00:03:30.341
we also have an inner sphincter muscle.

00:03:30.365 --> 00:03:32.758
The outer sphincter we all know,
we can control it,

00:03:32.782 --> 00:03:34.309
we know what's going on there;

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:35.925
the inner one, we really don't.

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.145
So what happens is,

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.634
when there are leftovers from digestion,

00:03:39.658 --> 00:03:42.152
they're being delivered
to the inner one first.

00:03:42.176 --> 00:03:44.622
This inner one will open in a reflex

00:03:44.646 --> 00:03:46.776
and let through a little bit for testing.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.453
(Laughter)

00:03:48.477 --> 00:03:50.682
So, there are sensory cells

00:03:50.706 --> 00:03:56.015
that will analyze what has been delivered:
Is it gaseous or is it solid?

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:59.134
And they will then send
this information up to our brain,

00:03:59.158 --> 00:04:01.318
and this is the moment
when our brain knows,

00:04:01.342 --> 00:04:03.339
"Oh, I have to go to the toilet."

00:04:03.363 --> 00:04:05.000
(Laughter)

00:04:06.452 --> 00:04:08.781
The brain will then do
what it's designed to do

00:04:08.805 --> 00:04:10.569
with its amazing consciousness.

00:04:10.593 --> 00:04:13.362
It will mediate with our surroundings,

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:14.863
and it will say something like,

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:16.271
"So, I checked.

00:04:16.295 --> 00:04:18.955
We are at this TEDx conference -- "

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.909
(Laughter)

00:04:23.083 --> 00:04:24.625
(Applause)

00:04:25.378 --> 00:04:26.528
Gaseous?

00:04:26.552 --> 00:04:28.788
Maybe, if you're sitting on the sides,

00:04:28.812 --> 00:04:32.201
and you know you can pull it off silently.

00:04:32.225 --> 00:04:34.065
(Laughter)

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:35.248
But solid --

00:04:35.272 --> 00:04:36.473
maybe later.

00:04:36.497 --> 00:04:37.940
(Laughter)

00:04:37.964 --> 00:04:43.394
Since our outer sphincter and the brain
is connected with nervous cells,

00:04:43.418 --> 00:04:45.436
they coordinate, cooperate,

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.781
and they put it back in a waiting line --

00:04:47.805 --> 00:04:50.030
(Laughter)

00:04:50.054 --> 00:04:51.232
for other times,

00:04:51.256 --> 00:04:54.136
like, for example, when we're at home
sitting on the couch,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.719
we have nothing better to do,

00:04:55.743 --> 00:04:57.020
we are free to go.

00:04:57.044 --> 00:04:58.906
(Laughter)

00:05:01.954 --> 00:05:06.045
Us humans are actually one
of the very few animals that do this

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:08.816
in such an advanced and clean way.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.425
To be honest, I had some newfound respect

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:13.980
for that nice, inner sphincter dude --

00:05:14.004 --> 00:05:15.878
not connected to nerves

00:05:15.902 --> 00:05:19.119
that care too much about
the outer world or the time --

00:05:19.143 --> 00:05:21.310
just caring about me for once.

00:05:21.776 --> 00:05:23.774
I thought that was nice.

00:05:23.798 --> 00:05:27.382
And I used to not be a great fan
of public restrooms,

00:05:27.406 --> 00:05:29.214
but now I can go anywhere,

00:05:29.238 --> 00:05:30.518
because I consider it more

00:05:30.542 --> 00:05:34.354
when that inner muscle puts a suggestion
on my daily agenda.

00:05:34.378 --> 00:05:36.097
(Laughter)

00:05:36.121 --> 00:05:38.848
And also I learned
something else, which was:

00:05:38.872 --> 00:05:43.107
looking closely at something
I might have shied away from --

00:05:43.131 --> 00:05:46.148
maybe the weirdest part of myself --

00:05:46.172 --> 00:05:48.396
left me feeling more fearless,

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.644
and also appreciating myself more.

00:05:51.166 --> 00:05:53.183
And I think this happens a lot of times

00:05:53.207 --> 00:05:55.221
when you look at the gut, actually.

00:05:55.245 --> 00:05:57.992
Like those funny rumbling
noises that happen

00:05:58.016 --> 00:05:59.649
when you're in a group of friends

00:05:59.673 --> 00:06:01.399
or at the office conference table,

00:06:01.423 --> 00:06:03.461
going, like, "Merrr, merrr..."

00:06:04.815 --> 00:06:06.821
This is not because we're hungry.

00:06:06.845 --> 00:06:10.772
This is because our small intestine
is actually a huge neat freak,

00:06:10.796 --> 00:06:15.041
and it takes the time in between digestion
to clean everything up,

00:06:15.065 --> 00:06:18.806
resulting in those eight meters
of gut -- really, seven of them --

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.918
being very clean
and hardly smelling like anything.

00:06:22.494 --> 00:06:26.321
It will, to achieve this,
create a strong muscular wave

00:06:26.345 --> 00:06:30.433
that moves everything forward
that's been leftover after digestion.

00:06:30.457 --> 00:06:32.257
This can sometimes create a sound,

00:06:32.281 --> 00:06:34.793
but doesn't necessarily have to always.

00:06:35.372 --> 00:06:38.014
So what we're embarrassed of
is really a sign

00:06:38.038 --> 00:06:41.209
of something keeping
our insides fine and tidy.

00:06:41.877 --> 00:06:44.803
Or this weird, crooked shape
of our stomach --

00:06:44.827 --> 00:06:46.436
a bit Quasimodo-ish.

00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:50.173
This actually makes us be able
to put pressure on our belly

00:06:50.197 --> 00:06:51.368
without vomiting,

00:06:51.392 --> 00:06:52.670
like when we're laughing

00:06:52.694 --> 00:06:54.043
and when we're doing sports,

00:06:54.067 --> 00:06:57.383
because the pressure will go up
and not so much sideways.

00:06:57.407 --> 00:06:59.292
This also creates this air bubble

00:06:59.316 --> 00:07:03.511
that's usually always very visible
in X-rays, for example,

00:07:03.535 --> 00:07:05.328
and can sometimes, with some people,

00:07:05.352 --> 00:07:07.193
when it gets too big,

00:07:07.217 --> 00:07:10.445
create discomfort
or even some sensations of pain.

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:12.619
But for most of the people,
is just results

00:07:12.643 --> 00:07:15.906
that it's far easier to burp
when you're laying on your left side

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.450
instead of your right.

00:07:18.312 --> 00:07:20.234
And soon I moved a bit further

00:07:20.258 --> 00:07:23.592
and started to look at the whole picture
of our body and health.

00:07:23.616 --> 00:07:26.006
This was actually after I had heard

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.465
that someone I knew a little bit
had killed himself.

00:07:29.489 --> 00:07:34.198
It happened that I had been sitting
next to that person the day before,

00:07:34.222 --> 00:07:37.845
and I smelled that he had very bad breath.

00:07:37.869 --> 00:07:40.114
And when I learned
of the suicide the next day,

00:07:40.138 --> 00:07:43.053
I thought: Could the gut have
something to do with it?

00:07:43.077 --> 00:07:46.293
And I frantically started searching
if there were scientific papers

00:07:46.317 --> 00:07:48.880
on the connection of gut and brain.

00:07:48.904 --> 00:07:51.262
And to my surprise, I found many.

00:07:51.809 --> 00:07:55.123
It turns out it's maybe not as simple
as we sometimes think.

00:07:55.147 --> 00:07:57.494
We tend to think our brain
makes these commands

00:07:57.518 --> 00:07:59.677
and then sends them down
to the other organs,

00:07:59.701 --> 00:08:01.393
and they all have to listen.

00:08:01.417 --> 00:08:06.611
But really, it's more that 10 percent
of the nerves that connect brain and gut

00:08:06.635 --> 00:08:09.850
deliver information
from the brain to the gut.

00:08:09.874 --> 00:08:13.005
We know this, for example,
in stressful situations,

00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:17.048
when there are transmitters from the brain
that are being sensed by our gut,

00:08:17.072 --> 00:08:20.642
so the gut will try to lower all the work,

00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:25.184
and not be working
and taking away blood and energy

00:08:25.208 --> 00:08:27.495
to save energy for problem-solving.

00:08:27.519 --> 00:08:31.016
This can go as far as nervous vomiting
or nervous diarrhea

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.155
to get rid of food that it then
doesn't want to digest.

00:08:34.869 --> 00:08:36.129
Maybe more interestingly,

00:08:36.153 --> 00:08:39.411
90 percent of the nervous fibers
that connect gut and brain

00:08:39.435 --> 00:08:42.661
deliver information
from our gut to our brain.

00:08:43.296 --> 00:08:45.250
And when you think about it a little bit,

00:08:45.274 --> 00:08:48.493
it does make sense,
because our brain is very isolated.

00:08:48.902 --> 00:08:53.247
It's in this bony skull
surrounded by a thick skin,

00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:56.258
and it needs information
to put together a feeling

00:08:56.282 --> 00:08:59.419
of "How am I, as a whole body, doing?"

00:08:59.893 --> 00:09:04.319
And the gut, actually, is possibly
the most important advisor for the brain

00:09:04.343 --> 00:09:07.050
because it's our largest sensory organ,

00:09:07.074 --> 00:09:10.846
collecting information not only
on the quality of our nutrients,

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:14.962
but really also on how are so many
of our immune cells doing,

00:09:14.986 --> 00:09:17.884
or things like the hormones
in our blood that it can sense.

00:09:17.908 --> 00:09:20.990
And it can package this information,
and send it up to the brain.

00:09:21.014 --> 00:09:25.759
It can, there, not reach areas
like visual cortex or word formations --

00:09:25.783 --> 00:09:27.578
otherwise, when we digest,

00:09:27.602 --> 00:09:32.099
we would see funny colors
or we would make funny noises -- no.

00:09:32.123 --> 00:09:34.990
But it can reach areas
for things like morality,

00:09:35.014 --> 00:09:36.873
fear or emotional processing

00:09:36.897 --> 00:09:38.836
or areas for self-awareness.

00:09:39.377 --> 00:09:40.824
So it does make sense

00:09:40.848 --> 00:09:44.496
that when our body and our brain
are putting together this feeling

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.949
of, "How am I, as a whole body, doing?"

00:09:46.973 --> 00:09:52.079
that the gut has something
to contribute to this process.

00:09:52.103 --> 00:09:53.322
And it also makes sense

00:09:53.346 --> 00:09:56.612
that people who have conditions
like irritable bowel syndrome

00:09:56.636 --> 00:09:58.472
or inflammatory bowel disease

00:09:58.496 --> 00:10:01.848
have a higher risk of having
anxiety or depression.

00:10:01.872 --> 00:10:04.378
I think this is good information to share,

00:10:04.402 --> 00:10:05.916
because many people will think,

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.325
"I have this gut thing, and maybe
I also have this mental health thing."

00:10:09.349 --> 00:10:12.642
And maybe -- because science is not
clear on that right now --

00:10:12.666 --> 00:10:15.978
it's really just that the brain
is feeling sympathy with their gut.

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:21.575
This has yet to grow in evidence
until it can come to practice.

00:10:21.599 --> 00:10:24.190
But just knowing about
these kinds of research

00:10:24.214 --> 00:10:26.260
that's out there at the moment

00:10:26.284 --> 00:10:28.499
helps me in my daily life.

00:10:28.523 --> 00:10:30.843
And it makes me think
differently of my moods

00:10:30.867 --> 00:10:33.679
and not externalize so much all the time.

00:10:33.703 --> 00:10:37.972
I feel oftentimes during the day
we are a brain and a screen,

00:10:37.996 --> 00:10:40.823
and we will tend to look
for answers right there

00:10:40.847 --> 00:10:43.122
and maybe the work is stupid
or our neighbor --

00:10:43.146 --> 00:10:45.484
but really, moods can also
come from within.

00:10:45.508 --> 00:10:47.345
And just knowing this helped me,

00:10:47.369 --> 00:10:50.599
for example, when I sometimes
wake up too early,

00:10:50.623 --> 00:10:53.334
and I start to worry and wander
around with my thoughts.

00:10:53.358 --> 00:10:56.389
Then I think, "Stop.
What did I eat yesterday?

00:10:56.413 --> 00:10:58.114
Did I stress myself out too much?

00:10:58.138 --> 00:11:00.174
Did I eat too late or something?"

00:11:00.198 --> 00:11:02.437
And then maybe get up
and make myself a tea,

00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:03.987
something light to digest.

00:11:04.011 --> 00:11:06.086
And as simple as that sounds,

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:09.170
I think it's been
surprisingly good for me.

00:11:10.469 --> 00:11:15.343
Step three took me further
away from our body,

00:11:15.367 --> 00:11:18.468
and to really understanding
bacteria differently.

00:11:18.985 --> 00:11:22.233
The research we have today
is creating a new definition

00:11:22.257 --> 00:11:24.480
of what real cleanliness is.

00:11:25.366 --> 00:11:28.899
And it's not the hygiene hypothesis --

00:11:28.923 --> 00:11:30.304
I think many maybe know this.

00:11:30.328 --> 00:11:33.870
So it states that when you have
too little microbes in your environment

00:11:33.894 --> 00:11:35.495
because you clean all the time,

00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:37.121
that's not really a good thing,

00:11:37.145 --> 00:11:40.819
because people get more allergies
or autoimmune diseases then.

00:11:40.843 --> 00:11:43.061
So I knew this hypothesis,

00:11:43.085 --> 00:11:44.938
and I thought I wouldn't learn so much

00:11:44.962 --> 00:11:47.426
from looking at cleanliness in the gut.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:48.777
But I was wrong.

00:11:49.385 --> 00:11:51.334
It turns out,

00:11:51.358 --> 00:11:55.323
real cleanliness is not about
killing off bacteria right away.

00:11:55.347 --> 00:11:57.956
Real cleanliness is a bit different.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:59.508
When we look at the facts,

00:11:59.532 --> 00:12:04.372
95 percent of all bacteria on this planet
don't harm us -- they can't,

00:12:04.396 --> 00:12:06.181
they don't have the genes to do so.

00:12:06.896 --> 00:12:08.937
Many, actually, help us a lot,

00:12:08.961 --> 00:12:12.198
and scientists at the moment
are looking into things like:

00:12:12.222 --> 00:12:14.843
Do some bacteria help us clean the gut?

00:12:14.867 --> 00:12:16.241
Do they help us digest?

00:12:16.265 --> 00:12:18.734
Do they make us put on weight
or have a lean figure

00:12:18.758 --> 00:12:20.673
although we're eating lots?

00:12:20.697 --> 00:12:25.374
Are others making us feel more courageous
or even more resilient to stress?

00:12:25.398 --> 00:12:29.393
So you see, there are more questions
when it comes to cleanliness.

00:12:30.171 --> 00:12:33.445
And, actually, the thing is,
it's about a healthy balance, I think.

00:12:33.469 --> 00:12:35.882
You can't avoid the bad all the time.

00:12:35.906 --> 00:12:37.639
This is simply not possible;

00:12:37.663 --> 00:12:39.632
there's always something bad around.

00:12:40.094 --> 00:12:44.769
So what really the whole deal is
when you look at a clean gut,

00:12:44.793 --> 00:12:48.615
it's about having good bacteria,
enough of them,

00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:49.874
and then some bad.

00:12:50.444 --> 00:12:52.332
Our immune system needs the bad, too,

00:12:52.356 --> 00:12:54.894
so it knows what it's looking out for.

00:12:54.918 --> 00:12:58.353
So I started having this different
perspective on cleanliness

00:12:58.377 --> 00:12:59.763
and a few weeks later,

00:12:59.787 --> 00:13:01.919
I held a talk at my university,

00:13:01.943 --> 00:13:04.039
and I made a mistake by 1,000.

00:13:04.063 --> 00:13:06.497
And I went home and I realized
in that moment,

00:13:06.521 --> 00:13:09.536
I was like, "Ah! I made
a mistake by 1,000.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.643
Oh God, that's so much,
and that's so embarrassing."

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:15.434
And I started to think about this,
I was like, "Ugh!"

00:13:15.458 --> 00:13:16.649
And after a while I said,

00:13:16.673 --> 00:13:18.503
"OK, I made this one mistake,

00:13:18.527 --> 00:13:22.611
but then I also told so many
good and right and helpful things,

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.106
so I think it's OK, you know?

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:25.500
It's a clean thing."

00:13:25.524 --> 00:13:27.952
And then I was like, "Oh, wait.

00:13:27.976 --> 00:13:31.142
Maybe I took my perspective
on cleanliness further."

00:13:31.166 --> 00:13:33.848
And it's my theory at the moment
that maybe we all do.

00:13:33.872 --> 00:13:36.642
Take it a bit further than just
cleaning our living room,

00:13:36.666 --> 00:13:39.772
where maybe we make it
to sort like a life hygiene.

00:13:39.796 --> 00:13:43.429
Knowing that this is about
fostering the good

00:13:43.453 --> 00:13:47.092
just as much as trying to shelter
yourself from the bad

00:13:47.116 --> 00:13:49.180
had a very calming effect on me.

00:13:49.753 --> 00:13:51.209
So in that sense,

00:13:51.233 --> 00:13:54.923
I hope today I told you
mostly good and helpful things,

00:13:54.947 --> 00:13:56.493
and thank you for your time,

00:13:56.517 --> 00:13:57.928
for listening to me.

00:13:57.952 --> 00:14:00.761
(Applause)
