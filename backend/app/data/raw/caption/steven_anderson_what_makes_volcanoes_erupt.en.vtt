00:00:06.876 --> 00:00:12.132
In February of 1942, 
Mexican farmer Dionisio Pulido

00:00:12.132 --> 00:00:15.962
thought he heard thunder 
coming from his cornfield.

00:00:15.962 --> 00:00:19.740
However, the sound wasn’t coming 
from the sky.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.440
The source was a large, smoking crack 
emitting gas and ejecting rocks.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.560
This fissure would come to be known as 
the volcano Paricutin,

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:36.706
and over the next 9 years, its lava 
and ash would cover over 200 square km.

00:00:36.706 --> 00:00:39.056
But where did this new volcano come from,

00:00:39.056 --> 00:00:43.160
and what triggered 
its unpredictable eruption?

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.690
The story of any volcano 
begins with magma.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.820
Often, this molten rock forms 
in areas where ocean water

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.094
is able to slip into the Earth’s mantle 
and lower the layer’s melting point.

00:00:56.094 --> 00:01:00.114
The resulting magma typically remains 
under the Earth’s surface

00:01:00.114 --> 00:01:04.226
thanks to the delicate balance 
of three geological factors.

00:01:04.226 --> 00:01:06.859
The first is lithostatic pressure.

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:11.780
This is the weight of the Earth’s crust 
pushing down on the magma below.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.570
Magma pushes back with the second factor, 
magmastatic pressure.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.500
The battle between these forces 
strains the third factor:

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.696
the rock strength of the Earth’s crust.

00:01:23.696 --> 00:01:26.846
Usually, the rock is strong enough 
and heavy enough

00:01:26.846 --> 00:01:28.916
to keep the magma in place.

00:01:28.916 --> 00:01:34.701
But when this equilibrium is thrown off, 
the consequences can be explosive.

00:01:34.701 --> 00:01:37.421
One of the most common causes 
of an eruption

00:01:37.421 --> 00:01:40.320
is an increase 
in magmastatic pressure.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.590
Magma contains various elements 
and compounds,

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.740
many of which are dissolved 
in the molten rock.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.067
At high enough concentrations, compounds 
like water or sulfur no longer dissolve,

00:01:53.067 --> 00:01:56.887
and instead form 
high-pressure gas bubbles.

00:01:56.887 --> 00:01:59.122
When these bubbles reach the surface,

00:01:59.122 --> 00:02:02.320
they can burst with the force 
of a gunshot.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.950
And when millions of bubbles 
explode simultaneously,

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.200
the energy can send plumes of ash 
into the stratosphere.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.495
But before they pop, they act 
like bubbles of C02 in a shaken soda.

00:02:15.495 --> 00:02:18.355
Their presence lowers 
the magma’s density,

00:02:18.355 --> 00:02:23.098
and increases the buoyant force 
pushing upward through the crust.

00:02:23.098 --> 00:02:28.191
Many geologists believe this process 
was behind the Paricutin eruption

00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:30.011
in Mexico.

00:02:30.011 --> 00:02:33.518
There are two known natural causes 
for these buoyant bubbles.

00:02:33.518 --> 00:02:36.688
Sometimes, new magma 
from deeper underground

00:02:36.688 --> 00:02:40.658
brings additional gassy compounds 
into the mix.

00:02:40.658 --> 00:02:44.806
But bubbles can also form 
when magma begins to cool.

00:02:44.806 --> 00:02:50.149
In its molten state, magma is a mixture
of dissolved gases and melted minerals.

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:55.621
As the molten rock hardens, some of those 
minerals solidify into crystals.

00:02:55.621 --> 00:02:59.621
This process doesn’t incorporate 
many of the dissolved gasses,

00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:02.912
resulting in a higher concentration 
of the compounds

00:03:02.912 --> 00:03:06.362
that form explosive bubbles.

00:03:06.362 --> 00:03:10.332
Not all eruptions are due 
to rising magmastatic pressure—

00:03:10.332 --> 00:03:15.062
sometimes the weight of the rock 
above can become dangerously low.

00:03:15.062 --> 00:03:20.231
Landslides can remove massive quantities 
of rock from atop a magma chamber,

00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:25.201
dropping the lithostatic pressure 
and instantly triggering an eruption.

00:03:25.201 --> 00:03:27.921
This process is known as “unloading”

00:03:27.921 --> 00:03:30.822
and it’s been responsible 
for numerous eruptions,

00:03:30.822 --> 00:03:35.544
including the sudden explosion 
of Mount St. Helens in 1980.

00:03:35.544 --> 00:03:39.114
But unloading can also happen 
over longer periods of time

00:03:39.114 --> 00:03:41.762
due to erosion or melting glaciers.

00:03:41.762 --> 00:03:45.232
In fact, many geologists 
are worried that glacial melt

00:03:45.232 --> 00:03:49.722
caused by climate change 
could increase volcanic activity.

00:03:49.722 --> 00:03:54.295
Finally, eruptions can occur when 
the rock layer is no longer strong enough

00:03:54.295 --> 00:03:56.735
to hold back the magma below.

00:03:56.735 --> 00:03:59.942
Acidic gases and heat escaping from magma

00:03:59.942 --> 00:04:04.568
can corrode rock through a process 
called hydrothermal alteration,

00:04:04.568 --> 00:04:08.448
gradually turning hard stone 
into soft clay.

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:12.088
The rock layer could also be weakened 
by tectonic activity.

00:04:12.088 --> 00:04:16.777
Earthquakes can create fissures 
allowing magma to escape to the surface,

00:04:16.777 --> 00:04:19.789
and the Earth’s crust 
can be stretched thin

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:23.267
as continental plates 
shift away from each other.

00:04:23.267 --> 00:04:26.217
Unfortunately, knowing 
what causes eruptions

00:04:26.217 --> 00:04:28.617
doesn’t make them easy to predict.

00:04:28.617 --> 00:04:31.837
While scientists can roughly determine 
the strength and weight

00:04:31.837 --> 00:04:33.227
of the Earth’s crust,

00:04:33.227 --> 00:04:37.007
the depth and heat of magma chambers 
makes measuring changes

00:04:37.007 --> 00:04:40.387
in magmastatic pressure very difficult.

00:04:40.387 --> 00:04:44.297
But volcanologists are constantly 
exploring new technology

00:04:44.297 --> 00:04:46.844
to conquer this rocky terrain.

00:04:46.844 --> 00:04:49.749
Advances in thermal imaging 
have allowed scientists

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:52.409
to detect subterranean hotspots.

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:55.839
Spectrometers can analyze 
gases escaping magma.

00:04:55.839 --> 00:05:02.103
And lasers can precisely track the impact 
of rising magma on a volcano’s shape.

00:05:02.103 --> 00:05:06.595
Hopefully, these tools will help us better
understand these volatile vents

00:05:06.595 --> 00:05:08.801
and their explosive eruptions.
