00:00:06.658 --> 00:00:09.187
What's the worst bug on the planet?

00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:12.174
You might vote for the horsefly
or perhaps the wasp,

00:00:12.198 --> 00:00:13.285
but for many people,

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.203
the worst offender is by far the mosquito.

00:00:16.227 --> 00:00:17.683
The buzzing, the biting,

00:00:17.707 --> 00:00:18.725
the itching,

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:22.697
the mosquito is one of the most commonly
detested pests in the world.

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:25.228
In Alaska, swarms
of mosquitos can get so thick

00:00:25.252 --> 00:00:27.444
that they actually asphyxiate caribou.

00:00:27.468 --> 00:00:30.436
And mosquito-borne diseases
kill millions of people every year.

00:00:31.491 --> 00:00:33.567
The scourge
that is the mosquito isn't new.

00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:36.723
Mosquitoes have been around
for over a hundred million years

00:00:36.747 --> 00:00:39.649
and over that time have coevolved
with all sorts of species,

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:41.076
including our own.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.210
There are actually thousands
of species of mosquitos in the world,

00:00:44.234 --> 00:00:46.274
but they all share one insidious quality:

00:00:46.298 --> 00:00:47.445
they suck blood,

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.779
and they're really, really
good at sucking blood.

00:00:50.803 --> 00:00:52.116
Here's how they do it.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.950
After landing, a mosquito will slather

00:00:53.974 --> 00:00:57.183
some saliva onto the victim's skin,
which works like an antiseptic,

00:00:57.207 --> 00:00:59.507
numbing the spot so we don't
notice their attack.

00:00:59.531 --> 00:01:02.019
This is what causes the itchy,
red bumps, by the way.

00:01:02.043 --> 00:01:04.093
Then the bug will use
its serrated mandibles

00:01:04.117 --> 00:01:05.907
to carve a little hole in your skin,

00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:08.226
allowing it to probe around
with its proboscis,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.663
searching for a blood vessel.

00:01:09.687 --> 00:01:11.830
When it hits one,
the lucky parasite can suck

00:01:11.854 --> 00:01:13.765
two to three times its weight in blood.

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:15.933
Turns out we don't really
like that too much.

00:01:15.957 --> 00:01:17.785
In fact, humans hate mosquitos so much

00:01:17.809 --> 00:01:19.864
that we spend billions
of dollars worldwide

00:01:19.888 --> 00:01:21.276
to keep them away from us --

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.444
from citronella candles

00:01:22.468 --> 00:01:25.148
to bug sprays to heavy-duty
agricultural pesticides.

00:01:25.172 --> 00:01:27.347
But it's not just
that mosquitos are annoying,

00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:28.695
they're also deadly.

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:31.726
Mosquitos can transmit everything
from malaria to yellow fever

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.661
to West Nile virus to dengue.

00:01:33.685 --> 00:01:35.280
Over a million people worldwide

00:01:35.304 --> 00:01:37.708
die every year
from mosquito-borne diseases,

00:01:37.732 --> 00:01:39.240
and that's just people.

00:01:39.264 --> 00:01:40.494
Horses, dogs, cats,

00:01:40.518 --> 00:01:42.992
they can all get diseases
from mosquitoes too.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.684
So, if these bugs are so dastardly,
why don't we just get rid of them?

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:48.851
We are humans after all,

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:51.161
and we're pretty good
at getting rid of species.

00:01:51.185 --> 00:01:52.986
Well, it's not quite so simple.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.312
Getting rid of the mosquito
removes a food source

00:01:55.336 --> 00:01:57.851
for lots of organisms,
like frogs and fish and birds.

00:01:57.875 --> 00:02:00.148
Without them,
plants would lose a pollinator.

00:02:00.172 --> 00:02:01.408
But some scientists say

00:02:01.432 --> 00:02:03.993
that mosquitos aren't
actually all that important.

00:02:04.017 --> 00:02:05.734
If we got rid of them, they argue,

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:07.901
another species would simply
take their place

00:02:07.925 --> 00:02:11.053
and we'd probably have far
fewer deaths from malaria.

00:02:11.077 --> 00:02:13.893
The problem is that nobody
knows what would happen

00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:15.656
if we killed off all the mosquitos.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.498
Something better might take their spot

00:02:17.522 --> 00:02:20.494
or perhaps something even worse.

00:02:20.518 --> 00:02:23.402
The question is,
are we willing to take that risk?

00:02:23.426 --> 00:02:25.092
