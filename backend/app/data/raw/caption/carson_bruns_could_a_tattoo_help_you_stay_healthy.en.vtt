00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:18.059
I'd like to introduce you
to an interesting person named Ötzi.

00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:19.601
He lives in Italy

00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:22.101
at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:23.792
because he's a mummy.

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:27.809
This is an artist's rendition
of what he might have looked like

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:29.458
when he was alive 5,300 years ago.

00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:32.434
You want to see what he looks like today?

00:00:32.458 --> 00:00:33.768
(Laughter)

00:00:33.792 --> 00:00:36.667
OK, brace yourselves,
gross mummy pic coming at you.

00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:42.309
So, he's not as handsome as he used to be,

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:45.101
but he's actually
in great shape for a mummy

00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:47.417
because he was discovered frozen in ice.

00:00:48.417 --> 00:00:52.643
Ötzi is the oldest mummy that's been
discovered with preserved skin.

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:54.768
5,300 years is super old,

00:00:54.792 --> 00:00:57.059
older than the Egyptian pyramids,

00:00:57.083 --> 00:01:03.018
and Ötzi's skin is covered
in 61 black tattoos,

00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:05.518
all lines and crosses on parts of his body

00:01:05.542 --> 00:01:08.393
where he might have experienced pain.

00:01:08.417 --> 00:01:10.976
So scientists think
that they might have been used

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.934
to mark sites for some kind of therapy,

00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.208
like acupuncture.

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:19.018
So clearly, if the oldest skin we've seen

00:01:19.042 --> 00:01:20.684
is all tattooed up,

00:01:20.708 --> 00:01:23.351
tattooing is a very ancient practice.

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:27.268
But fast-forward to today
and tattoos are everywhere.

00:01:27.292 --> 00:01:30.143
Almost one in four Americans has a tattoo,

00:01:30.167 --> 00:01:32.851
it's a multibillion-dollar industry,

00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:35.434
and whether you love tattoos or hate them,

00:01:35.458 --> 00:01:38.125
this talk will change the way
you think about them.

00:01:38.833 --> 00:01:41.250
So, why are tattoos so popular?

00:01:42.542 --> 00:01:47.292
Unlike Ötzi, most of us today use tattoos
for some kind of self-expression.

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:51.393
Personally, I love tattoos
because I love art

00:01:51.417 --> 00:01:53.726
and there is something so wonderful to me,

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.226
almost romantic, about the way
a tattoo as an art form

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.726
cannot be commodified.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.268
Right? Your tattoo
lives and dies with you.

00:02:02.292 --> 00:02:04.976
It can't be bought or sold or traded,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.268
so its only value
is really personal to you,

00:02:07.292 --> 00:02:09.184
and I love that.

00:02:09.208 --> 00:02:11.893
Now, I tend to gravitate
towards really colorful tattoos

00:02:11.917 --> 00:02:13.643
because I'm obsessed with color.

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:16.268
I teach a whole course on it
at my university.

00:02:16.292 --> 00:02:19.434
But my very first tattoo
was an all-black tattoo

00:02:19.458 --> 00:02:21.184
like Ötzi's.

00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:24.851
Yep, I did that clichéd thing
that young people do sometimes

00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:28.059
and I got a tattoo
in a language I can't even read.

00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:29.643
(Laughter)

00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:32.434
OK, but I was 19 years old,

00:02:32.458 --> 00:02:35.559
I had just returned
from my first trip overseas,

00:02:35.583 --> 00:02:37.976
I was in Japan in the mountains

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.476
meditating in Buddhist monasteries,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.768
and it was a really meaningful
experience to me,

00:02:42.792 --> 00:02:46.101
so I wanted to commemorate it
with this Japanese and Chinese character

00:02:46.125 --> 00:02:47.417
for "mountain."

00:02:48.708 --> 00:02:51.934
Now, here's what blows my mind.

00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.393
My 14-year-old tattoo

00:02:54.417 --> 00:02:57.934
and Ötzi's 5,300-year-old tattoos

00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:01.018
are made of the same exact stuff:

00:03:01.042 --> 00:03:02.601
soot,

00:03:02.625 --> 00:03:04.726
that black powdery carbon dust

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.351
that gets left behind in the fireplace
when you burn stuff.

00:03:08.375 --> 00:03:12.559
And if you zoom way, way in
on either my tattoo or Ötzi's tattoos,

00:03:12.583 --> 00:03:15.000
you'll find that they all
look something like this.

00:03:16.167 --> 00:03:19.726
A tattoo is nothing more
than a bunch of tiny pigment particles,

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.476
soot in this case,

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.018
that get trapped in the dermis,

00:03:23.042 --> 00:03:26.893
which is the layer of tissue
right underneath the surface of the skin.

00:03:26.917 --> 00:03:29.643
So in over five thousand years,

00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:32.851
we've done very little
to update tattoo technology,

00:03:32.875 --> 00:03:35.559
apart from getting access to more colors

00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:38.375
and slightly more efficient
methods of installation.

00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.934
While I'm an artist, I'm also a scientist,

00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:46.851
and I direct a laboratory
that researches nanotechnology,

00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:51.143
which is the science of building things
with ultratiny building blocks,

00:03:51.167 --> 00:03:54.809
thousands of times smaller even
than the width of a human hair.

00:03:54.833 --> 00:03:56.643
And I began to ask myself,

00:03:56.667 --> 00:03:59.083
how could nanotechnology serve tattooing?

00:04:00.125 --> 00:04:03.393
If tattoos are just
a bunch of particles in the skin,

00:04:03.417 --> 00:04:07.500
could we swap those particles out for ones
that do something more interesting?

00:04:08.542 --> 00:04:10.393
Here's my big idea:

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:13.184
I believe that tattoos
can give you superpowers.

00:04:13.208 --> 00:04:14.851
(Laughter)

00:04:14.875 --> 00:04:17.101
Now, I don't mean
they're going to make us fly,

00:04:17.125 --> 00:04:19.393
but I do think
that we can have superpowers

00:04:19.417 --> 00:04:23.226
in the sense that tattoos
can give us new abilities

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.958
that we don't currently possess.

00:04:26.167 --> 00:04:29.934
By upgrading the particles,
we can engineer tattooing

00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:33.142
so that it will change
not only the appearance of our skin,

00:04:33.166 --> 00:04:34.917
but also the function of our skin.

00:04:36.083 --> 00:04:37.643
Let me show you.

00:04:37.667 --> 00:04:40.458
This is a diagram of a microcapsule.

00:04:41.083 --> 00:04:44.184
It's a tiny hollow particle
with a protective outer shell,

00:04:44.208 --> 00:04:46.268
about the size of a tattoo pigment,

00:04:46.292 --> 00:04:49.333
and you can fill the inside
with practically whatever you want.

00:04:50.417 --> 00:04:54.684
So what if we put interesting materials
inside of these microcapsules

00:04:54.708 --> 00:04:56.208
and made tattoo inks with them?

00:04:57.083 --> 00:04:59.583
What sorts of things
could we make a tattoo do?

00:05:00.458 --> 00:05:02.684
What problems could we solve?

00:05:02.708 --> 00:05:04.792
What human limitations could we overcome?

00:05:06.208 --> 00:05:07.500
Well, here's one idea:

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:10.476
one of our weaknesses as humans

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.476
is that we can't see
ultraviolet, or UV, light.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.393
That's the high-energy part of sunlight

00:05:16.417 --> 00:05:19.708
that causes sunburn
and increases our risk of skin cancer.

00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:24.292
Many animals and insects
can actually see UV light, but we can't.

00:05:25.292 --> 00:05:29.250
If we could, we'd be able to see sunscreen
when it was applied on our skin.

00:05:30.208 --> 00:05:33.393
Unfortunately, most of us
don't wear sunscreen,

00:05:33.417 --> 00:05:35.018
and those of us who do

00:05:35.042 --> 00:05:38.351
can't really tell when it wears off,
because it's invisible.

00:05:38.375 --> 00:05:41.018
It's the main reason
we treat over five million cases

00:05:41.042 --> 00:05:44.809
of preventable skin cancer
every year in the US alone,

00:05:44.833 --> 00:05:47.750
costing our economy
over five billion dollars annually.

00:05:49.167 --> 00:05:52.208
So how could we overcome
this human weakness with a tattoo?

00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:57.518
Well, if the problem is
that we can't see UV rays,

00:05:57.542 --> 00:06:00.559
maybe we can make a tattoo
detect them for us.

00:06:00.583 --> 00:06:04.143
So I thought, why don't we take
some microcapsules,

00:06:04.167 --> 00:06:08.101
load it up with a UV-sensitive,
color-changing dye,

00:06:08.125 --> 00:06:09.750
and make a tattoo ink out of that?

00:06:11.167 --> 00:06:15.518
Now, one of the troubles
of being a tattoo technologist

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:17.518
is finding willing test subjects.

00:06:17.542 --> 00:06:19.059
(Laughter)

00:06:19.083 --> 00:06:22.559
And when it came time
to test this tattoo ink,

00:06:22.583 --> 00:06:26.393
I thought it best not to torture
my poor graduate students.

00:06:26.417 --> 00:06:30.958
So I decided to tattoo
a couple of spots on my own arm instead.

00:06:31.875 --> 00:06:35.059
And It actually worked. Check it out!

00:06:35.083 --> 00:06:37.393
I call these tattoos solar freckles

00:06:37.417 --> 00:06:39.893
because they're powered by sunshine.

00:06:39.917 --> 00:06:41.518
And right now, they're invisible,

00:06:41.542 --> 00:06:45.184
but as soon as I expose them
to a UV light, acting as the Sun --

00:06:45.208 --> 00:06:46.542
there they are, blue spots.

00:06:47.542 --> 00:06:50.601
Now, I'm not wearing
sunscreen in this video,

00:06:50.625 --> 00:06:53.726
but if I was, those blue spots
would not appear,

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.059
and then when my sunscreen wore off later,

00:06:56.083 --> 00:06:58.559
the solar freckles
would reappear in UV light

00:06:58.583 --> 00:07:01.809
and I would know that it was time
to reapply sunscreen.

00:07:01.833 --> 00:07:05.768
So these tattoos act
as a real-time, naked-eye indicator

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:07.500
of your skin's UV exposure.

00:07:08.583 --> 00:07:09.893
And of course,

00:07:09.917 --> 00:07:14.851
I think there are lots of really cool,
artistic things you could do

00:07:14.875 --> 00:07:17.250
with a color-changing tattoo like this,

00:07:18.292 --> 00:07:22.226
but I hope that it will also
help us solve a big problem

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.309
in skin protection.

00:07:24.333 --> 00:07:29.542
(Applause)

00:07:32.583 --> 00:07:34.768
Let me give you another example.

00:07:34.792 --> 00:07:39.934
Normal human body temperature
is about 97 to 99 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.268
and if you fall outside of that range,

00:07:42.292 --> 00:07:45.309
you need to seek
medical attention right away.

00:07:45.333 --> 00:07:49.059
Now, the problem is that humans
can't detect our own body temperature

00:07:49.083 --> 00:07:50.893
without a thermometer.

00:07:50.917 --> 00:07:53.643
Sure, you could try the old
hand-on-the-forehead trick,

00:07:53.667 --> 00:07:56.184
but there's zero scientific
evidence to back that up.

00:07:56.208 --> 00:07:57.976
(Laughter)

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.726
So what if we could create
a tattooable thermometer

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.458
that you could access anytime?

00:08:03.333 --> 00:08:07.601
Well, remember how the solar freckles
used a UV-sensitive dye

00:08:07.625 --> 00:08:10.809
inside of the microcapsules
of the tattoo ink?

00:08:10.833 --> 00:08:13.434
Well, you could also put
heat-sensitive dyes

00:08:13.458 --> 00:08:15.226
inside of microcapsules

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.184
and you could make different tattoo inks

00:08:17.208 --> 00:08:19.559
that change color
at different temperatures.

00:08:19.583 --> 00:08:24.667
Suppose it was 96, 98,
and a hundred degrees Fahrenheit.

00:08:25.417 --> 00:08:27.684
If you place those inks side by side,

00:08:27.708 --> 00:08:29.601
now you have a temperature scale

00:08:29.625 --> 00:08:31.625
tuned to the human body.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:37.143
In this video, you can see
the different patches of tattoos

00:08:37.167 --> 00:08:38.518
disappearing sequentially

00:08:38.542 --> 00:08:40.726
as the pigskin we tested them on

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.476
is heated up.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.518
So if you were to place a tattoo like this

00:08:44.542 --> 00:08:49.308
in a location that was stable
to external temperature fluctuations --

00:08:49.332 --> 00:08:52.375
maybe inside of the mouth,
perhaps on the back of the lip? --

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.143
then you'd be able to read
your body temperature anytime

00:08:56.167 --> 00:08:58.333
by just glancing
at your tattoo in the mirror.

00:08:59.042 --> 00:09:00.292
Amazing, right?

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.059
(Applause)

00:09:03.083 --> 00:09:04.393
Thank you.

00:09:04.417 --> 00:09:07.976
(Applause)

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.184
Another limitation that we have as humans

00:09:10.208 --> 00:09:13.476
is that our skin
doesn't conduct electricity,

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.559
and that can be a good thing,
but not necessarily --

00:09:16.583 --> 00:09:18.184
(Laughter)

00:09:18.208 --> 00:09:22.059
if you have an electronic
biomedical implant,

00:09:22.083 --> 00:09:24.309
like a pacemaker for example.

00:09:24.333 --> 00:09:26.601
Right now, if you have a pacemaker,

00:09:26.625 --> 00:09:31.143
you need surgery every five or 10 years
to replace the battery when it dies.

00:09:31.167 --> 00:09:33.726
And wouldn't it be nice if, instead,

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.333
we could simply recharge the battery
through a patch of conducting skin?

00:09:38.708 --> 00:09:41.934
Well, if you were to try to tackle
that problem with a tattoo,

00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:45.851
the first step would be to make a tattoo
that conducts electricity.

00:09:45.875 --> 00:09:49.268
So we've been working on
a conducting tattoo ink in my lab.

00:09:49.292 --> 00:09:55.226
And right now, we're able to increase
the conductivity of skin over 300-fold

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.125
with our conducting tattoo ink.

00:09:57.833 --> 00:10:00.768
Now, we have a long way to go
before we reach the conductivity

00:10:00.792 --> 00:10:02.518
of something like a copper wire,

00:10:02.542 --> 00:10:05.643
but we're making progress
and I'm really excited about this

00:10:05.667 --> 00:10:09.184
because I think that it could open up
a whole new world of possibility

00:10:09.208 --> 00:10:11.101
for tattoos.

00:10:11.125 --> 00:10:15.059
I envision a future
where tattoos enable us --

00:10:15.083 --> 00:10:19.101
tattooable wires and tattooable
electronics enable us

00:10:19.125 --> 00:10:23.226
to merge our technologies with our bodies

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.684
so that they feel more like
extensions of ourselves

00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:27.250
rather than external devices.

00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:33.101
So these are a few examples
of the new abilities that we can gain

00:10:33.125 --> 00:10:38.184
by using nanotechnology
to upgrade our tattoos,

00:10:38.208 --> 00:10:40.476
but this really is only the beginning.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.875
I believe the sky is the limit
for what we can do with high-tech tattoos.

00:10:45.708 --> 00:10:49.351
In the future, tattoos
will not only be beautiful,

00:10:49.375 --> 00:10:50.792
they'll be functional too.

00:10:51.833 --> 00:10:53.309
Thank you.

00:10:53.333 --> 00:10:56.917
