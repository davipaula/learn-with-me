00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:16.951
Why do we see illusions?

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:19.631
I'm going to tell you
about some of my research,

00:00:19.655 --> 00:00:22.935
where I provided evidence
for a different kind of hypothesis

00:00:22.959 --> 00:00:25.396
than the one that might be in the book

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.798
on your coffee stand.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.071
Alright, so let's look
at one of the illusions here.

00:00:31.412 --> 00:00:34.156
And this is a stand-in for many,
many kinds of illusions

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.006
that are explained by this hypothesis.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.771
I'm just going to walk through it
for this particular one.

00:00:38.795 --> 00:00:40.003
As usual in these things,

00:00:40.027 --> 00:00:41.908
these two lines are, in fact, parallel,

00:00:41.932 --> 00:00:44.989
but you perceive them to bow
outwards at their centers.

00:00:45.402 --> 00:00:48.055
At the center where
those radial lines are,

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.356
it's wider in your visual field
than the parts above and below.

00:00:52.182 --> 00:00:53.356
And this is remarkable,

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.672
because it's a remarkably simple stimulus.

00:00:55.696 --> 00:00:57.411
It's just a bunch of straight lines.

00:00:57.435 --> 00:01:00.388
Why should one of the most
complicated objects in the universe

00:01:00.412 --> 00:01:03.643
be unable to render
this incredibly simple image?

00:01:04.484 --> 00:01:06.786
When you want to answer
questions like this,

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.048
you need to ask,

00:01:08.072 --> 00:01:11.194
well, what might this mean to your brain?

00:01:11.633 --> 00:01:13.777
And what your brain
is going to think this is,

00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:15.574
is not some lines on a page.

00:01:15.598 --> 00:01:18.526
Your brain has evolved to handle
the kinds of natural stimuli

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.541
that it encounters in real life.

00:01:20.565 --> 00:01:23.865
So when does the brain
encounter stimuli like this?

00:01:24.444 --> 00:01:26.374
Well, it seems a bit odd, but in fact,

00:01:26.398 --> 00:01:29.115
you've been encountering
this stimulus all day long.

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:30.317
Whenever you move,

00:01:30.341 --> 00:01:32.515
whenever you move forward, in particular.

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.992
When you move forward, you get optic flow,

00:01:36.016 --> 00:01:37.960
flowing outwards in your visual field,

00:01:37.984 --> 00:01:39.996
like when the Enterprise goes into warp.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.984
All of these objects flow outwards

00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:45.854
and they leave trails,
or blur lines, on your retina.

00:01:45.878 --> 00:01:48.488
They're activating
mini-neurons all in a row.

00:01:49.424 --> 00:01:52.395
So, this is a version
of what happens in real life

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:55.644
and this another version
of what happens in real life all the time.

00:01:55.668 --> 00:01:58.020
In fact, cartoonists know about this.

00:01:58.044 --> 00:02:00.092
They put these blur lines
in their cartoons

00:02:00.116 --> 00:02:02.087
and it means to your brain: motion.

00:02:02.111 --> 00:02:04.663
Now, it's not that in real life
you see blur lines.

00:02:04.687 --> 00:02:07.869
The point is that it's the stimulus
at the back of your eye

00:02:07.893 --> 00:02:10.128
that has these optic blurs in them,

00:02:10.152 --> 00:02:12.769
and that's what tells your brain
that you're moving.

00:02:12.793 --> 00:02:15.362
When you move forward,
your eyes fixate like cameras,

00:02:15.386 --> 00:02:17.227
like snapshot cameras,

00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:20.116
it fixates, it fixates,
little (Snapshot sound) camera shots,

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.587
and each time it fixates
when you're moving forward,

00:02:22.611 --> 00:02:24.254
you get all this flowing outwards.

00:02:24.278 --> 00:02:26.412
So when you take a fixation,

00:02:26.436 --> 00:02:28.654
you end up with this weird
optic blur stuff,

00:02:28.678 --> 00:02:30.821
and it tells you
the direction you're moving.

00:02:30.845 --> 00:02:32.440
Alright, that's half the story.

00:02:32.464 --> 00:02:34.004
That's what this stimulus means.

00:02:34.028 --> 00:02:35.621
It means that your brain thinks,

00:02:35.645 --> 00:02:37.418
when it's looking at the first image,

00:02:37.442 --> 00:02:40.287
that you're actually on your way,
moving towards the center.

00:02:40.311 --> 00:02:41.469
It still doesn't explain

00:02:41.493 --> 00:02:44.792
why you should perceive
these straight lines as bowed outwards.

00:02:44.816 --> 00:02:46.546
To understand the rest of the story,

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.260
you have to understand
that our brains are slow.

00:02:50.212 --> 00:02:53.653
What you would like
is that when light hits your eye,

00:02:53.677 --> 00:02:56.487
then -- ping! -- immediately
you have a perception

00:02:56.511 --> 00:02:58.073
of what the world is like.

00:02:58.097 --> 00:02:59.488
But it doesn't work that way.

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:03.195
It takes about a tenth of a second
for your perception to be created.

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.475
And a tenth of a second
doesn't sound very long,

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:07.457
but it's a long time in normal behaviors.

00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:11.021
If you're moving just at one meter
per second, which is fairly slow,

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:13.642
then in a tenth of second,
you've moved 10 centimeters.

00:03:13.666 --> 00:03:16.140
So if you didn't correct for this delay,

00:03:16.164 --> 00:03:19.994
then anything that you perceived
to be within 10 centimeters of you,

00:03:20.018 --> 00:03:21.408
by the time you perceived it,

00:03:21.432 --> 00:03:23.691
you would have bumped
into it or just passed it.

00:03:23.715 --> 00:03:26.015
And of course, this
is going to be much worse --

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.380
(Laughter)

00:03:27.404 --> 00:03:29.901
it's going to be much worse
in a situation like this.

00:03:29.925 --> 00:03:32.455
Your perception is behind.

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:35.538
What you want is that your perception
should look like this.

00:03:35.562 --> 00:03:38.095
You want your perceptions at any time T

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:40.632
to be of the world at time T.

00:03:41.466 --> 00:03:44.827
But the only way your brain
can do that, is that it has to,

00:03:44.851 --> 00:03:48.028
instead of generating a perception
of the way the world was

00:03:48.052 --> 00:03:49.485
when light hit your retina,

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:51.106
it has to do something fancier.

00:03:51.614 --> 00:03:55.082
It can't passively respond
and create a best guess,

00:03:55.106 --> 00:03:58.264
it has to create a best guess
about the next moment.

00:03:58.677 --> 00:04:01.412
What will the world look like
in a tenth of a second?

00:04:01.436 --> 00:04:03.030
Build a perception of that,

00:04:03.054 --> 00:04:07.858
because by the time your perception
of the near future occurs in your brain,

00:04:07.882 --> 00:04:09.454
the near future will have arrived

00:04:09.478 --> 00:04:12.109
and you'll have a perception
of the present,

00:04:12.133 --> 00:04:13.575
which is what you want.

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:14.754
In my research,

00:04:14.778 --> 00:04:17.795
I provided a lot of evidence --
and there's other research areas

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:19.254
that have provided evidence --

00:04:19.278 --> 00:04:21.207
that the brain is filled with mechanisms

00:04:21.231 --> 00:04:23.145
that try to compensate for its slowness.

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.348
And I've shown that huge swaths
of illusions are explained by this,

00:04:26.372 --> 00:04:27.721
this just being one example.

00:04:27.745 --> 00:04:29.134
But let me finish by saying,

00:04:29.158 --> 00:04:32.087
how exactly does this explain
this particular example?

00:04:32.987 --> 00:04:35.192
So, the question, really, we have to ask

00:04:35.216 --> 00:04:39.884
is: how do those two vertical lines
in that first stimulus,

00:04:39.908 --> 00:04:42.267
how do they change in the next moment

00:04:42.291 --> 00:04:44.716
were I moving towards the center,

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.573
that all those optical lines
are suggesting that I'm moving.

00:04:47.597 --> 00:04:48.959
What happens to them?

00:04:48.983 --> 00:04:50.134
Well, let's imagine.

00:04:50.158 --> 00:04:51.728
Imagine you've got a doorway.

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:53.658
You've got a doorway.

00:04:53.682 --> 00:04:56.632
Imagine it's a cathedral doorway,
to make it more concrete --

00:04:56.656 --> 00:04:58.043
it'll be helpful in a second.

00:04:58.067 --> 00:04:59.710
When you're very far away from it,

00:04:59.734 --> 00:05:01.929
the sides are perfectly parallel.

00:05:02.433 --> 00:05:04.751
But now imagine what happens
when you get closer.

00:05:04.775 --> 00:05:07.292
It all flows outwards
in your visual field,

00:05:07.316 --> 00:05:08.497
flowing outwards.

00:05:08.521 --> 00:05:10.088
But when you're really close --

00:05:10.112 --> 00:05:12.501
imagine the sides of the doorway
are here and here,

00:05:12.525 --> 00:05:16.227
but if you look up at this cathedral
doorway and do your fingers like this,

00:05:16.251 --> 00:05:18.206
the sides of the doorway are going up,

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.268
like railroad tracks in the sky.

00:05:20.292 --> 00:05:22.347
What started off as two parallel lines,

00:05:22.371 --> 00:05:24.804
in fact, bows outwards at eye level,

00:05:24.828 --> 00:05:27.522
and doesn't go outwards
nearly as much above.

00:05:27.546 --> 00:05:28.701
So in the next moment,

00:05:28.725 --> 00:05:31.351
you have a shape that's more
like this next picture.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.230
The projective geometry --
that is, the way the things project,

00:05:36.254 --> 00:05:38.569
in fact, change in this way
in the next moment.

00:05:38.593 --> 00:05:41.942
So when you have a stimulus like this,
well, your brain has no problem,

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:43.488
there's just two vertical lines

00:05:43.512 --> 00:05:46.340
and no cues that there'll be a change
in the next moment,

00:05:46.364 --> 00:05:47.924
so just render it as it is.

00:05:47.948 --> 00:05:49.548
But if you add cues --

00:05:49.572 --> 00:05:51.725
and this is just one of many kinds of cues

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:53.791
that can lead to these kinds of illusions,

00:05:53.815 --> 00:05:56.048
this very strong optic blur cue --

00:05:56.072 --> 00:05:58.165
then you're going to perceive instead

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:00.743
exactly how it will appear
in the next moment.

00:06:00.767 --> 00:06:04.712
All of our perceptions are always
trying to be about the present,

00:06:04.736 --> 00:06:08.920
but you have to perceive the future
to, in fact, perceive the present.

00:06:08.944 --> 00:06:11.643
And these illusions are failed
perceptions of the future,

00:06:11.667 --> 00:06:13.887
because they're just
static images on the page,

00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:16.286
they're not changing like in real life.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.931
And let me just end
by showing one illusion here.

00:06:18.955 --> 00:06:20.498
If I can, I'll quickly show two.

00:06:20.522 --> 00:06:21.688
This one's fun.

00:06:21.712 --> 00:06:23.814
If you just fixate at the middle there,

00:06:23.838 --> 00:06:26.183
and make stabbing motions with your head,

00:06:26.207 --> 00:06:27.871
looming towards it like this.

00:06:28.561 --> 00:06:30.210
Everybody do that.

00:06:30.234 --> 00:06:31.626
Make short, stabbing motions.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.996
Because I've added blur
to these optic flow lines,

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.502
your brain says,
"They're probably already moving,

00:06:36.526 --> 00:06:37.813
that's why they're blurry."

00:06:37.837 --> 00:06:40.890
When you do it, they should
be bursting out in your visual field

00:06:40.914 --> 00:06:42.071
faster than they should.

00:06:42.095 --> 00:06:43.778
They shouldn't be moving that much.

00:06:43.802 --> 00:06:46.572
And a final one I'll just leave
in the background is this.

00:06:46.596 --> 00:06:48.980
Here are the cues of motion,

00:06:49.004 --> 00:06:52.258
the kinds of cues that you get
on your retina when things are moving.

00:06:52.282 --> 00:06:54.603
You don't have to do
anything -- just look at it.

00:06:54.627 --> 00:06:57.678
Raise your hand if things are moving
when they shouldn't be.

00:06:59.003 --> 00:07:00.154
It's weird, right?

00:07:00.178 --> 00:07:03.626
But what you have now are the cues
that, from your brain's point of view,

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.041
you have the stimulus on your eyes, like,
"Oh, these things are moving."

00:07:07.065 --> 00:07:09.891
Render a perception
of what they'll do in the next moment --

00:07:09.915 --> 00:07:12.317
they should be moving
and they should have shifted.

00:07:12.341 --> 00:07:13.809
Alright, thank you very much.

00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:16.356
(Applause)
