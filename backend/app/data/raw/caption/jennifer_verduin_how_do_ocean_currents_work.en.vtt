00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:07.989
In 1992,

00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:12.211
a cargo ship carrying bath toys 
got caught in a storm.

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:14.647
Shipping containers washed overboard,

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:20.837
and the waves swept 28,000 rubber ducks 
and other toys into the North Pacific.

00:00:20.837 --> 00:00:22.697
But they didn’t stick together.

00:00:22.697 --> 00:00:23.977
Quite the opposite–

00:00:23.977 --> 00:00:27.307
the ducks have since washed up 
all over the world,

00:00:27.307 --> 00:00:29.557
and researchers have used their paths

00:00:29.557 --> 00:00:33.727
to chart a better understanding
of ocean currents.

00:00:33.727 --> 00:00:36.493
Ocean currents are driven 
by a range of sources:

00:00:36.493 --> 00:00:40.043
the wind, tides, changes in water density,

00:00:40.043 --> 00:00:43.073
and the rotation of the Earth.

00:00:43.073 --> 00:00:47.733
The topography of the ocean floor 
and the shoreline modifies those motions,

00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.360
causing currents to speed up,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.200
slow down, or change direction.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.030
Ocean currents fall into 
two main categories:

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.290
surface currents and deep ocean currents.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.050
Surface currents control the motion

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.660
of the top 10 percent 
of the ocean’s water,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.230
while deep-ocean currents mobilize 
the other 90 percent.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.930
Though they have different causes,

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.960
surface and deep ocean currents 
influence each other

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.160
in an intricate dance that keeps 
the entire ocean moving.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.185
Near the shore,

00:01:16.185 --> 00:01:19.635
surface currents are driven 
by both the wind and tides,

00:01:19.635 --> 00:01:24.505
which draw water back and forth 
as the water level falls and rises.

00:01:24.505 --> 00:01:29.773
Meanwhile, in the open ocean, wind is the 
major force behind surface currents.

00:01:29.773 --> 00:01:31.517
As wind blows over the ocean,

00:01:31.517 --> 00:01:34.507
it drags the top layers 
of water along with it.

00:01:34.507 --> 00:01:37.477
That moving water pulls on 
the layers underneath,

00:01:37.477 --> 00:01:39.697
and those pull on the ones beneath them.

00:01:39.697 --> 00:01:43.197
In fact, water as deep as 400 meters

00:01:43.197 --> 00:01:47.027
is still affected by the wind 
at the ocean’s surface.

00:01:47.027 --> 00:01:51.337
If you zoom out to look at the patterns 
of surface currents all over the earth,

00:01:51.337 --> 00:01:54.820
you’ll see that they form 
big loops called gyres,

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.580
which travel clockwise 
in the northern hemisphere

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.430
and counter-clockwise 
in the southern hemisphere.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.620
That’s because of the way 
the Earth’s rotation

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.630
affects the wind patterns that
give rise to these currents.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.280
If the earth didn’t rotate,

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.740
air and water would simply 
move back and forth

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.820
between low pressure at the equator

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.610
and high pressure at the poles.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.350
But as the earth spins,

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.860
air moving from the equator to the 
North Pole is deflected eastward,

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.509
and air moving back down 
is deflected westward.

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:27.299
The mirror image happens 
in the southern hemisphere,

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.229
so that the major streams of wind

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:32.789
form loop-like patterns 
around the ocean basins.

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:35.679
This is called the Coriolis Effect.

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:40.129
The winds push the ocean beneath 
them into the same rotating gyres.

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.793
And because water holds onto heat 
more effectively than air,

00:02:43.793 --> 00:02:48.303
these currents help redistribute 
warmth around the globe.

00:02:48.303 --> 00:02:49.864
Unlike surface currents,

00:02:49.864 --> 00:02:55.014
deep ocean currents are driven primarily 
by changes in the density of seawater.

00:02:55.014 --> 00:02:57.326
As water moves towards the North Pole,

00:02:57.326 --> 00:02:58.496
it gets colder.

00:02:58.496 --> 00:03:01.036
It also has a higher 
concentration of salt,

00:03:01.036 --> 00:03:05.956
because the ice crystals that form 
trap water while leaving salt behind.

00:03:05.956 --> 00:03:08.796
This cold, salty water is more dense,

00:03:08.796 --> 00:03:09.946
so it sinks,

00:03:09.946 --> 00:03:12.616
and warmer surface water takes its place,

00:03:12.616 --> 00:03:17.076
setting up a vertical current called 
thermohaline circulation.

00:03:17.076 --> 00:03:21.563
Thermohaline circulation of deep water 
and wind-driven surface currents

00:03:21.563 --> 00:03:26.319
combine to form a winding loop 
called the Global Conveyor Belt.

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.486
As water moves from the depths of 
the ocean to the surface,

00:03:29.486 --> 00:03:32.606
it carries nutrients that nourish the 
microorganisms

00:03:32.606 --> 00:03:35.726
which form the base of many 
ocean food chains.

00:03:35.726 --> 00:03:39.306
The global conveyor belt is the
longest current in the world,

00:03:39.306 --> 00:03:41.306
snaking all around the globe.

00:03:41.306 --> 00:03:44.906
But it only moves a few 
centimeters per second.

00:03:44.906 --> 00:03:49.456
It could take a drop of water 
a thousand years to make the full trip.

00:03:49.456 --> 00:03:52.996
However, rising sea temperatures are 
causing the conveyor belt

00:03:52.996 --> 00:03:54.956
to seemingly slow down.

00:03:54.956 --> 00:03:57.746
Models show this causing havoc with 
weather systems

00:03:57.746 --> 00:03:59.616
on both sides of the Atlantic,

00:03:59.616 --> 00:04:02.856
and no one knows what would happen if it 
continues to slow

00:04:02.856 --> 00:04:05.146
or if it stopped altogether.

00:04:05.146 --> 00:04:09.136
The only way we’ll be able to forecast
correctly and prepare accordingly

00:04:09.136 --> 00:04:13.826
will be to continue to study currents 
and the powerful forces that shape them.
