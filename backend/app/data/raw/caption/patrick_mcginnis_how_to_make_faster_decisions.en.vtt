00:00:12.263 --> 00:00:14.294
You're probably familiar with FOMO.

00:00:14.318 --> 00:00:15.778
[This guy invented the term]

00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:17.678
That's short for "Fear Of Missing Out."

00:00:17.702 --> 00:00:18.966
It's that feeling you get

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.537
when it seems everyone else
is doing something better

00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:22.868
than what you're doing now.

00:00:22.892 --> 00:00:25.078
But there's another FO
you need to know about,

00:00:25.102 --> 00:00:26.508
and it's far more dangerous.

00:00:26.532 --> 00:00:27.899
It's called FOBO,

00:00:27.923 --> 00:00:30.438
and it's short for "Fear
Of a Better Option."

00:00:30.462 --> 00:00:33.296
[The Way We Work]

00:00:34.842 --> 00:00:37.308
We live in a world of overwhelming choice.

00:00:37.332 --> 00:00:39.142
Even decisions that used to be simple,

00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:42.198
like choosing a restaurant
or making everyday purchases,

00:00:42.222 --> 00:00:44.148
are now fraught with overanalysis.

00:00:44.172 --> 00:00:46.778
Technology has only made
the issue more pronounced.

00:00:46.802 --> 00:00:49.288
If you want to buy a pair
of white shoelaces online,

00:00:49.312 --> 00:00:51.328
you have to sort
through thousands of items

00:00:51.352 --> 00:00:53.198
and read through hundreds of reviews.

00:00:53.222 --> 00:00:55.768
That's an astounding amount
of information to process

00:00:55.792 --> 00:00:59.278
to just buy two pieces of string
that cost less than your morning latte.

00:00:59.302 --> 00:01:02.058
Chances are you've experienced
FOBO when you've struggled

00:01:02.082 --> 00:01:05.258
to choose just one from a group
of perfectly acceptable outcomes.

00:01:05.282 --> 00:01:07.330
It's a symptom
of a culture which sees value

00:01:07.354 --> 00:01:10.168
in collecting and preserving
as many options as possible.

00:01:10.192 --> 00:01:12.268
You might wonder
why all of this is so bad.

00:01:12.292 --> 00:01:13.531
It seems counterintuitive.

00:01:13.555 --> 00:01:16.176
Shouldn't it be a privilege
to have so many good options

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.351
to choose from?

00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:20.678
The problem is, FOBO induces
such severe analysis paralysis

00:01:20.702 --> 00:01:24.048
that it can negatively impact
both your personal and professional life.

00:01:24.072 --> 00:01:26.268
When you can't make
decisions with conviction,

00:01:26.292 --> 00:01:27.998
you waste precious time and energy.

00:01:28.022 --> 00:01:30.168
Luckily, there is a way to overcome FOBO.

00:01:30.192 --> 00:01:31.398
Here's a secret.

00:01:31.422 --> 00:01:34.598
With any decision you make,
you first have to determine the stakes,

00:01:34.622 --> 00:01:37.068
as this will inform
your decision-making strategy.

00:01:37.092 --> 00:01:38.363
When it comes down to it,

00:01:38.387 --> 00:01:40.939
you only really face three
types of decisions in life:

00:01:40.963 --> 00:01:43.508
high stakes, low stakes and no stakes.

00:01:43.532 --> 00:01:45.348
Let's start with no-stakes decisions.

00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:47.108
These are the minor details of life,

00:01:47.132 --> 00:01:49.438
where there is almost
never an incorrect answer,

00:01:49.462 --> 00:01:51.496
and in a few hours,
you won't even remember

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.678
making the decision.

00:01:52.702 --> 00:01:55.368
A good example of this is
choosing what to watch on TV.

00:01:55.392 --> 00:01:58.028
With thousands of shows,
it's easy to get overwhelmed,

00:01:58.052 --> 00:01:59.386
yet no matter what you pick,

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.098
the consequences
are basically nonexistent.

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:04.448
So spending more
than a few moments on FOBO

00:02:04.472 --> 00:02:06.488
is a massive waste of energy.

00:02:06.512 --> 00:02:07.788
You just need to move on.

00:02:07.812 --> 00:02:09.574
When it comes to no-stakes decisions,

00:02:09.598 --> 00:02:12.268
the key is to outsource them
to the universe.

00:02:12.292 --> 00:02:15.037
For example, you can whittle down
your choices to just two

00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:16.368
and then flip a coin.

00:02:16.392 --> 00:02:19.128
Or try my personal
favorite -- ask the watch.

00:02:19.152 --> 00:02:21.867
Assign each one of your choices
to one half of your watch,

00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:25.128
then let the second hand tell you
what you're going to do.

00:02:25.152 --> 00:02:26.819
Looks like I'll be having the fish.

00:02:26.843 --> 00:02:28.738
That brings us to low-stakes decisions.

00:02:28.762 --> 00:02:31.718
These have consequences,
but none are earth-shattering,

00:02:31.742 --> 00:02:34.098
and there are plenty
of acceptable outcomes.

00:02:34.122 --> 00:02:37.098
Many routine things at work,
like purchasing a printer,

00:02:37.122 --> 00:02:40.712
booking a hotel or choosing
between possible venues for an off-site

00:02:40.736 --> 00:02:42.878
are classically low-stakes in nature.

00:02:42.902 --> 00:02:44.218
Some thinking is required,

00:02:44.242 --> 00:02:46.698
but these aren't
make-or-break deliberations,

00:02:46.722 --> 00:02:49.258
and you'll probably forget
about them in a few weeks.

00:02:49.282 --> 00:02:51.418
Here, you can also
outsource decision-making,

00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:53.538
but you want some critical
thinking involved,

00:02:53.562 --> 00:02:55.078
as there are some stakes.

00:02:55.102 --> 00:02:57.148
This time, you'll outsource to a person.

00:02:57.172 --> 00:02:58.568
Set some basic criteria,

00:02:58.592 --> 00:03:00.592
select someone to present
a recommendation,

00:03:00.616 --> 00:03:01.928
and then take their advice.

00:03:01.952 --> 00:03:04.298
Make sure to avoid
the temptation to canvass.

00:03:04.322 --> 00:03:05.894
Your goal is to clear your plate,

00:03:05.918 --> 00:03:07.608
not to kick the can down the road.

00:03:07.632 --> 00:03:10.358
Now that you tackled low-stakes
and no-stakes decisions,

00:03:10.382 --> 00:03:12.488
you've created the space
and time you'll need

00:03:12.512 --> 00:03:14.048
to handle high-stakes decisions.

00:03:14.072 --> 00:03:16.358
These are things like
"which house should I buy"

00:03:16.382 --> 00:03:17.898
or "which job should I accept."

00:03:17.922 --> 00:03:20.968
Since the stakes are high
and there are long-term implications,

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:22.728
you absolutely want to get it right.

00:03:22.752 --> 00:03:25.728
Before we get to work,
let's establish a few basic principles

00:03:25.752 --> 00:03:27.398
to guide you through the process.

00:03:27.422 --> 00:03:29.598
First, think about
what really matters to you,

00:03:29.622 --> 00:03:31.368
and set your criteria accordingly.

00:03:31.392 --> 00:03:33.228
Second, gather the relevant facts.

00:03:33.252 --> 00:03:35.698
Make sure you collect data
about all of the options,

00:03:35.722 --> 00:03:36.906
so you can be confident

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.138
that you're truly making
an informed decision.

00:03:39.162 --> 00:03:41.128
And third, remember that FOBO, by nature,

00:03:41.152 --> 00:03:43.228
comes when you struggle to choose just one

00:03:43.252 --> 00:03:45.908
from a group of perfectly
acceptable options.

00:03:45.932 --> 00:03:47.898
So no matter what you choose,

00:03:47.922 --> 00:03:50.358
you can rest assured
that the downside is limited.

00:03:50.382 --> 00:03:52.538
Now that you've established
some ground rules,

00:03:52.562 --> 00:03:53.798
the process can begin.

00:03:53.822 --> 00:03:56.708
Start by identifying a front-runner
based on your intuition,

00:03:56.732 --> 00:03:58.938
then compare each of
your options head-to-head

00:03:58.962 --> 00:04:00.598
with the front-runner, one-by-one.

00:04:00.622 --> 00:04:03.668
Each time, choose the better of the two
based on the criteria,

00:04:03.692 --> 00:04:05.058
and discard the other one.

00:04:05.082 --> 00:04:07.108
Here's the trick to avoiding FOBO.

00:04:07.132 --> 00:04:09.768
When you eliminate
an option, it's gone forever.

00:04:09.792 --> 00:04:11.808
If you keep returning
to discarded options,

00:04:11.832 --> 00:04:13.008
you risk getting stuck.

00:04:13.032 --> 00:04:16.558
Now repeat this process
until you get down to one final choice.

00:04:16.582 --> 00:04:18.068
If you follow this system,

00:04:18.092 --> 00:04:20.521
you will usually end up
with a decision on your own.

00:04:20.545 --> 00:04:22.638
On the rare occasion that you get stuck,

00:04:22.662 --> 00:04:24.424
you will outsource the final decision

00:04:24.448 --> 00:04:27.188
to a small group of qualified
people who you trust

00:04:27.212 --> 00:04:29.588
and who are equipped
to provide you with guidance

00:04:29.612 --> 00:04:30.908
on this particular topic.

00:04:30.932 --> 00:04:33.904
Engage a group of five or less,
ideally an odd number of people

00:04:33.928 --> 00:04:36.482
so that you have a built-in
tiebreaker if you need it.

00:04:36.506 --> 00:04:39.478
Now that you've made your choice,
one last challenge remains.

00:04:39.502 --> 00:04:40.658
You have to commit.

00:04:40.682 --> 00:04:44.672
I can't promise you that you'll ever truly
know if you've made the perfect decision,

00:04:44.696 --> 00:04:45.898
but I can tell you this:

00:04:45.922 --> 00:04:48.113
a significant percentage
of people in the world

00:04:48.137 --> 00:04:50.348
will never have to worry about FOBO.

00:04:50.372 --> 00:04:53.198
Unlike the billions of people
who have few options, if any,

00:04:53.222 --> 00:04:55.648
due to war, poverty or illness,

00:04:55.672 --> 00:04:58.938
you have plentiful opportunities
to live decisively.

00:04:58.962 --> 00:05:00.677
You may not get everything you want,

00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:03.328
but the mere fact
you get to decide is powerful.

00:05:03.352 --> 00:05:05.138
In fact, it's a gift.

00:05:05.162 --> 00:05:06.312
Make the most of it.
