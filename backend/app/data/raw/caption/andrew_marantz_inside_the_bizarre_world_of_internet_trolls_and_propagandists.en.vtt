00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:14.223
I spent the past three years

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:17.430
talking to some of the worst
people on the internet.

00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:20.637
Now, if you've been online recently,

00:00:20.661 --> 00:00:24.465
you may have noticed that there's
a lot of toxic garbage out there:

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:29.442
racist memes, misogynist propaganda,
viral misinformation.

00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.665
So I wanted to know
who was making this stuff.

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.027
I wanted to understand
how they were spreading it.

00:00:34.051 --> 00:00:35.438
Ultimately, I wanted to know

00:00:35.462 --> 00:00:38.031
what kind of impact
it might be having on our society.

00:00:38.055 --> 00:00:42.066
So in 2016, I started tracing
some of these memes back to their source,

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.592
back to the people who were making them
or who were making them go viral.

00:00:45.616 --> 00:00:47.250
I'd approach those people and say,

00:00:47.274 --> 00:00:50.180
"Hey, I'm a journalist.
Can I come watch you do what you do?"

00:00:50.204 --> 00:00:51.800
Now, often the response would be,

00:00:51.824 --> 00:00:53.571
"Why in hell would I want to talk to

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:55.794
some low-t soy-boy
Brooklyn globalist Jew cuck

00:00:55.818 --> 00:00:57.905
who's in cahoots with the Democrat Party?"

00:00:57.929 --> 00:00:59.181
(Laughter)

00:00:59.205 --> 00:01:03.040
To which my response would be,
"Look, man, that's only 57 percent true."

00:01:03.064 --> 00:01:04.236
(Laughter)

00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:06.473
But often I got the opposite response.

00:01:06.497 --> 00:01:07.785
"Yeah, sure, come on by."

00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:10.706
So that's how I ended up
in the living room

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.855
of a social media propagandist
in Southern California.

00:01:14.386 --> 00:01:16.767
He was a married white guy
in his late 30s.

00:01:16.791 --> 00:01:19.973
He had a table in front of him
with a mug of coffee,

00:01:19.997 --> 00:01:21.567
a laptop for tweeting,

00:01:21.591 --> 00:01:23.439
a phone for texting

00:01:23.463 --> 00:01:26.699
and an iPad for livestreaming
to Periscope and YouTube.

00:01:27.258 --> 00:01:28.419
That was it.

00:01:28.998 --> 00:01:30.268
And yet, with those tools,

00:01:30.292 --> 00:01:34.007
he was able to propel his fringe,
noxious talking points

00:01:34.031 --> 00:01:36.442
into the heart of
the American conversation.

00:01:37.144 --> 00:01:39.167
For example, one of the days I was there,

00:01:39.191 --> 00:01:42.343
a bomb had just exploded in New York,

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:45.842
and the guy accused of planting the bomb
had a Muslim-sounding name.

00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:50.008
Now, to the propagandist in California,
this seemed like an opportunity,

00:01:50.032 --> 00:01:51.748
because one of the things he wanted

00:01:51.772 --> 00:01:54.334
was for the US to cut off
almost all immigration,

00:01:54.358 --> 00:01:56.917
especially from Muslim-majority countries.

00:01:57.424 --> 00:01:59.479
So he started livestreaming,

00:01:59.503 --> 00:02:01.739
getting his followers
worked up into a frenzy

00:02:01.763 --> 00:02:04.538
about how the open borders agenda
was going to kill us all

00:02:04.562 --> 00:02:06.330
and asking them to tweet about this,

00:02:06.354 --> 00:02:07.823
and use specific hashtags,

00:02:07.847 --> 00:02:09.705
trying to get those hashtags trending.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:10.948
And tweet they did --

00:02:10.972 --> 00:02:12.836
hundreds and hundreds of tweets,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.239
a lot of them featuring
images like this one.

00:02:15.263 --> 00:02:17.040
So that's George Soros.

00:02:17.064 --> 00:02:19.709
He's a Hungarian billionaire
and philanthropist,

00:02:19.733 --> 00:02:22.328
and in the minds
of some conspiracists online,

00:02:22.352 --> 00:02:24.920
George Soros is like
a globalist bogeyman,

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:29.054
one of a few elites who is secretly
manipulating all of global affairs.

00:02:29.078 --> 00:02:32.670
Now, just to pause here:
if this idea sounds familiar to you,

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:35.086
that there are a few elites
who control the world

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.691
and a lot of them happen to be rich Jews,

00:02:37.715 --> 00:02:41.419
that's because it is one of the most
anti-Semitic tropes in existence.

00:02:42.296 --> 00:02:45.694
I should also mention that the guy
in New York who planted that bomb,

00:02:45.718 --> 00:02:47.209
he was an American citizen.

00:02:47.785 --> 00:02:49.989
So whatever else was going on there,

00:02:50.013 --> 00:02:52.186
immigration was not the main issue.

00:02:53.332 --> 00:02:56.164
And the propagandist in California,
he understood all this.

00:02:56.188 --> 00:02:58.709
He was a well-read guy.
He was actually a lawyer.

00:02:58.733 --> 00:03:00.420
He knew the underlying facts,

00:03:00.444 --> 00:03:03.635
but he also knew that facts
do not drive conversation online.

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.366
What drives conversation online

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.619
is emotion.

00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:09.461
See, the original premise of social media

00:03:09.485 --> 00:03:11.734
was that it was going
to bring us all together,

00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:14.137
make the world more open
and tolerant and fair ...

00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:15.415
And it did some of that.

00:03:16.503 --> 00:03:19.226
But the social media algorithms
have never been built

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.588
to distinguish between
what's true or false,

00:03:21.612 --> 00:03:25.522
what's good or bad for society,
what's prosocial and what's antisocial.

00:03:25.965 --> 00:03:28.202
That's just not what those algorithms do.

00:03:28.226 --> 00:03:30.781
A lot of what they do
is measure engagement:

00:03:30.805 --> 00:03:33.826
clicks, comments, shares,
retweets, that kind of thing.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.551
And if you want your content
to get engagement,

00:03:36.575 --> 00:03:38.233
it has to spark emotion,

00:03:38.257 --> 00:03:41.757
specifically, what behavioral scientists
call "high-arousal emotion."

00:03:42.343 --> 00:03:44.833
Now, "high arousal" doesn't only
mean sexual arousal,

00:03:44.857 --> 00:03:47.592
although it's the internet,
obviously that works.

00:03:47.616 --> 00:03:51.625
It means anything, positive or negative,
that gets people's hearts pumping.

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:53.618
So I would sit with these propagandists,

00:03:53.642 --> 00:03:56.051
not just the guy in California,
but dozens of them,

00:03:56.075 --> 00:03:59.823
and I would watch as they did this
again and again successfully,

00:03:59.847 --> 00:04:03.455
not because they were Russian hackers,
not because they were tech prodigies,

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:05.768
not because they had
unique political insights --

00:04:05.772 --> 00:04:08.245
just because they understood
how social media worked,

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.851
and they were willing
to exploit it to their advantage.

00:04:10.865 --> 00:04:14.108
Now, at first I was able to tell myself
this was a fringe phenomenon,

00:04:14.132 --> 00:04:16.361
something that was
relegated to the internet.

00:04:16.385 --> 00:04:20.737
But there's really no separation anymore
between the internet and everything else.

00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:22.945
This is an ad that ran
on multiple TV stations

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:25.576
during the 2018 congressional elections,

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.480
alleging with very little evidence
that one of the candidates

00:04:28.504 --> 00:04:31.390
was in the pocket of
international manipulator George Soros,

00:04:31.414 --> 00:04:34.666
who is awkwardly photoshopped here
next to stacks of cash.

00:04:35.296 --> 00:04:37.950
This is a tweet from
the President of the United States,

00:04:37.974 --> 00:04:39.607
alleging, again with no evidence,

00:04:39.631 --> 00:04:43.062
that American politics is being
manipulated by George Soros.

00:04:43.086 --> 00:04:47.060
This stuff that once seemed so shocking
and marginal and, frankly, just ignorable,

00:04:47.084 --> 00:04:50.029
it's now so normalized
that we hardly even notice it.

00:04:50.053 --> 00:04:52.119
So I spent about
three years in this world.

00:04:52.143 --> 00:04:53.813
I talked to a lot of people.

00:04:53.837 --> 00:04:56.303
Some of them seemed to have
no core beliefs at all.

00:04:56.327 --> 00:04:58.910
They just seemed to be betting,
perfectly rationally,

00:04:58.934 --> 00:05:01.097
that if they wanted
to make some money online

00:05:01.121 --> 00:05:02.533
or get some attention online,

00:05:02.557 --> 00:05:04.770
they should just be
as outrageous as possible.

00:05:04.794 --> 00:05:07.383
But I talked to other people
who were true ideologues.

00:05:08.173 --> 00:05:12.054
And to be clear, their ideology
was not traditional conservatism.

00:05:12.078 --> 00:05:15.456
These were people who wanted
to revoke female suffrage.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.447
These were people who wanted
to go back to racial segregation.

00:05:18.471 --> 00:05:21.280
Some of them wanted to do away
with democracy altogether.

00:05:21.304 --> 00:05:24.416
Now, obviously these people
were not born believing these things.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.832
They didn't pick them up
in elementary school.

00:05:26.856 --> 00:05:29.848
A lot of them, before they went
down some internet rabbit hole,

00:05:29.872 --> 00:05:32.340
they had been libertarian
or they had been socialist

00:05:32.364 --> 00:05:34.551
or they had been something else entirely.

00:05:34.575 --> 00:05:35.866
So what was going on?

00:05:36.918 --> 00:05:38.980
Well, I can't generalize about every case,

00:05:39.004 --> 00:05:40.691
but a lot of the people I spoke to,

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:44.595
they seem to have a combination
of a high IQ and a low EQ.

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:48.130
They seem to take comfort
in anonymous, online spaces

00:05:48.154 --> 00:05:50.141
rather than connecting in the real world.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.263
So often they would retreat
to these message boards

00:05:53.287 --> 00:05:54.459
or these subreddits,

00:05:54.483 --> 00:05:56.937
where their worst impulses
would be magnified.

00:05:56.961 --> 00:06:00.020
They might start out saying
something just as a sick joke,

00:06:00.044 --> 00:06:03.388
and then they would get so much
positive reinforcement for that joke,

00:06:03.412 --> 00:06:06.233
so many meaningless
"internet points," as they called it,

00:06:06.257 --> 00:06:08.789
that they might start
believing their own joke.

00:06:10.014 --> 00:06:13.538
I talked a lot with one young woman
who grew up in New Jersey,

00:06:13.562 --> 00:06:16.038
and then after high school,
she moved to a new place

00:06:16.062 --> 00:06:18.316
and suddenly she just felt
alienated and cut off

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.204
and started retreating into her phone.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.022
She found some of these
spaces on the internet

00:06:23.046 --> 00:06:25.912
where people would post
the most shocking, heinous things.

00:06:25.936 --> 00:06:28.205
And she found this stuff
really off-putting

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:30.004
but also kind of engrossing,

00:06:30.754 --> 00:06:32.838
kind of like she couldn't
look away from it.

00:06:33.304 --> 00:06:36.136
She started interacting with people
in these online spaces,

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.959
and they made her feel smart,
they made her feel validated.

00:06:38.983 --> 00:06:40.960
She started feeling a sense of community,

00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:43.642
started wondering if maybe
some of these shocking memes

00:06:43.666 --> 00:06:46.127
might actually contain a kernel of truth.

00:06:46.151 --> 00:06:49.666
A few months later, she was in a car
with some of her new internet friends

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.516
headed to Charlottesville, Virginia,

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.228
to march with torches
in the name of the white race.

00:06:55.033 --> 00:06:57.324
She'd gone, in a few months,
from Obama supporter

00:06:57.338 --> 00:06:59.825
to fully radicalized white supremacist.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.311
Now, in her particular case,

00:07:03.335 --> 00:07:07.467
she actually was able to find her way
out of the cult of white supremacy.

00:07:08.418 --> 00:07:10.478
But a lot of the people
I spoke to were not.

00:07:10.502 --> 00:07:12.224
And just to be clear:

00:07:12.248 --> 00:07:15.214
I was never so convinced
that I had to find common ground

00:07:15.238 --> 00:07:17.301
with every single person I spoke to

00:07:17.325 --> 00:07:18.579
that I was willing to say,

00:07:18.603 --> 00:07:21.744
"You know what, man,
you're a fascist propagandist, I'm not,

00:07:21.768 --> 00:07:25.184
whatever, let's just hug it out,
all our differences will melt away."

00:07:25.208 --> 00:07:26.922
No, absolutely not.

00:07:28.056 --> 00:07:31.577
But I did become convinced that we cannot
just look away from this stuff.

00:07:31.601 --> 00:07:34.817
We have to try to understand it,
because only by understanding it

00:07:34.841 --> 00:07:38.039
can we even start to inoculate
ourselves against it.

00:07:39.361 --> 00:07:42.710
In my three years in this world,
I got a few nasty phone calls,

00:07:42.734 --> 00:07:44.254
even some threats,

00:07:44.278 --> 00:07:47.708
but it wasn't a fraction of what
female journalists get on this beat.

00:07:48.791 --> 00:07:50.182
And yeah, I am Jewish,

00:07:50.206 --> 00:07:53.855
although, weirdly, a lot of the Nazis
couldn't tell I was Jewish,

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:56.740
which I frankly just found
kind of disappointing.

00:07:56.764 --> 00:07:58.564
(Laughter)

00:07:58.588 --> 00:08:02.554
Seriously, like, your whole job
is being a professional anti-Semite.

00:08:03.228 --> 00:08:05.650
Nothing about me
is tipping you off at all?

00:08:05.674 --> 00:08:06.750
Nothing?

00:08:06.774 --> 00:08:09.077
(Laughter)

00:08:09.983 --> 00:08:11.178
This is not a secret.

00:08:11.202 --> 00:08:13.885
My name is Andrew Marantz,
I write for "The New Yorker,"

00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:16.430
my personality type
is like if a Seinfeld episode

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:18.291
was taped at the Park Slope Food Coop.

00:08:18.315 --> 00:08:19.477
Nothing?

00:08:19.501 --> 00:08:22.014
(Laughter)

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:27.035
Anyway, look -- ultimately,
it would be nice

00:08:27.059 --> 00:08:29.407
if there were, like, a simple formula:

00:08:29.431 --> 00:08:33.419
smartphone plus alienated kid
equals 12 percent chance of Nazi.

00:08:33.918 --> 00:08:35.522
It's obviously not that simple.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:37.353
And in my writing,

00:08:37.377 --> 00:08:40.592
I'm much more comfortable
being descriptive, not prescriptive.

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:43.690
But this is TED,

00:08:43.714 --> 00:08:45.701
so let's get practical.

00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:47.351
I want to share a few suggestions

00:08:47.375 --> 00:08:50.501
of things that citizens
of the internet like you and I

00:08:50.525 --> 00:08:53.662
might be able to do to make things
a little bit less toxic.

00:08:54.799 --> 00:08:57.099
So the first one is to be a smart skeptic.

00:08:57.964 --> 00:09:00.161
So, I think there are
two kinds of skepticism.

00:09:00.185 --> 00:09:04.413
And I don't want to drown you in technical
epistemological information here,

00:09:04.437 --> 00:09:07.065
but I call them smart and dumb skepticism.

00:09:08.176 --> 00:09:10.683
So, smart skepticism:

00:09:10.707 --> 00:09:11.911
thinking for yourself,

00:09:11.935 --> 00:09:13.127
questioning every claim,

00:09:13.151 --> 00:09:14.593
demanding evidence --

00:09:14.617 --> 00:09:16.334
great, that's real skepticism.

00:09:17.397 --> 00:09:20.027
Dumb skepticism:
it sounds like skepticism,

00:09:20.051 --> 00:09:23.042
but it's actually closer
to knee-jerk contrarianism.

00:09:23.817 --> 00:09:25.390
Everyone says the earth is round,

00:09:25.414 --> 00:09:26.770
you say it's flat.

00:09:26.794 --> 00:09:28.361
Everyone says racism is bad,

00:09:28.385 --> 00:09:30.970
you say, "I dunno,
I'm skeptical about that."

00:09:31.682 --> 00:09:35.801
I cannot tell you how many young white men
I have spoken to in the last few years

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:36.981
who have said,

00:09:37.005 --> 00:09:40.405
"You know, the media, my teachers,
they're all trying to indoctrinate me

00:09:40.429 --> 00:09:42.952
into believing in male privilege
and white privilege,

00:09:42.976 --> 00:09:45.428
but I don't know about that,
man, I don't think so."

00:09:45.452 --> 00:09:48.589
Guys -- contrarian
white teens of the world --

00:09:48.613 --> 00:09:50.731
look:

00:09:50.755 --> 00:09:54.468
if you are being a round earth skeptic
and a male privilege skeptic

00:09:54.492 --> 00:09:56.802
and a racism is bad skeptic,

00:09:56.826 --> 00:09:59.151
you're not being a skeptic,
you're being a jerk.

00:09:59.175 --> 00:10:02.768
(Applause)

00:10:04.394 --> 00:10:07.854
It's great to be independent-minded,
we all should be independent-minded,

00:10:07.878 --> 00:10:09.419
but just be smart about it.

00:10:09.906 --> 00:10:11.769
So this next one is about free speech.

00:10:11.793 --> 00:10:15.757
You will hear smart, accomplished people
who will say, "Well, I'm pro-free speech,"

00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:19.054
and they say it in this way
that it's like they're settling a debate,

00:10:19.078 --> 00:10:22.893
when actually, that is the very beginning
of any meaningful conversation.

00:10:23.554 --> 00:10:26.027
All the interesting stuff
happens after that point.

00:10:26.051 --> 00:10:28.355
OK, you're pro-free speech.
What does that mean?

00:10:28.379 --> 00:10:30.666
Does it mean that David Duke
and Richard Spencer

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.535
need to have active Twitter accounts?

00:10:32.888 --> 00:10:35.531
Does it mean that anyone
can harass anyone else online

00:10:35.555 --> 00:10:37.007
for any reason?

00:10:37.031 --> 00:10:40.319
You know, I looked through
the entire list of TED speakers this year.

00:10:40.343 --> 00:10:42.379
I didn't find a single
round earth skeptic.

00:10:42.403 --> 00:10:44.545
Is that a violation of free speech norms?

00:10:45.086 --> 00:10:48.628
Look, we're all pro-free speech,
it's wonderful to be pro-free speech,

00:10:48.652 --> 00:10:51.273
but if that's all you know
how to say again and again,

00:10:51.297 --> 00:10:54.288
you're standing in the way
of a more productive conversation.

00:10:56.105 --> 00:10:59.240
Making decency cool again, so ...

00:10:59.264 --> 00:11:00.462
Great!

00:11:00.486 --> 00:11:02.027
(Applause)

00:11:02.051 --> 00:11:04.157
Yeah. I don't even need to explain it.

00:11:04.181 --> 00:11:08.027
So in my research, I would go
to Reddit or YouTube or Facebook,

00:11:08.051 --> 00:11:10.351
and I would search for "sharia law"

00:11:10.375 --> 00:11:12.491
or I would search for "the Holocaust,"

00:11:12.515 --> 00:11:15.889
and you might be able to guess
what the algorithms showed me, right?

00:11:16.386 --> 00:11:19.316
"Is sharia law sweeping
across the United States?"

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.434
"Did the Holocaust really happen?"

00:11:22.291 --> 00:11:23.549
Dumb skepticism.

00:11:24.835 --> 00:11:27.216
So we've ended up in this
bizarre dynamic online,

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.332
where some people see bigoted propaganda

00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:32.022
as being edgy or being dangerous and cool,

00:11:32.046 --> 00:11:35.373
and people see basic truth
and human decency as pearl-clutching

00:11:35.397 --> 00:11:37.941
or virtue-signaling or just boring.

00:11:38.329 --> 00:11:41.618
And the social media algorithms,
whether intentionally or not,

00:11:41.642 --> 00:11:43.665
they have incentivized this,

00:11:43.689 --> 00:11:46.617
because bigoted propaganda
is great for engagement.

00:11:46.641 --> 00:11:48.907
Everyone clicks on it,
everyone comments on it,

00:11:48.931 --> 00:11:50.741
whether they love it or they hate it.

00:11:51.463 --> 00:11:53.751
So the number one thing
that has to happen here

00:11:53.775 --> 00:11:56.713
is social networks need
to fix their platforms.

00:11:57.069 --> 00:12:01.218
(Applause)

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.030
So if you're listening to my voice
and you work at a social media company

00:12:05.054 --> 00:12:07.518
or you invest in one
or, I don't know, own one,

00:12:08.598 --> 00:12:10.059
this tip is for you.

00:12:10.083 --> 00:12:14.004
If you have been optimizing
for maximum emotional engagement

00:12:14.028 --> 00:12:18.141
and maximum emotional engagement turns out
to be actively harming the world,

00:12:18.165 --> 00:12:20.701
it's time to optimize for something else.

00:12:20.725 --> 00:12:24.429
(Applause)

00:12:26.939 --> 00:12:30.452
But in addition to putting pressure
on them to do that

00:12:30.476 --> 00:12:33.110
and waiting for them
and hoping that they'll do that,

00:12:33.134 --> 00:12:35.636
there's some stuff that
the rest of us can do, too.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:40.157
So, we can create some better pathways
or suggest some better pathways

00:12:40.181 --> 00:12:42.172
for angsty teens to go down.

00:12:42.196 --> 00:12:45.475
If you see something that you think
is really creative and thoughtful

00:12:45.499 --> 00:12:48.298
and you want to share that thing,
you can share that thing,

00:12:48.322 --> 00:12:50.978
even if it's not flooding you
with high arousal emotion.

00:12:51.002 --> 00:12:53.022
Now that is a very small step, I realize,

00:12:53.046 --> 00:12:55.230
but in the aggregate,
this stuff does matter,

00:12:55.254 --> 00:12:57.660
because these algorithms,
as powerful as they are,

00:12:57.684 --> 00:12:59.889
they are taking their
behavioral cues from us.

00:13:01.556 --> 00:13:03.069
So let me leave you with this.

00:13:03.701 --> 00:13:06.190
You know, a few years ago
it was really fashionable

00:13:06.214 --> 00:13:08.527
to say that the internet
was a revolutionary tool

00:13:08.551 --> 00:13:10.563
that was going to bring us all together.

00:13:11.074 --> 00:13:12.663
It's now more fashionable to say

00:13:12.687 --> 00:13:15.781
that the internet is a huge,
irredeemable dumpster fire.

00:13:16.787 --> 00:13:18.619
Neither caricature is really true.

00:13:18.643 --> 00:13:21.016
We know the internet
is just too vast and complex

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.539
to be all good or all bad.

00:13:22.563 --> 00:13:24.650
And the danger with
these ways of thinking,

00:13:24.674 --> 00:13:28.137
whether it's the utopian view
that the internet will inevitably save us

00:13:28.161 --> 00:13:31.609
or the dystopian view that it
will inevitably destroy us,

00:13:31.633 --> 00:13:34.077
either way, we're letting
ourselves off the hook.

00:13:35.564 --> 00:13:38.170
There is nothing inevitable
about our future.

00:13:38.878 --> 00:13:40.879
The internet is made of people.

00:13:40.903 --> 00:13:43.887
People make decisions
at social media companies.

00:13:43.911 --> 00:13:46.562
People make hashtags trend or not trend.

00:13:46.586 --> 00:13:49.715
People make societies progress or regress.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.655
When we internalize that fact,

00:13:52.679 --> 00:13:55.727
we can stop waiting
for some inevitable future to arrive

00:13:55.751 --> 00:13:57.415
and actually get to work now.

00:13:58.842 --> 00:14:02.361
You know, we've all been taught
that the arc of the moral universe is long

00:14:02.385 --> 00:14:04.087
but that it bends toward justice.

00:14:06.489 --> 00:14:07.719
Maybe.

00:14:08.814 --> 00:14:10.014
Maybe it will.

00:14:10.776 --> 00:14:13.253
But that has always been an aspiration.

00:14:13.277 --> 00:14:14.848
It is not a guarantee.

00:14:15.856 --> 00:14:18.021
The arc doesn't bend itself.

00:14:18.045 --> 00:14:21.720
It's not bent inevitably
by some mysterious force.

00:14:21.744 --> 00:14:23.416
The real truth,

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.831
which is scarier and also more liberating,

00:14:26.847 --> 00:14:28.062
is that we bend it.

00:14:28.943 --> 00:14:30.152
Thank you.

00:14:30.176 --> 00:14:32.793
(Applause)
