Lindsay Levin: So Dave,
in just a few months,

00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:18.888
you transition into a new role
as CEO of consumer retail at Amazon.

00:00:18.912 --> 00:00:20.431
That's a big role.

00:00:20.455 --> 00:00:22.950
How will climate sit
as a priority for you,

00:00:22.974 --> 00:00:25.493
given all the other things
you'll have on your plate?

00:00:25.517 --> 00:00:28.588
Dave Clark: We've spent
much of our end of the summer

00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:30.627
in smoke-filled Seattle,

00:00:30.651 --> 00:00:35.406
unable to enjoy the majestic
Pacific Northwest due to all the fires

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.643
that encompassed the West Coast
of the US this summer.

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:44.676
Climate is a very real challenge
for all of us, not just at Amazon,

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.066
but in our daily lives at this point.

00:00:47.794 --> 00:00:51.599
And I've been focused on this
with the team and with Kara for years now.

00:00:51.623 --> 00:00:54.718
In fact, we've embedded
the sustainability teams

00:00:54.742 --> 00:00:56.818
inside of our operations team,

00:00:56.842 --> 00:00:59.368
as opposed to being
a separate part of the company,

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:02.612
because we wanted those teams
connected with the groups

00:01:02.636 --> 00:01:04.527
that can actually make change.

00:01:04.551 --> 00:01:07.801
LL: Kara, can you describe
a couple of the biggest hurdles you face

00:01:07.825 --> 00:01:09.831
as you work to reduce
the carbon footprint

00:01:09.855 --> 00:01:11.089
of a company like Amazon?

00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:14.858
Kara Hurst: One of the really exciting
but also complex things about Amazon

00:01:14.882 --> 00:01:17.385
is the diversity
of businesses that we're in,

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.674
the range of services and products,

00:01:19.698 --> 00:01:22.866
of industries and different types
of buildings and stores

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.101
and fulfillment centers,

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:28.537
and of course, all of our online
infrastructure and business as well.

00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:31.797
And we're committed to reaching
net zero emissions.

00:01:31.821 --> 00:01:35.428
I think our size and our scale
can actually be a tremendous advantage.

00:01:35.452 --> 00:01:37.893
It forces us to think about
our carbon footprint

00:01:37.917 --> 00:01:39.537
throughout all of our businesses,

00:01:39.561 --> 00:01:43.694
our operations, our technologies,
our services, our products.

00:01:43.718 --> 00:01:44.902
And at one end,

00:01:44.926 --> 00:01:49.627
we want to power our operations
by 100 percent renewable energy by 2025,

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:52.640
but we're also making sure
that when you receive a shipment,

00:01:52.664 --> 00:01:56.340
we're at net zero carbon
all the way through those operations.

00:01:56.364 --> 00:01:59.159
And we want to do this
in a very Amazonian way.

00:01:59.183 --> 00:02:03.335
So we took a number of years to build
what we call "a carbon system of record."

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:06.728
These are tools that allow us
to think about this holistically

00:02:06.752 --> 00:02:08.161
across the company.

00:02:08.185 --> 00:02:09.896
LL: Dave, Amazon has made a pledge,

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.572
you call it "the Climate Pledge,"

00:02:11.596 --> 00:02:14.160
to be net zero across
your business by 2040.

00:02:14.184 --> 00:02:16.579
That's 10 years ahead
of the Paris Agreement.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.820
Give us a sense of the scale
of transformation that that calls for

00:02:20.844 --> 00:02:22.731
across your operations.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.028
DC: It's very daunting.

00:02:25.052 --> 00:02:26.782
When we started this process,

00:02:26.806 --> 00:02:28.861
we started from a position of science,

00:02:28.885 --> 00:02:32.323
of digging in and understanding
all the inputs of our business,

00:02:32.347 --> 00:02:36.056
what parts of our business create
and put carbon into the environment,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.128
what are the elements,
each piece of that process,

00:02:39.152 --> 00:02:41.085
and how do we improve them.

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:42.772
And as we started looking at that,

00:02:42.796 --> 00:02:45.501
we said, well, how are we going
to meet these objectives?

00:02:45.525 --> 00:02:49.981
And it really requires innovation across
almost every aspect of the business,

00:02:50.005 --> 00:02:52.666
whether it be in our renewable space,

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.272
whether it be in electrification
of our vehicles,

00:02:55.296 --> 00:02:57.545
whether it be in
our packaging and processes,

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.589
whether it be working with manufacturers.

00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:02.494
Essentially, the entire span
of our supply chain

00:03:02.518 --> 00:03:05.881
is required to modify to meet
the objectives of this over time,

00:03:05.905 --> 00:03:08.260
which is why the Climate Pledge
was so important.

00:03:08.284 --> 00:03:10.839
LL: Kara, the Climate Pledge
is not just about Amazon.

00:03:10.863 --> 00:03:13.099
You're inviting other
companies to join you.

00:03:13.123 --> 00:03:16.182
KH: We know with the Climate Pledge
we cannot do this alone.

00:03:16.206 --> 00:03:18.126
It's going to take companies,

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.766
but partnership also with governments
and communities and individuals

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.928
who will come up with solutions
and new technologies.

00:03:24.952 --> 00:03:27.974
We want to engage our full supply chain

00:03:27.998 --> 00:03:29.439
as well as other companies,

00:03:29.463 --> 00:03:33.185
and we're really excited
that already 11 major organizations

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.650
have signed on to
the Climate Pledge with us.

00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:37.499
We want to accelerate innovation,

00:03:37.523 --> 00:03:40.879
and we've established
a two-billion-dollar Climate Pledge Fund

00:03:40.903 --> 00:03:42.988
to invest in these companies

00:03:43.012 --> 00:03:46.021
whose products and solutions
will facilitate the transition

00:03:46.045 --> 00:03:47.721
to a low-carbon economy.

00:03:47.745 --> 00:03:50.290
So we know this is
a very ambitious challenge,

00:03:50.314 --> 00:03:54.634
but we want to make the greatest impact
in the shortest possible timeline,

00:03:54.658 --> 00:03:58.907
and it's exciting to share the complexity
about how we think about this at Amazon

00:03:58.931 --> 00:04:00.083
with other companies

00:04:00.107 --> 00:04:02.258
and invite them to come along with us.

00:04:02.282 --> 00:04:04.495
LL: Dave, when
a company like Amazon moves,

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.134
it can have a huge impact
across supply chains.

00:04:07.158 --> 00:04:10.841
Give us an example or two
of how a decision that you've made

00:04:10.865 --> 00:04:15.704
is catalyzing innovation
across the sector.

00:04:15.728 --> 00:04:18.490
DC: I can tell you,
just the example of Rivian.

00:04:18.514 --> 00:04:21.751
Rivian is the electric
vehicle manufacturer

00:04:21.775 --> 00:04:24.979
that is going to build 100,000
electric delivery vehicles

00:04:25.003 --> 00:04:26.214
for our delivery fleet.

00:04:26.238 --> 00:04:28.298
When we went out and made this investment,

00:04:28.322 --> 00:04:31.928
the number of new companies
that started to spawn

00:04:31.952 --> 00:04:34.429
relative to supporting Rivian,

00:04:34.453 --> 00:04:37.448
to new electric delivery vehicles,

00:04:37.472 --> 00:04:39.028
to even alternative fuels --

00:04:39.052 --> 00:04:42.398
we started getting calls
about alternative jet fuel

00:04:42.422 --> 00:04:44.966
the day we put out
that announcement on Rivian.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.455
So as soon as people saw
that we were going to invest real capital

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.710
for substantive portions
of our operations --

00:04:51.734 --> 00:04:53.010
these aren't hobbies,

00:04:53.034 --> 00:04:58.076
but putting real money
into big pieces of our operations --

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.899
it was amazing, the amount of companies
that started coming out

00:05:02.923 --> 00:05:04.905
who had an emergent technology here

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:09.610
or had a great idea and needed help
in getting manufacturing started.

00:05:09.634 --> 00:05:12.364
There was just example
after example of those.

00:05:12.388 --> 00:05:14.847
LL: Dave, Kara, thank you so much
for being with us.

00:05:14.871 --> 00:05:17.220
We wish you every success
with the Climate Pledge

00:05:17.244 --> 00:05:20.495
and really can't wait to see the progress
you guys are going to make.

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:24.183
DC: Thank you, it's an honor to be here
and be part of such an amazing event.

00:05:24.207 --> 00:05:25.595
KH: Thank you.
