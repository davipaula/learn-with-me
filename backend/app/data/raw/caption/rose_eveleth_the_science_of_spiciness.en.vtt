00:00:06.951 --> 00:00:08.951
Why does your mouth feel like it's on fire

00:00:08.951 --> 00:00:10.914
when you eat a spicy pepper?

00:00:10.914 --> 00:00:12.783
And how do you soothe the burn?

00:00:12.783 --> 00:00:14.836
Why does wasabi make your eyes water?

00:00:14.836 --> 00:00:18.283
And how spicy is the spiciest spice?

00:00:18.283 --> 00:00:19.366
Let's back up a bit.

00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.802
First, what is spiciness?

00:00:21.802 --> 00:00:24.815
Even though we often say that something tastes spicy,

00:00:24.815 --> 00:00:26.597
it's not actually a taste,

00:00:26.597 --> 00:00:28.851
like sweet or salty or sour.

00:00:28.851 --> 00:00:30.142
Instead, what's really happening

00:00:30.142 --> 00:00:31.978
is that certain compounds in spicy foods

00:00:31.978 --> 00:00:33.811
activate the type of sensory neurons

00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:36.861
called polymodal nociceptors.

00:00:36.861 --> 00:00:38.570
You have these all over your body,

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.467
including your mouth and nose,

00:00:40.467 --> 00:00:41.977
and they're the same receptors

00:00:41.977 --> 00:00:44.323
that are activated by extreme heat.

00:00:44.323 --> 00:00:45.780
So, when you eat a chili pepper,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.448
your mouth feels like it's burning

00:00:47.448 --> 00:00:50.329
because your brain actually thinks it's burning.

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:51.912
The opposite happens when you eat something

00:00:51.912 --> 00:00:53.417
with menthol in it.

00:00:53.417 --> 00:00:54.695
The cool, minty compound

00:00:54.695 --> 00:00:56.947
is activating your cold receptors.

00:00:56.947 --> 00:00:58.797
When these heat-sensitive receptors are activated,

00:00:58.797 --> 00:01:00.300
your body thinks it's in contact

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.633
with a dangerous heat source

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:03.029
and reacts accordingly.

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:04.511
This is why you start to sweat,

00:01:04.511 --> 00:01:06.178
and your heart starts beating faster.

00:01:06.178 --> 00:01:07.390
The peppers have elicited

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.766
the same fight-or-flight response

00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:11.184
with which your body reacts to most threats.

00:01:11.184 --> 00:01:12.540
But you may have noticed that

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.397
not all spicy foods are spicy in the same way.

00:01:15.397 --> 00:01:18.528
And the difference lies in the types of compounds involved.

00:01:18.528 --> 00:01:20.234
The capsaicin and piperine,

00:01:20.234 --> 00:01:21.986
found in black pepper and chili peppers,

00:01:21.986 --> 00:01:23.987
are made up of larger, heavier molecules

00:01:23.987 --> 00:01:25.657
called alkylamides,

00:01:25.657 --> 00:01:27.575
and those mostly stay in your mouth.

00:01:27.575 --> 00:01:29.577
Mustard, horseradish, and wasabi

00:01:29.577 --> 00:01:31.279
are made up of smaller molecules,

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:33.529
called isothiocyanates,

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:36.279
that easily float up into your sinuses.

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:38.362
This is why chili peppers burn your mouth,

00:01:38.362 --> 00:01:41.447
and wasabi burns your nose.

00:01:41.447 --> 00:01:42.967
The standard measure of a food's spiciness

00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:44.716
is its rating on the Scoville scale,

00:01:44.716 --> 00:01:47.954
which measures how much its capsaicin content can be diluted

00:01:47.954 --> 00:01:50.557
before the heat is no longer detectable to humans.

00:01:50.557 --> 00:01:53.184
A sweet bell pepper gets 0 Scoville heat units,

00:01:53.184 --> 00:01:57.863
while Tabasco sauce clocks in between 1,200-2,400 units.

00:01:57.863 --> 00:01:59.400
The race to create the hottest pepper

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.861
is a constant battle,

00:02:00.861 --> 00:02:02.985
but two peppers generally come out on top:

00:02:02.985 --> 00:02:05.071
The Trinidad Moruga Scorpion

00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:06.740
and the Carolina Reaper.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.112
These peppers measure

00:02:08.112 --> 00:02:10.993
between 1.5 and 2 million Scoville heat units,

00:02:10.993 --> 00:02:14.695
which is about half the units found in pepper spray.

00:02:14.695 --> 00:02:16.446
So, why would anyone want to eat something

00:02:16.446 --> 00:02:19.196
that causes such high levels of pain?

00:02:19.196 --> 00:02:21.170
Nobody really knows when or why

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.214
humans started eating hot peppers.

00:02:23.214 --> 00:02:25.299
Archaeologists have found spices like mustard

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.177
along with human artifacts

00:02:27.177 --> 00:02:29.053
dating as far back as 23,000 years ago.

00:02:29.053 --> 00:02:30.804
But they don't know whether the spices were used

00:02:30.804 --> 00:02:34.029
for food or medication or just decoration.

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:35.810
More recently, a 6,000 year old crockpot,

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.862
lined with charred fish and meat,

00:02:37.862 --> 00:02:39.522
also contained mustard.

00:02:39.522 --> 00:02:41.148
One theory says that humans

00:02:41.148 --> 00:02:42.400
starting adding spices to food

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.944
to kill off bacteria.

00:02:43.944 --> 00:02:46.198
And some studies show that spice developed

00:02:46.198 --> 00:02:47.612
mostly in warmer climates

00:02:47.612 --> 00:02:50.279
where microbes also happen to be more prevalent.

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:52.696
But why we continue to subject ourselves

00:02:52.696 --> 00:02:53.947
to spicy food today

00:02:53.947 --> 00:02:55.612
is still a bit of a mystery.

00:02:55.612 --> 00:02:56.619
For some people,

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:57.696
eating spicy food

00:02:57.696 --> 00:02:58.917
is like riding rollercoasters;

00:02:58.917 --> 00:03:00.446
they enjoy the ensuing thrill,

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:03.446
even if the immediate sensation is unpleasant.

00:03:03.446 --> 00:03:04.756
Some studies have even shown

00:03:04.756 --> 00:03:06.215
that those who like to eat hot stuff

00:03:06.215 --> 00:03:08.926
are more likely to enjoy other adrenaline-rich activities,

00:03:08.926 --> 00:03:10.554
like gambling.

00:03:10.554 --> 00:03:11.969
The taste for spicy food

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:13.598
may even be genetic.

00:03:13.598 --> 00:03:15.558
And if you're thinking about training a bit,

00:03:15.558 --> 00:03:17.059
to up your tolerance for spice,

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:18.112
know this:

00:03:18.112 --> 00:03:19.396
According to some studies,

00:03:19.396 --> 00:03:21.231
the pain doesn't get any better.

00:03:21.231 --> 00:03:22.946
You just get tougher.

00:03:22.946 --> 00:03:24.612
In fact, researchers have found

00:03:24.612 --> 00:03:26.445
that people who like to eat spicy foods

00:03:26.445 --> 00:03:29.029
don't rate the burn any less painful

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:30.612
than those who don't.

00:03:30.612 --> 00:03:33.363
They just seem to like the pain more.

00:03:33.363 --> 00:03:35.111
So, torment your heat receptors all you want,

00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:37.413
but remember, when it comes to spicy food,

00:03:37.413 --> 00:03:39.029
you're going to get burned.
