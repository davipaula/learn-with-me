00:00:12.786 --> 00:00:18.310
It is hard to overstate
the beneficial effects of immunization.

00:00:18.937 --> 00:00:22.156
According to the US
Centers for Disease Control,

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.696
US children born over the last 20 years --

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.236
for those children, vaccines will prevent
greater than 322 million illnesses,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.164
greater than 21 million hospitalizations

00:00:34.188 --> 00:00:37.839
and greater than 730,000 deaths,

00:00:37.863 --> 00:00:42.807
with the societal cost savings
of nearly 1.4 trillion dollars.

00:00:43.362 --> 00:00:44.831
Those are big numbers.

00:00:44.855 --> 00:00:47.406
But let's zoom in
and look at a particular example.

00:00:47.976 --> 00:00:50.135
Vaccines have nearly eliminated

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:53.539
a bacterial infection
called Haemophilus influenzae.

00:00:53.563 --> 00:00:56.826
This bacterium
used to infect young infants

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.379
causing bloodstream infections,

00:00:58.403 --> 00:01:01.355
pneumonia, meningitis, death

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.979
or permanent disability.

00:01:03.585 --> 00:01:06.696
As a young pediatrician,
I saw a few cases.

00:01:07.085 --> 00:01:10.045
You folks probably have never
heard of this disease,

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:12.712
because vaccines have been so effective.

00:01:12.736 --> 00:01:14.806
You could see in the graph on the right

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.997
that since the introduction of vaccines,

00:01:17.021 --> 00:01:19.926
the incidence of Haemophilus
bacterial infections

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.386
has plummeted like a rock,
and it's nearly vanished.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.736
So vaccines are generally a success story.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.627
But we also face challenges.

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:33.240
For one, for most vaccines,
we need to give multiple doses

00:01:33.264 --> 00:01:35.685
to achieve or maintain protection.

00:01:36.725 --> 00:01:41.050
The scientific community is working
on developing single-shot vaccines.

00:01:41.074 --> 00:01:44.832
Imagine being able to get only one
influenza shot your whole life

00:01:44.856 --> 00:01:47.657
and not having to get
a seasonal flu vaccine.

00:01:48.197 --> 00:01:51.943
Certain microbes
are difficult to immunize against.

00:01:51.967 --> 00:01:56.191
A classic example is human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV.

00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:59.372
The need is urgent,
progress is being made;

00:01:59.396 --> 00:02:00.572
we're not there yet.

00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:05.069
Another critical element
in vaccine research right now

00:02:05.093 --> 00:02:08.514
is optimizing vaccines
for the most vulnerable among us,

00:02:08.538 --> 00:02:10.633
the very young and the elderly.

00:02:10.657 --> 00:02:13.257
And this is an active area of research.

00:02:13.982 --> 00:02:18.204
Finally, one of the biggest challenges
we unfortunately face right now

00:02:18.228 --> 00:02:20.355
are anti-vax attitudes.

00:02:20.895 --> 00:02:27.014
In fact, it's alarming that over 100,000
infants and children in the United States

00:02:27.038 --> 00:02:28.998
have not received any vaccines,

00:02:29.022 --> 00:02:30.822
and that number is growing.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.545
In fact, the World Health
Organization, or WHO,

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.181
has declared anti-vax attitudes

00:02:37.205 --> 00:02:41.403
as one of the 10 most important
threats to human health

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:43.022
in the world today.

00:02:43.046 --> 00:02:47.410
This graphic illustrates
the spread of anti-vax sentiment

00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:48.966
in the state of California,

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.022
from the year 2000 to 2013,

00:02:52.046 --> 00:02:55.601
by looking at the percentage
of public kindergarten students

00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:59.940
who claim the personal exemption
against immunization.

00:03:00.337 --> 00:03:02.845
Anti-vax sentiment is on the rise,

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:05.257
and it has very real consequences.

00:03:05.281 --> 00:03:07.355
Many of you may be aware of the fact

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.561
that we're seeing infections
that we thought we conquered long ago

00:03:10.585 --> 00:03:11.736
coming back.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.363
Measles outbreaks have been reported
in multiple US states.

00:03:15.387 --> 00:03:16.783
And many have forgotten,

00:03:16.807 --> 00:03:20.188
but measles is very
infectious and dangerous.

00:03:20.498 --> 00:03:24.299
Just a few viral particles
can infect an individual.

00:03:24.743 --> 00:03:26.815
And there have been even reports

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:29.259
at sporting events
and at an Olympic stadium

00:03:29.283 --> 00:03:31.973
where the virus, through the air,
travels long distances

00:03:31.997 --> 00:03:34.980
and infects a vulnerable
person in the crowd.

00:03:35.288 --> 00:03:37.399
In fact, if I had
a measles cough right now,

00:03:37.423 --> 00:03:38.580
(Coughs)

00:03:38.604 --> 00:03:42.747
somebody in the back
of this auditorium could get infected.

00:03:43.903 --> 00:03:47.268
And this has had
very real-world consequences.

00:03:47.292 --> 00:03:48.482
Just a few months ago,

00:03:48.506 --> 00:03:52.169
an airline stewardess
contracted measles on a flight,

00:03:52.193 --> 00:03:55.264
the virus entered her brain
and caused encephalitis,

00:03:55.288 --> 00:03:56.573
and she died.

00:03:56.597 --> 00:04:00.145
So people are now dying
due to this anti-vax sentiment.

00:04:01.168 --> 00:04:02.974
I do want to take a few minutes

00:04:02.998 --> 00:04:05.443
to address those
who don't believe in vaccines

00:04:05.467 --> 00:04:07.386
and who resist vaccines.

00:04:08.315 --> 00:04:13.220
As a pediatrician who receives
my yearly flu vaccination,

00:04:13.244 --> 00:04:15.297
as a parent of three children

00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:19.612
who have been vaccinated according
to the recommended schedule,

00:04:19.636 --> 00:04:22.413
and as a pediatric infectious
disease consultant

00:04:22.437 --> 00:04:25.279
who has taken care
of young children with meningitis

00:04:25.303 --> 00:04:29.156
that would have been preventable
had their parents accepted immunization,

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.101
this is a personal matter to me.

00:04:31.496 --> 00:04:34.289
Let's take a look
at who is going to pay the price

00:04:34.313 --> 00:04:38.336
if we start dialing back the amount
of vaccination in our society.

00:04:38.686 --> 00:04:41.093
This graph depicts, on the Y axis,

00:04:41.117 --> 00:04:44.561
the number of individuals
dying of infection in the world.

00:04:44.585 --> 00:04:46.079
And on the X axis,

00:04:46.103 --> 00:04:48.617
the age of the individuals who are dying.

00:04:48.641 --> 00:04:52.061
And as you can see,
it's very much a U-shaped distribution,

00:04:52.085 --> 00:04:55.291
and it's particularly stark
in the very young ages.

00:04:55.855 --> 00:04:59.901
So vaccines shield
the very young from infection.

00:05:00.528 --> 00:05:03.591
And if we want to talk, my friends,
about what vaccines cause,

00:05:03.615 --> 00:05:05.385
because there's a lot of speculation,

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:09.014
unfounded speculation on the internet,
of what vaccines cause,

00:05:09.038 --> 00:05:12.593
vaccines cause adults, OK?

00:05:12.617 --> 00:05:13.783
That's what they cause.

00:05:13.807 --> 00:05:18.713
And the other thing that they cause
is for elderly individuals to live longer.

00:05:18.737 --> 00:05:21.137
Because they are shielded
against influenza

00:05:21.161 --> 00:05:23.361
and other killers of the elderly.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.729
Now, let's talk a little bit

00:05:25.753 --> 00:05:28.204
about how we can improve
vaccines even further.

00:05:28.228 --> 00:05:32.656
We can create vaccines that can immunize
the most vulnerable among us

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.045
and perhaps even vaccines
that protect with single shots.

00:05:36.363 --> 00:05:38.879
Let me go over a little bit
of the immunology.

00:05:38.903 --> 00:05:42.315
In the top panel, what you see
is a simple vaccine.

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:45.237
All vaccines contain
something called an antigen.

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:48.499
The antigen is like a piece
of a germ, of a microbe,

00:05:48.523 --> 00:05:50.412
that your body remembers, right?

00:05:50.436 --> 00:05:53.888
It forms antibodies
and those antibodies can protect you.

00:05:53.912 --> 00:05:57.307
So those kind of vaccines
can induce an immune response,

00:05:57.331 --> 00:05:58.664
but as you see here,

00:05:58.688 --> 00:06:01.608
that immune response
tends to go up and back down,

00:06:01.632 --> 00:06:04.339
and you need to get another dose
and another dose

00:06:04.363 --> 00:06:06.172
to maintain protection.

00:06:06.196 --> 00:06:07.346
What can we do?

00:06:07.836 --> 00:06:10.011
We and other scientists around the world

00:06:10.035 --> 00:06:13.336
are finding molecules
that can boost a vaccine response.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.296
Those are called adjuvants,

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.212
from the Latin "adjuvare," to help or aid.

00:06:18.236 --> 00:06:21.323
Adjuvants are molecules
we might add to a vaccine

00:06:21.347 --> 00:06:23.045
to get a stronger response.

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:26.364
And in the presence of the adjuvant,
depicted here in red,

00:06:26.388 --> 00:06:29.744
you have a much more profound
activation of the white blood cells

00:06:29.768 --> 00:06:31.037
of your immune system,

00:06:31.061 --> 00:06:33.950
and generate a much more
profound immune response,

00:06:33.974 --> 00:06:36.735
with much higher antibody
levels, more rapidly,

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:39.775
and that lasts a long time
for durable immunity.

00:06:40.093 --> 00:06:43.561
Interestingly, these adjuvants
have different effects

00:06:43.585 --> 00:06:47.212
depending on the age or other demographic
factors of the individual.

00:06:47.665 --> 00:06:50.861
Which brings me to the notion
of precision vaccines.

00:06:51.211 --> 00:06:55.187
This is the idea that we will take
precision medicine --

00:06:55.211 --> 00:06:57.227
you know what precision
medicine is, right,

00:06:57.251 --> 00:06:59.775
that's the idea that populations may vary

00:06:59.799 --> 00:07:02.244
in their response
to a particular medicine --

00:07:02.268 --> 00:07:04.370
and apply that to vaccines.

00:07:04.784 --> 00:07:05.934
Right?

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.142
And here in Boston Children's Hospital

00:07:08.166 --> 00:07:10.775
at the Precision Vaccines
Program I direct,

00:07:10.799 --> 00:07:14.061
we have five approaches,
stepwise approaches we take,

00:07:14.085 --> 00:07:15.594
to build precision vaccines

00:07:15.618 --> 00:07:18.466
that are tailored
to vulnerable populations.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.727
Number one,

00:07:19.751 --> 00:07:22.879
we need to understand
what the attitude of a given population is

00:07:22.903 --> 00:07:24.063
towards a vaccine.

00:07:24.087 --> 00:07:26.910
You could build the most
sophisticated vaccine in the world,

00:07:26.934 --> 00:07:29.454
but if nobody wants to take it,
you're going nowhere.

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:30.910
Number two,

00:07:30.934 --> 00:07:33.214
we have to think
of the route of immunization.

00:07:33.238 --> 00:07:36.349
Most vaccines are intramuscular, or IM,

00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:39.483
but there are others,
intranasal, oral and others.

00:07:40.142 --> 00:07:43.363
Then, as I just described to you,
vaccines have components.

00:07:43.387 --> 00:07:45.299
All vaccines have an antigen,

00:07:45.323 --> 00:07:48.077
that's the part of the microbe
that your body remembers,

00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:51.990
that you might make antibodies
or cell-mediated immunity against.

00:07:52.014 --> 00:07:54.300
And we might add an adjuvant,
as we talked about,

00:07:54.324 --> 00:07:55.918
to boost an immune response.

00:07:55.942 --> 00:07:57.100
But guess what?

00:07:57.124 --> 00:07:59.425
There are many different
antigens to choose from

00:07:59.449 --> 00:08:00.839
and many different adjuvants.

00:08:00.863 --> 00:08:02.728
How are we going to make that decision?

00:08:02.752 --> 00:08:04.831
And the menu of these keeps growing.

00:08:04.855 --> 00:08:06.006
So on our team,

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:09.514
we've developed ways
to test vaccines outside the body --

00:08:09.538 --> 00:08:11.180
in Latin, that's "in vitro" --

00:08:11.204 --> 00:08:12.823
in a tissue culture dish.

00:08:12.847 --> 00:08:16.125
So we use tissue engineering
with blood cells

00:08:16.149 --> 00:08:18.252
to immunize outside the body

00:08:18.276 --> 00:08:20.332
and study the effect of the vaccine

00:08:20.356 --> 00:08:24.696
against, for example, infants
or elderly individuals or others.

00:08:25.347 --> 00:08:27.564
And if you think about it,
this is critical,

00:08:27.588 --> 00:08:31.185
because if you look at all the infections
we want to build vaccines against,

00:08:31.209 --> 00:08:35.170
like Zika virus and Ebola virus
and HIV and others,

00:08:35.194 --> 00:08:36.988
all the candidate antigens,

00:08:37.012 --> 00:08:39.115
all the candidate adjuvants,

00:08:39.139 --> 00:08:41.115
all the different populations,

00:08:41.139 --> 00:08:44.879
it's going to be impossible to do
large, phase III clinical trials

00:08:44.903 --> 00:08:46.466
for every combination.

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:50.712
This is where we think being able
to test vaccines outside the body

00:08:50.736 --> 00:08:54.187
can make a big difference
to accelerate vaccine development.

00:08:54.497 --> 00:08:57.394
And finally, this whole effort
is to drive an immune response

00:08:57.418 --> 00:09:00.671
that will protect against
that particular pathogen,

00:09:00.695 --> 00:09:04.575
getting antibodies and other cells
to defend the body.

00:09:05.273 --> 00:09:07.900
We are also using additional
innovative approaches

00:09:07.924 --> 00:09:11.329
to bring the most cutting-edge science
to vaccine development.

00:09:11.353 --> 00:09:15.450
We're taking a deeper dive
as to how current vaccines protect.

00:09:15.474 --> 00:09:17.823
We've formed an international consortium

00:09:17.847 --> 00:09:21.586
to study how hepatitis B vaccine
protects newborns

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:23.500
from hepatitis B infection.

00:09:23.524 --> 00:09:24.675
And to do this,

00:09:24.699 --> 00:09:28.103
we've developed a technique
called small sample, big data.

00:09:28.127 --> 00:09:32.191
We can get a tiny little drop
of baby blood before immunization,

00:09:32.215 --> 00:09:35.313
and take a tiny little drop
after immunization,

00:09:35.337 --> 00:09:38.225
and we can measure the inventory
of all the cells,

00:09:38.249 --> 00:09:41.615
and all the genes and all the molecules
in that drop of blood,

00:09:41.639 --> 00:09:43.861
and we can compare after the vaccine

00:09:43.885 --> 00:09:46.363
to before the vaccine in that same baby

00:09:46.387 --> 00:09:48.252
and understand in a deep way

00:09:48.276 --> 00:09:51.355
exactly how that successful
vaccine protects.

00:09:51.745 --> 00:09:56.537
And those lessons we can use
to build the next vaccines in the future.

00:09:56.561 --> 00:09:59.966
So this diagram is really illustrating
a tiny drop of blood

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:02.307
yielding huge amounts of information,

00:10:02.331 --> 00:10:04.180
tens of thousands of analytes,

00:10:04.204 --> 00:10:08.708
and that hairball is meant to depict
the gene pathways that are turned on

00:10:08.732 --> 00:10:11.112
and the molecular pathways
that are turned on.

00:10:11.136 --> 00:10:14.295
So much more to come on that,
and very exciting science.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.700
So we are partnering
with scientists around the world

00:10:17.724 --> 00:10:21.842
to bring all these new technologies
to invigorate vaccine development

00:10:21.866 --> 00:10:23.921
in a Precision Vaccines network.

00:10:23.945 --> 00:10:26.441
We are going to advance
personalized vaccines

00:10:26.465 --> 00:10:29.017
for vulnerable populations
around the world.

00:10:29.041 --> 00:10:33.923
Our team includes scientists,
technical experts and physicians.

00:10:33.947 --> 00:10:36.749
And we're developing vaccines
against infectious diseases

00:10:36.773 --> 00:10:39.177
like pertussis, which is whooping cough.

00:10:39.201 --> 00:10:41.108
We have a whooping cough vaccine,

00:10:41.132 --> 00:10:43.062
but it requires multiple doses,

00:10:43.086 --> 00:10:44.617
and the immunity keeps dropping.

00:10:44.641 --> 00:10:47.387
We want to develop a single-shot
pertussis vaccine.

00:10:47.411 --> 00:10:50.315
We're working on a vaccine
for respiratory syncytial virus,

00:10:50.339 --> 00:10:54.006
the number one cause of infant
hospitalization in the United States.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.710
A better vaccine against influenza,

00:10:56.734 --> 00:10:59.029
and, of course, HIV.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:03.371
We're also looking at vaccines
against cancer, allergy

00:11:03.395 --> 00:11:06.553
and, interestingly, opioid overdose.

00:11:07.815 --> 00:11:10.609
So, this is my final message to you.

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:14.276
Vaccines protect you and your loved ones

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:15.712
and the people around you.

00:11:15.736 --> 00:11:17.942
Not only do they protect you
against infection,

00:11:17.966 --> 00:11:20.395
they prevent you
from spreading it to others.

00:11:20.419 --> 00:11:21.815
Get immunized.

00:11:21.839 --> 00:11:25.283
Scientific progress is fragile
and can be lost.

00:11:25.307 --> 00:11:29.089
We must foster accurate
and respectful public dialogue.

00:11:29.427 --> 00:11:31.688
And finally, we're on the verge
of great things,

00:11:31.712 --> 00:11:33.841
a new era of vaccination.

00:11:33.865 --> 00:11:36.825
We've just scratched the surface
of what can be accomplished.

00:11:36.849 --> 00:11:38.834
Please advocate for this research.

00:11:38.858 --> 00:11:40.039
Thank you.

00:11:40.063 --> 00:11:42.951
(Applause)
