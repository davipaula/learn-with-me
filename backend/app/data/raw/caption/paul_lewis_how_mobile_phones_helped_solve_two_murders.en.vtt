Reviewer: Camille MartÃ­nez

00:00:12.364 --> 00:00:17.426
I'm here to talk to you about
a new way of doing journalism.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.063
Some people call this
"citizen journalism,"

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:22.400
other people call it
"collaborative journalism."

00:00:22.424 --> 00:00:27.604
But really, it kind of means this:
for the journalists, people like me,

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:30.804
it means accepting
that you can't know everything,

00:00:30.828 --> 00:00:33.386
and allowing other people,
through technology,

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.282
to be your eyes and your ears.

00:00:36.048 --> 00:00:39.600
And for people like you,
for other members of the public,

00:00:39.624 --> 00:00:42.949
it can mean not just being
the passive consumers of news,

00:00:42.973 --> 00:00:44.430
but also coproducing news.

00:00:45.232 --> 00:00:48.104
And I believe this can be
a really empowering process.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.923
It can enable ordinary people
to hold powerful organizations to account.

00:00:54.428 --> 00:00:57.524
So I'm going to explain this
to you today with two cases,

00:00:57.548 --> 00:00:59.412
two stories that I've investigated.

00:00:59.898 --> 00:01:02.501
And they both involve
controversial deaths.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.405
And in both cases, the authorities
put out an official version of events,

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:10.038
which was somewhat misleading.

00:01:10.598 --> 00:01:15.086
We were able to tell an alternative truth
utilizing new technology,

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.814
utilizing social media,
particularly Twitter.

00:01:18.306 --> 00:01:21.916
Essentially, what I'm talking about here
is, as I said, citizen journalism.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.354
So, to take the first case:

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:27.035
this is Ian Tomlinson,
the man in the foreground.

00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:30.127
He was a newspaper vendor from London,

00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:36.578
and on the 1st of April 2009,
he died at the G20 protests in London.

00:01:37.062 --> 00:01:39.125
Now, he had been -- he wasn't a protester,

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.357
he'd been trying to find
his way home from work

00:01:41.381 --> 00:01:42.755
through the demonstrations.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.876
But he didn't get home.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.924
He had an encounter with a man behind him,

00:01:46.948 --> 00:01:51.076
and as you can see, the man behind him
has covered his face with a balaclava.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.536
And, in fact, he wasn't showing
his badge numbers.

00:01:53.872 --> 00:01:56.766
But I can tell you now,
he was PC Simon Harwood,

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.206
a police officer with London's
Metropolitan Police Force.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.460
In fact, he belonged
to the elite territorial support group.

00:02:04.063 --> 00:02:09.396
Now, moments after this image was shot,
Harwood struck Tomlinson with a baton,

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.300
and he pushed him to ground,

00:02:11.324 --> 00:02:13.393
and Tomlinson died moments later.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.331
But that wasn't the story
the police wanted us to tell.

00:02:17.777 --> 00:02:21.026
Initially, through official statements
and off-the-record briefings,

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.230
they said that Ian Tomlinson
had died of natural causes.

00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:29.196
They said that there had been
no contact with the police,

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.562
that there were no marks on his body.

00:02:31.586 --> 00:02:34.950
In fact, they said that when police
tried to resuscitate him,

00:02:34.974 --> 00:02:38.183
the police medics
were impeded from doing so,

00:02:38.207 --> 00:02:42.703
because protesters were throwing missiles,
believed to be bottles, at police.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.348
And the result of that
were stories like this.

00:02:46.788 --> 00:02:48.635
I show you this slide,

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:51.986
because this was the newspaper
that Ian Tomlinson had been selling

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.622
for 20 years of his life.

00:02:53.646 --> 00:02:56.508
And if any news organization
had an obligation

00:02:56.532 --> 00:02:59.231
to properly forensically analyze
what had been going on,

00:02:59.255 --> 00:03:01.082
it was the Evening Standard newspaper.

00:03:01.106 --> 00:03:04.611
But they, like everyone else --
including my news organization --

00:03:04.635 --> 00:03:08.291
were misled by the official
version of events put out by police.

00:03:08.315 --> 00:03:10.056
But you can see here,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.722
the bottles that were supposedly
being thrown at police

00:03:12.746 --> 00:03:13.897
were turned into bricks

00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:16.570
by the time they reached
this edition of the newspaper.

00:03:16.594 --> 00:03:17.745
So we were suspicious,

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.218
and we wanted to see if there
was more to the story.

00:03:20.242 --> 00:03:22.890
We needed to find those protesters
you see in the image,

00:03:22.914 --> 00:03:26.293
but, of course, they had vanished
by the time we started investigating.

00:03:26.317 --> 00:03:27.930
So how do you find the witnesses?

00:03:27.954 --> 00:03:30.248
This is, for me,
where it got really interesting.

00:03:30.272 --> 00:03:31.515
We turned to the internet.

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:33.933
This is Twitter;
you've heard a lot about it today.

00:03:33.957 --> 00:03:37.067
Essentially, for me,
when I began investigating this case,

00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:40.001
I was completely new to this;
I'd signed up two days earlier.

00:03:40.025 --> 00:03:43.229
I discovered that Twitter
was a microblogging site.

00:03:43.253 --> 00:03:47.373
It enabled me to send out
short, 140-character messages.

00:03:47.397 --> 00:03:49.638
Also, an amazing search facility.

00:03:50.216 --> 00:03:54.592
But it was a social arena
in which other people were gathering

00:03:54.616 --> 00:03:56.086
with a common motive.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.386
And in this case,
independently of journalists,

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.086
people themselves were interrogating
exactly what had happened to Ian Tomlinson

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.644
in his last 30 minutes of life.

00:04:08.768 --> 00:04:10.434
Individuals like these two guys.

00:04:11.038 --> 00:04:14.422
They went to Ian Tomlinson's aid
after he collapsed.

00:04:15.411 --> 00:04:17.185
They phoned the ambulance.

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.480
They didn't see any bottles,
they didn't see any bricks.

00:04:20.971 --> 00:04:24.084
So they were concerned
that the stories weren't quite as accurate

00:04:24.108 --> 00:04:25.929
as police were claiming them to be.

00:04:25.953 --> 00:04:28.766
And again, through social media,
we started encountering

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.492
individuals with material like this:
photographs, evidence.

00:04:32.516 --> 00:04:36.190
Now, this does not show the attack
on Ian Tomlinson,

00:04:36.214 --> 00:04:38.259
but he appears to be in some distress.

00:04:38.746 --> 00:04:40.586
Was he drunk? Did he fall over?

00:04:41.024 --> 00:04:44.193
Did this have anything to do
with the police officers next to him?

00:04:44.217 --> 00:04:46.040
Here he appears to be talking to them.

00:04:46.064 --> 00:04:50.585
For us, this was enough
to investigate further, to dig deeper.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.566
The result was putting out
stories ourselves.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.241
One of the most amazing things
about the internet is:

00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:02.443
the information that people put out
is freely available to anyone,

00:05:02.467 --> 00:05:03.618
as we all know.

00:05:03.642 --> 00:05:05.786
That doesn't just go
for citizen journalists,

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.955
or for people putting out messages
on Facebook or Twitter.

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:10.775
That goes for journalists themselves,

00:05:10.799 --> 00:05:11.952
people like me.

00:05:11.976 --> 00:05:16.215
As long as your news is the right side
of a paywall, i.e, it's free,

00:05:16.239 --> 00:05:17.860
anybody can access it.

00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:19.055
And stories like these,

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:21.638
which were questioning
the official version of events,

00:05:21.662 --> 00:05:23.216
which were skeptical in tone,

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.996
allowed people to realize
that we had questions ourselves.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.478
They were online magnets.

00:05:28.838 --> 00:05:32.410
Individuals with material that could
help us were drawn toward us

00:05:32.434 --> 00:05:34.473
by some kind of gravitational force.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.297
And after six days, we had managed
to track down around 20 witnesses.

00:05:41.463 --> 00:05:43.173
We've plotted them here on the map.

00:05:43.197 --> 00:05:45.256
This is the scene
of Ian Tomlinson's death,

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.985
the Bank of England in London.

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:49.627
And each of these witnesses
that we plotted on the map,

00:05:49.651 --> 00:05:52.316
you could click on these
small bullet points,

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.618
and you could hear what they had to say,

00:05:54.642 --> 00:05:56.438
see their photographic image

00:05:56.462 --> 00:05:59.181
and at times,
see their videographic images as well.

00:05:59.716 --> 00:06:01.805
But still, at this stage,

00:06:01.829 --> 00:06:05.735
with witnesses telling us that they'd seen
police attack Ian Tomlinson

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:06.910
before his death,

00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:09.793
still, police refused to accept that.

00:06:10.452 --> 00:06:12.970
There was no official
investigation into his death.

00:06:14.025 --> 00:06:15.656
And then something changed.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.587
I got an email from an investment fund
manager in New York.

00:06:20.183 --> 00:06:23.788
On the day of Ian Tomlinson's death,
he'd been in London on business,

00:06:23.812 --> 00:06:26.350
and he'd taken out his digital camera,

00:06:27.112 --> 00:06:28.939
and he'd recorded this.

00:06:34.471 --> 00:06:36.862
(Video) Narrator:
This is the crowd at G20 protest

00:06:36.886 --> 00:06:39.173
on April the 1st, around 7:20pm.

00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:42.186
They were on Cornhill,
near the Bank of England.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.016
This footage will form the basis
of a police investigation

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.700
into the death of this man.

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:49.378
Ian Tomlinson was walking
through this area,

00:06:49.402 --> 00:06:51.092
attempting to get home from work.

00:06:51.583 --> 00:06:53.913
(People yelling)

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.966
We've slowed down the footage
to show how it poses serious questions

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.567
about police conduct.

00:07:11.591 --> 00:07:14.876
Ian Tomlinson had his back
to riot officers and dog handlers

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.619
and was walking away from them.

00:07:16.643 --> 00:07:18.592
He had his hands in his pockets.

00:07:18.616 --> 00:07:22.395
Here the riot officer appears to strike
Tomlinson's leg area with a baton.

00:07:22.927 --> 00:07:25.258
He then lunges at Tomlinson from behind.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.702
Tomlinson is propelled forward
and hits the floor.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.492
(People yelling)

00:07:44.818 --> 00:07:46.496
Paul Lewis: OK. So, shocking stuff.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.237
That video wasn't playing too well,

00:07:48.261 --> 00:07:51.007
but I remember when I first watched
the video for myself,

00:07:51.031 --> 00:07:54.206
I'd been in touch with
this investment fund manager in New York,

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.426
and I had become obsessed with this story.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:00.323
I had spoken to so many people
who said they had seen this happen,

00:08:00.347 --> 00:08:02.894
and the guy on the other end
of the phone was saying,

00:08:02.918 --> 00:08:04.283
"Look, the video shows it."

00:08:04.307 --> 00:08:06.927
I didn't want to believe him
until I saw it for myself.

00:08:06.951 --> 00:08:10.006
It was two o'clock in the morning,
I was there with an IT guy --

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:11.256
the video wasn't coming.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.222
Finally, it landed, and I clicked on it.

00:08:13.246 --> 00:08:16.133
And I realized: this is really
something quite significant.

00:08:16.157 --> 00:08:18.727
Within 15 hours, we put it on our website.

00:08:18.751 --> 00:08:21.456
The first thing police did
was they came to our office --

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.269
senior officers came to our office --

00:08:23.293 --> 00:08:25.026
and asked us to take the video down.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:26.209
We said no.

00:08:26.233 --> 00:08:27.983
It would have been too late, anyway,

00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:29.993
because it had traveled around the world.

00:08:30.017 --> 00:08:32.536
And the officer in that film,
in two days' time,

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.846
will appear before
an inquest jury in London,

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.788
and they have the power to decide
that Ian Tomlinson was unlawfully killed.

00:08:38.812 --> 00:08:41.326
So that's the first case;
I said two cases today.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:42.896
The second case is this man.

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:47.084
Now, like Ian Tomlinson,
he was a father, he lived in London.

00:08:47.108 --> 00:08:50.615
But he was a political
refugee from Angola.

00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:53.104
And six months ago,
the British government decided

00:08:53.128 --> 00:08:55.545
they wanted to return him to Angola;

00:08:55.569 --> 00:08:57.446
he was a failed asylum seeker.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:01.496
So they booked him a seat on an airline,
a flight from Heathrow.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.746
Now, the official version of events,
the official explanation,

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.336
of Jimmy Mubenga's death

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.486
was simply that he'd taken ill.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:12.749
He'd become unwell on the flight,
the plane had returned to Heathrow,

00:09:12.773 --> 00:09:15.686
and then he was transferred to hospital
and pronounced dead.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.166
Now, what actually happened
to Jimmy Mubenga,

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:21.370
the story we were able to tell,
my colleague Mathew Taylor and I,

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:24.737
was that, actually, three security guards
began trying to restrain him

00:09:24.761 --> 00:09:25.912
in his seat;

00:09:25.936 --> 00:09:29.452
when was resisting his deportation,
they were restraining him in his seat.

00:09:29.476 --> 00:09:31.899
They placed him in a dangerous hold.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.356
It keeps detainees quiet,
and he was making a lot of noise.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.626
But it can also lead
to positional asphyxia,

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:39.882
a form of suffocation.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:43.374
So you have to imagine:
there were other passengers on the plane,

00:09:43.398 --> 00:09:44.903
and they could hear him saying,

00:09:44.927 --> 00:09:47.514
"I can't breathe! I can't breathe!
They're killing me!"

00:09:47.538 --> 00:09:49.045
And then he stopped breathing.

00:09:49.069 --> 00:09:50.832
So how did we find these passengers?

00:09:50.856 --> 00:09:53.956
In the case of Ian Tomlinson,
the witnesses were still in London.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.772
But these passengers,
many of them, had returned to Angola.

00:09:56.796 --> 00:09:58.316
How were we going to find them?

00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.939
Again, we turned to the internet.

00:09:59.963 --> 00:10:03.278
We wrote, as I said before,
stories -- they're online magnets.

00:10:03.302 --> 00:10:06.780
The tone of some these stories,
journalism professors might frown upon

00:10:06.804 --> 00:10:08.232
because they were skeptical;

00:10:08.256 --> 00:10:10.596
they were asking questions,
perhaps speculative,

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.984
maybe the kind of things
journalists shouldn't do.

00:10:13.008 --> 00:10:15.996
But we needed to do it,
and we needed to use Twitter also.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.281
Here I'm saying an Angolan man
dies on a flight.

00:10:18.305 --> 00:10:20.656
This story could be big;
a level of speculation.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.176
This next tweet says, "Please RT."

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.558
That means "please retweet,"
please pass down the chain.

00:10:27.375 --> 00:10:30.227
And one of the fascinating
things about Twitter

00:10:30.251 --> 00:10:32.410
is that the pattern of flow of information

00:10:32.434 --> 00:10:34.766
is unlike anything we've ever seen before.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.256
We don't really understand it,

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.502
but once you let go
of a piece of information,

00:10:38.526 --> 00:10:39.890
it travels like wind.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.345
You can't determine where it ends up.

00:10:42.889 --> 00:10:44.571
But strangely,

00:10:44.595 --> 00:10:48.422
tweets have an uncanny ability
to reach their intended destination.

00:10:48.446 --> 00:10:50.697
And in this case, it was this man.

00:10:51.591 --> 00:10:55.606
He says, "I was also there on the BA77" --
that's the flight number --

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.566
"And the man was begging for help,

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.120
and I now feel so guilty
that I did nothing."

00:11:00.144 --> 00:11:01.748
This was Michael.

00:11:01.772 --> 00:11:06.181
He was on an Angolan oil field
when he sent me this tweet.

00:11:06.205 --> 00:11:07.691
I was in my office in London.

00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:10.896
He had concerns about
what happened on the flight.

00:11:11.526 --> 00:11:14.472
He'd gone onto his laptop,
he typed in the flight number.

00:11:14.496 --> 00:11:17.866
He had encountered that tweet,
he had encountered our stories.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:23.162
He realized we had an intention
to tell a different version of events;

00:11:23.186 --> 00:11:24.377
we were skeptical.

00:11:24.787 --> 00:11:26.082
And he contacted me.

00:11:26.905 --> 00:11:28.727
And this is what Michael said.

00:11:28.751 --> 00:11:32.466
(Audio) Michael: I'm pretty sure
it'll turn out to be asphyxiation.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:36.314
The last thing we heard the man saying
was he couldn't breathe.

00:11:36.338 --> 00:11:40.455
And you've got three security guards,

00:11:40.479 --> 00:11:44.452
each one of them looked
like 100-kilo plus,

00:11:44.476 --> 00:11:47.635
bearing down on him, holding him
down -- from what I could see,

00:11:47.659 --> 00:11:48.936
below the seats.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:54.118
What I saw was the three men trying
to pull him down below the seats.

00:11:54.142 --> 00:11:57.166
And all I could see was his head
sticking up above the seats,

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:00.998
and he was hollering out,
you know, "Help me!"

00:12:01.022 --> 00:12:04.043
He just kept saying, "Help me! Help me!"

00:12:04.067 --> 00:12:07.741
And then he disappeared below the seats.

00:12:07.765 --> 00:12:12.297
And you could see the three security
guards sitting on top of him from there.

00:12:13.391 --> 00:12:15.227
For the rest of my life,

00:12:15.251 --> 00:12:18.616
I'm always going to have that
in the back of my mind.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.315
Could I have done something?

00:12:20.339 --> 00:12:23.949
That's going to bother me
every time I lay down to go to sleep now.

00:12:23.973 --> 00:12:25.723
Wow; I didn't get involved

00:12:25.747 --> 00:12:30.050
because I was scared I might get
kicked off the flight and lose my job.

00:12:30.074 --> 00:12:33.716
If it takes three men to hold a man down,

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.434
to put him on a flight,

00:12:36.458 --> 00:12:38.914
one the public is on,

00:12:38.938 --> 00:12:40.478
that's excessive.

00:12:40.502 --> 00:12:42.062
OK?

00:12:42.086 --> 00:12:45.326
If the man died,

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:47.945
that right there is excessive.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:53.117
PL: So that was his interpretation
of what had happened on the flight.

00:12:53.141 --> 00:12:55.606
And Michael was actually
one of five witnesses

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:59.367
that we eventually managed to track down,
most of them, as I said,

00:12:59.391 --> 00:13:02.815
through the internet,
through social media.

00:13:02.839 --> 00:13:04.898
We could actually place them on the plane,

00:13:04.922 --> 00:13:07.201
so you could see
exactly where they were sat.

00:13:07.225 --> 00:13:08.684
And I should say at this stage

00:13:08.708 --> 00:13:11.102
that one really important
dimension to all of this

00:13:11.126 --> 00:13:13.526
for journalists who utilize social media

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.579
and who utilize citizen journalism

00:13:15.603 --> 00:13:17.996
is making sure we get our facts correct.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.623
Verification is absolutely essential.

00:13:20.647 --> 00:13:23.462
So in the case
of the Ian Tomlinson witnesses,

00:13:23.486 --> 00:13:25.936
I got them to return
to the scene of the death

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.112
and physically walk me through

00:13:28.136 --> 00:13:30.158
and tell me exactly what they had seen.

00:13:30.819 --> 00:13:32.509
That was absolutely essential.

00:13:32.533 --> 00:13:34.600
In the case of Mubenga,
we couldn't do that,

00:13:34.624 --> 00:13:36.740
but they could send us
their boarding passes.

00:13:36.764 --> 00:13:38.980
And we could interrogate
what they were saying

00:13:39.004 --> 00:13:42.474
and ensure it was consistent with what
other passengers were saying, too.

00:13:42.498 --> 00:13:45.692
The danger in all of this
for journalists -- for all of us --

00:13:45.716 --> 00:13:47.881
is that we're victims of hoaxes,

00:13:47.905 --> 00:13:52.413
or that there's deliberate misinformation
fed into the public domain.

00:13:52.437 --> 00:13:54.196
So we have to be careful.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.915
But nobody can deny
the power of citizen journalism.

00:13:57.939 --> 00:14:01.207
When a plane crashes
into the Hudson two years ago,

00:14:01.231 --> 00:14:05.014
and the world finds out about this
because a man is on a nearby ferry,

00:14:05.038 --> 00:14:08.476
and he takes out his iPhone
and photographs the image of the plane

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.036
and sends it around the world --

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.233
that's how most people
found out initially,

00:14:12.257 --> 00:14:15.916
in the early minutes and hours,
about the plane in the Hudson River.

00:14:16.724 --> 00:14:19.893
Now, think of the two biggest
news stories of the year.

00:14:19.917 --> 00:14:22.689
We had the Japanese earthquake
and the tsunami.

00:14:23.534 --> 00:14:26.856
Cast your mind's eye
back to the images that you saw

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.727
on your television screens.

00:14:28.751 --> 00:14:32.426
They were boats left five miles inland.

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:34.531
They were houses being moved along,

00:14:35.239 --> 00:14:36.577
as if in the sea.

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:41.854
Water lifting up inside people's
living rooms, supermarkets shaking --

00:14:41.878 --> 00:14:44.226
these were images
shot by citizen journalists

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.106
and instantly shared on the internet.

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:50.573
And the other big story of the year:
the political crisis,

00:14:50.597 --> 00:14:53.146
the political earthquake
in the Middle East.

00:14:53.684 --> 00:14:58.086
And it doesn't matter if it was
Egypt or Libya or Syria or Yemen.

00:14:58.642 --> 00:15:03.458
Individuals have managed to overcome
the repressive restrictions

00:15:03.482 --> 00:15:04.633
in those regimes

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.416
by recording their environment

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.666
and telling their own stories
on the internet.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.734
Again, always very difficult to verify,

00:15:11.758 --> 00:15:15.340
but potentially,
a huge layer of accountability.

00:15:15.823 --> 00:15:18.426
This image -- and I could have
shown you any, actually;

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:19.716
YouTube is full of them --

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.763
This image is of an apparently
unarmed protester in Bahrain.

00:15:24.347 --> 00:15:26.532
And he's being shot by security forces.

00:15:27.285 --> 00:15:31.666
It doesn't matter
if the individual being mistreated,

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:33.099
possibly even killed,

00:15:33.837 --> 00:15:35.363
is in Bahrain or in London.

00:15:35.803 --> 00:15:39.227
But citizen journalism and this
technology has inserted

00:15:39.251 --> 00:15:42.536
a new layer of accountability
into our world,

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.321
and I think that's a good thing.

00:15:44.345 --> 00:15:47.734
So to conclude: the theme
of the conference, "Why not?" --

00:15:48.663 --> 00:15:51.067
I think for journalists,
it's quite simple, really.

00:15:51.091 --> 00:15:53.411
I mean, why not utilize this technology,

00:15:53.435 --> 00:15:57.120
which massively broadens
the boundaries of what's possible,

00:15:57.144 --> 00:16:00.736
accept that many of the things
that happen in our world now go recorded,

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.082
and we can obtain that information

00:16:03.106 --> 00:16:04.377
through social media?

00:16:04.834 --> 00:16:06.208
That's new for journalists.

00:16:06.232 --> 00:16:10.006
The stories I showed you, I don't think
we would have been able to investigate

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:13.006
10 years ago, possibly even
five years ago.

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:16.086
I think there's a very good argument
to say that the two deaths,

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.946
the death of Ian Tomlinson
and the death of Jimmy Mubenga,

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:22.506
we still today wouldn't know
exactly what had happened in those cases.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.916
And "Why not?" for people like yourselves?

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.535
Well, I think that's very simple, too.

00:16:27.559 --> 00:16:31.196
If you encounter something
that you believe is problematic,

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:35.281
that disturbs you, that concerns you,
an injustice of some kind,

00:16:35.305 --> 00:16:38.326
something that just
doesn't feel quite right,

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:43.022
then why not witness it,
record it and share it?

00:16:43.993 --> 00:16:49.317
That process of witnessing,
recording and sharing is journalism.

00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:52.106
And we can all do it. Thank you.
