00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.208
David Biello: So Victor,
what have you been up to?

00:00:17.042 --> 00:00:19.684
Victor Vescovo: That's the bottom
of the Atlantic Ocean,

00:00:19.708 --> 00:00:22.684
and I guess I read too much
Jules Verne as a young boy,

00:00:22.708 --> 00:00:26.559
and so for the last four years
I've led a team to design and build

00:00:26.583 --> 00:00:30.143
what is now the most advanced and deepest
diving submersible on the planet,

00:00:30.167 --> 00:00:32.809
and I have the ability
to personally pilot it too.

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:35.101
So this was us in December of last year,

00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:37.768
for the first time --
the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.

00:00:37.792 --> 00:00:39.726
DB: And nobody's seen that before right?

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.476
That's just you.
VV: No.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.893
Well, now everybody else.

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:45.434
DB: Who does that?

00:00:45.458 --> 00:00:46.726
Like --

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.476
VV: Well, I think everyone has seen
the developments in the last 10, 15 years.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.893
You have a bunch of people that have
the means to explore outer space,

00:00:53.917 --> 00:00:56.268
like SpaceX or Blue Origin --

00:00:56.292 --> 00:00:57.559
those guys --

00:00:57.583 --> 00:00:59.351
and we're going the other direction.

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:00.643
So it's a wonderful era

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:02.893
of private individuals
spending their resources

00:01:02.917 --> 00:01:05.268
to develop technologies
that can take us to places

00:01:05.292 --> 00:01:07.101
that have never been explored before,

00:01:07.125 --> 00:01:08.976
and the oceans of the world is --

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.684
it's almost a clichÃ© to say
it's 70 percent of our entire planet,

00:01:12.708 --> 00:01:15.143
and of that, 95 percent is unexplored.

00:01:15.167 --> 00:01:17.476
So what we're trying to do
with our expedition

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.393
is to build and prove out a submersible

00:01:19.417 --> 00:01:22.101
that can go to any point
on the bottom of the planet

00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:26.708
to explore the 60 percent of this planet
that is still unexplored.

00:01:27.208 --> 00:01:29.559
DB: You need a pretty cool tool
to do that, right?

00:01:29.583 --> 00:01:30.851
VV: Right.

00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:33.476
Now the tool is the submarine,
the Limiting Factor.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.976
It's a state-of-the-art vessel

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.454
supported by the support ship,
the Pressure Drop.

00:01:37.478 --> 00:01:40.268
It has a two-person titanium sphere,
90 millimeters-thick,

00:01:40.292 --> 00:01:41.893
that keeps it at one atmosphere,

00:01:41.917 --> 00:01:44.601
and it has the ability to dive repeatedly

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:47.143
down to the very deepest
point of the ocean.

00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:51.351
DB: So like the SpaceX
of ocean exploration?

00:01:51.375 --> 00:01:53.976
VV: Yeah, it's kind of the SpaceX
of ocean exploration,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.684
but I pilot my own vehicles.

00:01:55.708 --> 00:01:57.559
(Laughter)

00:01:57.583 --> 00:02:00.726
DB: Are you going to take Elon or...?

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.809
VV: Yeah, I could take someone down there.

00:02:02.833 --> 00:02:04.309
So, Elon, if you're listening,

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:07.184
I'll give you a ride in mine
if you give me a ride in yours.

00:02:07.208 --> 00:02:09.000
(Laughter)

00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:12.851
DB: So tell us what it's like down there.

00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:16.268
I mean, we're talking about a place
where the pressure is so intense

00:02:16.292 --> 00:02:18.726
that it's like putting
an Eiffel Tower on your toe.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.059
VV: It's more than that.

00:02:20.083 --> 00:02:21.518
It's about 16,000 psi.

00:02:21.542 --> 00:02:23.934
So the issue is that we have
this titanium sphere

00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.393
that allows us to go down
to these extreme depths

00:02:26.417 --> 00:02:28.059
and come up repeatedly.

00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:29.559
That's never been done before.

00:02:29.583 --> 00:02:31.643
The Challenger Deep has been dived twice,

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:34.934
once in 1960 and once in 2012
by James Cameron,

00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:38.268
and they went down and came back up
and those were experimental craft.

00:02:38.292 --> 00:02:40.768
This is the first commercially
certified submersible

00:02:40.792 --> 00:02:44.018
that can go up and down
thousands of times with two people,

00:02:44.042 --> 00:02:45.309
including a scientist.

00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:47.184
We're very proud that we took down

00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:49.393
the deepest-diving
British citizen in history

00:02:49.417 --> 00:02:52.393
just three weeks ago,
Dr. Alan Jamieson of Newcastle University

00:02:52.417 --> 00:02:55.018
who was down with us on the Java Trench.

00:02:55.042 --> 00:02:59.934
DB: So, not too much freaks you out,
is what I'm guessing.

00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.059
VV: Well, it's a lot
different to go diving.

00:03:02.083 --> 00:03:05.184
If you're claustrophobic,
you do not want to be in the submarine.

00:03:05.208 --> 00:03:06.559
We go down quite a distance

00:03:06.583 --> 00:03:10.018
and the missions typically last
eight to nine hours in a confined space.

00:03:10.042 --> 00:03:12.518
It's very different
from the career I had previously

00:03:12.542 --> 00:03:15.184
which was mountain climbing
where you're in open spaces,

00:03:15.208 --> 00:03:17.018
the wind is whipping, it's very cold.

00:03:17.042 --> 00:03:19.268
This is the opposite.
It's much more technical.

00:03:19.292 --> 00:03:21.893
It's much more about precision
in using the instruments

00:03:21.917 --> 00:03:24.143
and troubleshooting
anything that can go wrong.

00:03:24.167 --> 00:03:26.726
But if something really
goes wrong in the submersible,

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.143
you're not going to know it.

00:03:28.167 --> 00:03:29.476
(Laughter)

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.976
DB: So you're afraid of leaks
is what you're saying.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.851
VV: Leaks are not good,
but if it's a leak that's happening,

00:03:34.875 --> 00:03:37.059
it's not that bad
because if it was really bad

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:38.809
you wouldn't know it, again, but --

00:03:38.833 --> 00:03:41.684
you know, fire in the capsule,
that wouldn't be good either,

00:03:41.708 --> 00:03:43.768
but it's actually a very safe submersible.

00:03:43.792 --> 00:03:46.268
I like to say I don't trust
a lot of things in life,

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:48.101
but I do trust titanium, I trust math

00:03:48.125 --> 00:03:50.184
and I trust finite element analysis,

00:03:50.208 --> 00:03:51.518
which is how you figure out

00:03:51.542 --> 00:03:53.601
whether or not
things like this can survive

00:03:53.625 --> 00:03:55.768
these extraordinary
pressures and conditions.

00:03:55.792 --> 00:03:58.934
DB: And that sphere
is so perfectly machined, right?

00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.934
This is a truly unique craft.

00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.434
VV: That was the real trick --

00:04:02.458 --> 00:04:04.309
is actually building a titanium sphere

00:04:04.333 --> 00:04:07.476
that was accurate
to within .1 percent of machine.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.059
Titanium is a hard metal to work

00:04:09.083 --> 00:04:11.143
and a lot of people
haven't figured it out,

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:12.518
but we were very fortunate.

00:04:12.542 --> 00:04:15.643
Our extraordinary team was able
to make an almost perfect sphere,

00:04:15.667 --> 00:04:18.101
which when you're subjecting
something to pressure,

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:20.184
that's the strongest
geometry you can have.

00:04:20.208 --> 00:04:22.601
When I'm in the submersible
and that hatch closes,

00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:25.351
I'm confident that I'm going
to go down and come back up.

00:04:25.375 --> 00:04:27.476
DB: And that's the thing
you double-check --

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.809
that the hatch is closed?

00:04:28.833 --> 00:04:31.267
VV: There are only two rules
in diving a submarine.

00:04:31.291 --> 00:04:33.184
Number one is close the hatch securely.

00:04:33.208 --> 00:04:35.184
Number two is go back to rule number one.

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:38.601
DB: Alright so, Atlantic Ocean: check.

00:04:38.625 --> 00:04:40.393
Southern Ocean: check.

00:04:40.417 --> 00:04:42.893
VV: No one has ever dived
the Southern Ocean before.

00:04:42.917 --> 00:04:44.226
I know why.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.643
It's really, really hostile.

00:04:45.667 --> 00:04:46.976
The weather is awful.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.226
The word collision comes to mind.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.101
But we did that one, yes.

00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:52.643
Glad that's over --
DB: Yeah --

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:54.018
VV: Thank you.

00:04:54.042 --> 00:04:55.184
(Applause)

00:04:55.208 --> 00:04:57.101
DB: It's like you're racing through it.

00:04:57.125 --> 00:04:59.559
And now the Indian Ocean,
as Kelly mentioned.

00:04:59.583 --> 00:05:01.309
VV: Yeah, that was three weeks ago.

00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:03.934
We were fortunate enough
to actually solve the mystery.

00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.893
If someone had asked me three weeks ago,

00:05:05.917 --> 00:05:08.351
"What is the deepest point
in the Indian Ocean?" --

00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:09.643
no one really knew.

00:05:09.667 --> 00:05:10.976
There were two candidates,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.643
one off of Western Australia
and one in the Java Trench.

00:05:13.667 --> 00:05:16.101
We have this wonderful ship
with a brilliant sonar.

00:05:16.125 --> 00:05:17.393
We mapped both of them.

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:19.684
We sent landers down
to the bottom and verified.

00:05:19.708 --> 00:05:22.309
It's actually in the center portion
of the Java Trench,

00:05:22.333 --> 00:05:24.143
which is where no one thought it was.

00:05:24.167 --> 00:05:26.976
In fact, every time we've completed
one of our major dives,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.143
we have to run off
to Wikipedia and change it

00:05:29.167 --> 00:05:30.643
because it's completely wrong.

00:05:30.667 --> 00:05:32.309
(Laughter)

00:05:32.333 --> 00:05:35.393
DB: So it probably takes longer
to get down there

00:05:35.417 --> 00:05:37.684
than the time you're able
to spend down there?

00:05:37.708 --> 00:05:40.601
VV: No, we actually spend
quite a bit of time.

00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:43.476
I have four days
of oxygen supply in the vessel.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.059
If I'm down there for four days,

00:05:45.083 --> 00:05:47.893
something's gone so wrong
I'm probably not going to use it,

00:05:47.917 --> 00:05:50.976
but it's about three hours down
to the deepest part of the ocean

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.309
and then we can spend
usually three or four hours

00:05:53.333 --> 00:05:54.893
and then another three hours up.

00:05:54.917 --> 00:05:57.976
So you don't want to stay in there
for more than 10 or 11 hours.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.309
It can get a little tight.

00:05:59.333 --> 00:06:01.559
DB: Alright, so the bottom
of the Indian Ocean.

00:06:01.583 --> 00:06:05.851
And this is something that no one
besides you has ever seen before --

00:06:05.875 --> 00:06:09.893
VV: This is actually imagery
from one of our robotic landers.

00:06:09.917 --> 00:06:12.851
On the bottom right you can
actually see a robust assfish --

00:06:12.875 --> 00:06:14.476
that's what it's actually called.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.518
(Laughter)

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:18.934
But you can see from the left
a creature that's never been seen before.

00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:22.184
It's actually a bottom-dwelling jellyfish
called a stalked ascidian,

00:06:22.208 --> 00:06:24.643
and none of them
have ever looked like this before.

00:06:24.667 --> 00:06:27.393
It actually has a small child
at the bottom of its stalk,

00:06:27.417 --> 00:06:29.559
and it just drifted across beautifully.

00:06:29.583 --> 00:06:32.059
So every single dive we have gone on,

00:06:32.083 --> 00:06:34.726
even though we're only down there
for a couple of hours,

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.643
we have found three or four new species

00:06:36.667 --> 00:06:39.976
because these are places that have
been isolated for billions of years

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.351
and no human being has ever
been down there to film them

00:06:43.375 --> 00:06:44.643
or take samples.

00:06:44.667 --> 00:06:46.518
And so this is extraordinary for us --

00:06:46.542 --> 00:06:48.893
(Applause)

00:06:48.917 --> 00:06:50.226
So what we are hoping --

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.601
the main objective of our mission
is to build this tool.

00:06:53.625 --> 00:06:55.268
This tool is a door,

00:06:55.292 --> 00:06:56.601
because with this tool,

00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:58.809
we'll be able to make
more of them potentially

00:06:58.833 --> 00:07:01.184
and take scientists down
to do thousands of dives,

00:07:01.208 --> 00:07:03.434
to open that door to exploration

00:07:03.458 --> 00:07:06.518
and find things that we
had no idea even existed.

00:07:06.542 --> 00:07:11.434
DB: And so more people have been
to space than the bottom of the ocean.

00:07:11.458 --> 00:07:13.101
You're one of three.

00:07:13.125 --> 00:07:16.018
You're going to up that number,
you're going to give it away.

00:07:16.042 --> 00:07:19.309
VV: Yeah, three people have dived
to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.

00:07:19.333 --> 00:07:21.476
The USS Trieste in 1960
with two individuals.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.018
James Cameron in 2012
with his Deep Sea Challenger --

00:07:24.042 --> 00:07:25.601
thank you, Jim, great sub.

00:07:25.625 --> 00:07:27.476
This is a third-generation technology.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.476
We're not only going to try and go down,
actually in two weeks,

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.768
but we're going to try
and do it multiple times,

00:07:32.792 --> 00:07:34.393
which has never been done before.

00:07:34.417 --> 00:07:36.851
If we can do that,
we'll have proven the technology

00:07:36.875 --> 00:07:39.476
and that door will not just go open,
it will stay open.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.768
(Applause)
