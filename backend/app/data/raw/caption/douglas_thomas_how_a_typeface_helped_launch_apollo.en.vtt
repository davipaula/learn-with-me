00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:15.351
In 1969 in July,

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:18.309
three Americans launched into space.

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.726
Now, they went to the surface of the moon,

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.226
they famously made
the great leap for mankind.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.351
Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong,
they walked on the surface,

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:28.643
they planted this flag.

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:34.101
It's rightly celebrated as a moment
that in America we say is a triumph.

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:37.101
We think it was this
amazing accomplishment.

00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:39.393
They didn't just leave behind
this flag, though.

00:00:39.417 --> 00:00:40.894
They also left behind a plaque.

00:00:40.918 --> 00:00:42.559
This plaque is a beautiful object,

00:00:42.583 --> 00:00:45.143
and one that I want to talk to you
a little bit about.

00:00:45.167 --> 00:00:47.406
First, you might notice
that there's two globes,

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.684
representing all of earth.

00:00:48.708 --> 00:00:50.726
And then there's this beautiful statement:

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.434
"We came in peace for all mankind."

00:00:52.458 --> 00:00:55.559
Now, at first, this is just
nice poetic language,

00:00:55.583 --> 00:00:59.434
but it's also set in a typeface
that's perfect for this moment.

00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:02.643
It seems industrial, it seems engineered.

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:04.239
It also is the best possible name

00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:08.059
you could come up with
for something on the moon: Futura.

00:01:08.083 --> 00:01:09.941
Now, I want to talk to you about fonts,

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:12.309
and why this typeface is perfect
for this moment.

00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:14.417
But it's actually more
than just ceremonial.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.018
Now, when all of you arrived here today,

00:01:18.042 --> 00:01:20.643
you actually had to think about fonts.

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:21.934
You might not realize it,

00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.934
but you're all unconscious
experts on typography.

00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:29.309
Typography is the study
of how fonts inhabit our world,

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:33.250
they're the visual language
of the words we use.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.309
Here's the thing
that's funny about this, though.

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:39.101
I know you're probably not like me,
you're not a font nerd,

00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:41.851
maybe some of you are,
but if you're not, that's alright,

00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:43.851
because I might spend hours every day

00:01:43.875 --> 00:01:46.685
trying to pick the perfect typeface
for the perfect project,

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:49.018
or I might spend thousands
of dollars every year,

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:51.101
trying to get ones
with the right features.

00:01:51.125 --> 00:01:54.268
But all of you actually spend hours
every day, evaluating fonts.

00:01:54.292 --> 00:01:56.851
If you don't believe me,
think about how you got here.

00:01:56.875 --> 00:01:58.643
Each of you had to judge by the signs

00:01:58.667 --> 00:02:00.101
and maybe even on your phone,

00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:03.601
which signals to trust
and which to ignore.

00:02:03.625 --> 00:02:04.893
You were evaluating fonts.

00:02:04.917 --> 00:02:07.143
Or maybe when you're just
buying a new product,

00:02:07.167 --> 00:02:09.691
you have to think about
whether something is expensive

00:02:09.715 --> 00:02:13.434
or cheap or hard to get or easy to find.

00:02:13.458 --> 00:02:15.059
And the funny thing about it is,

00:02:15.083 --> 00:02:16.941
this may not seem extraordinary to you,

00:02:16.965 --> 00:02:19.268
but the moment you see
something out of place,

00:02:19.292 --> 00:02:20.643
you recognize it right away.

00:02:20.667 --> 00:02:23.059
(Laughter)

00:02:23.083 --> 00:02:24.768
The thing I love about typography,

00:02:24.792 --> 00:02:27.059
and why I love fonts
and why I love Futura,

00:02:27.083 --> 00:02:30.934
is that, for me,
what I study is everywhere.

00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.643
Every street that I walk down,
every book that I pick up,

00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:38.809
every thing that I read
is filled with the thing I love.

00:02:38.833 --> 00:02:43.143
Now, once you understand the history
and what happens with typography,

00:02:43.167 --> 00:02:46.559
you actually have a history
of everything before you.

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:48.809
And this is the typeface Futura.

00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:52.226
As previously we've discussed,
this is modernism in miniature.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.018
This is a way in which modernism
infiltrated this country

00:02:55.042 --> 00:02:58.268
and became perhaps the most popular,
or promiscuous typeface,

00:02:58.292 --> 00:03:00.268
of the twentieth century.

00:03:00.292 --> 00:03:03.601
"Less is more," right, these are
the aphorisms of modernism.

00:03:03.625 --> 00:03:05.893
And in the visual arts,
the same thing happened.

00:03:05.917 --> 00:03:08.601
Let's focus on the essentials,
focus on the basic shapes,

00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:09.893
focus on geometry.

00:03:09.917 --> 00:03:12.643
So Futura actually holds this to its core.

00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:15.101
You might notice that the shapes
inherent in Futura

00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:16.851
have circles, squares, triangles.

00:03:16.875 --> 00:03:18.976
Some of the shapes
are all based on circles,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.268
like the O, D and C,

00:03:20.292 --> 00:03:23.768
or others have this pointed
apex of the triangle.

00:03:23.792 --> 00:03:26.018
Others just look like
they might have been made

00:03:26.042 --> 00:03:27.351
with a ruler or a compass.

00:03:27.375 --> 00:03:30.059
They feel geometric,
they feel mathematic, precise.

00:03:30.083 --> 00:03:32.684
In fact, this whole system
carries through with the way

00:03:32.708 --> 00:03:34.226
that the typeface was designed.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.601
To not look like it was made
like other typefaces, to be something new.

00:03:37.625 --> 00:03:41.851
Here it is in the lightweight,
the medium weight and the bold weight.

00:03:41.875 --> 00:03:44.851
The whole family has
different things to commend to it.

00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:46.851
This was a conscious break from the past,

00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:50.143
something that looked like it was made
by a machine, and not by hand.

00:03:50.167 --> 00:03:52.476
When I say not made by hand,
this is what I mean.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.143
This is what we think about maybe,

00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:57.768
when you might create something
with a calligraphic brush or a pen.

00:03:57.792 --> 00:03:59.226
That there's thicks and thins.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.643
And even more traditional typefaces,
say like a Garamond,

00:04:02.667 --> 00:04:04.434
holds vestiges of this old system

00:04:04.458 --> 00:04:07.726
in which you can see the A
where it get little bit thinner at the top

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.018
and thicker down below,

00:04:09.042 --> 00:04:11.934
because it's trying to look like
someone had made it by hand.

00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.268
But Futura, in contrast,

00:04:13.292 --> 00:04:15.851
is designed to look like
no one had touched it at all,

00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:17.434
that this was made by a machine,

00:04:17.458 --> 00:04:19.434
for a machine age, for an industrial age.

00:04:19.458 --> 00:04:21.518
There's actually a sleight of hand here

00:04:21.542 --> 00:04:25.268
that Paul Renner, the designer
who made this in 1927, employed.

00:04:25.292 --> 00:04:26.809
If you look at the way in which

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:29.767
the circular shape
joins with the vertical shaft,

00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:33.017
you'll notice that it tapers
just every so slightly.

00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:34.768
And this is one of hundreds of ways

00:04:34.792 --> 00:04:37.934
in which this typeface was designed
to look geometrically perfect,

00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.726
even though it's mathematically not.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.143
And this is what typeface
designers do all the time

00:04:42.167 --> 00:04:44.809
to make typefaces work, every day.

00:04:44.833 --> 00:04:48.726
Now, there were other designers doing this
at the same time in Europe and America.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.268
These are a few other
excellent examples from Europe,

00:04:51.292 --> 00:04:54.559
trying to create something new
for the new age, a new moment in time.

00:04:54.583 --> 00:04:56.351
These are some other ones in Germany

00:04:56.375 --> 00:04:58.559
that in some ways
look very similar to Futura,

00:04:58.583 --> 00:05:01.643
maybe with higher waist or lower waist
or different proportions.

00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:03.601
Then why did Futura take over the world?

00:05:03.625 --> 00:05:06.143
In this case, if you can read
the titles there,

00:05:06.167 --> 00:05:08.934
some of these names
don't quite roll off the tongue:

00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:14.309
Erbar, Kabel Light,
Berthold-Grotesk, Elegant-Grotesk.

00:05:14.333 --> 00:05:16.559
These aren't exactly
household names, are they?

00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:19.268
And so when you compare that to Futura,

00:05:19.292 --> 00:05:22.559
you realize that this was a really
good choice by the marketing team.

00:05:22.583 --> 00:05:24.309
What's amazing about this name --

00:05:24.333 --> 00:05:26.976
you know, what's in this name
is that this is a name

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.684
that actually invokes hope
and an idea about the future.

00:05:30.708 --> 00:05:33.232
And this isn't actually the word
for future in German,

00:05:33.256 --> 00:05:34.518
it wasn't a German name,

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:36.018
they actually picked something

00:05:36.042 --> 00:05:39.226
that would speak to a wider,
larger audience, a universal audience.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.101
And when you compare it
to what was being done in America --

00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:44.226
these are the typefaces
from the same period

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.893
in the United States in the 1920s,

00:05:45.917 --> 00:05:47.226
bold, brash, braggadocios.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.768
You almost think of this as exactly
like what the stock market looked like

00:05:50.792 --> 00:05:52.851
when they were all
going nuts in the 1920s.

00:05:52.875 --> 00:05:55.768
And you realize that Futura
is doing something revolutionary.

00:05:55.792 --> 00:05:59.976
I want to step back and talk
about an example of the typeface in use.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.268
So this is a magazine that we all
probably know today, "Vanity Fair."

00:06:03.292 --> 00:06:06.643
This is what it looked like
in 1929, in the summer.

00:06:06.667 --> 00:06:10.059
And in many ways, there's
nothing wrong with this design.

00:06:10.083 --> 00:06:12.684
This is absolutely typical of the 1920s.

00:06:12.708 --> 00:06:14.809
There's a photograph
of an important person,

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:17.643
in this case Franklin Roosevelt,
then-governor of New York.

00:06:17.667 --> 00:06:20.309
Everything seems centered,
everything seems symmetrical.

00:06:20.333 --> 00:06:22.434
There's still a little bit
of ornamentation,

00:06:22.458 --> 00:06:25.434
so this is still maybe having
some vestiges of the painted lady

00:06:25.458 --> 00:06:26.726
and not fully modernistic.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.393
But everything seems kid of solid.

00:06:28.417 --> 00:06:30.934
There's even drop caps
to help you get into the text.

00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.684
But this all changed very quickly
and in October of 1929,

00:06:33.708 --> 00:06:36.684
a Berlin-based designer came
and redesigned "Vanity Fair."

00:06:36.708 --> 00:06:39.893
And this is what
it looks like with Futura.

00:06:39.917 --> 00:06:41.768
Instead of the governor

00:06:41.792 --> 00:06:44.684
now we have a photograph
of an abstract, beautiful setting,

00:06:44.708 --> 00:06:46.226
in this case, the ocean.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.476
Instead of drop caps,
there's nothing at all.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.559
And replaced with a centered
layout is now asymmetry.

00:06:52.583 --> 00:06:55.643
And it gets even more radical
the further you enter the magazine.

00:06:55.667 --> 00:06:57.684
In this case,
even more dramatic asymmetry.

00:06:57.708 --> 00:07:00.976
In this case, illustrations
by Pablo Picasso, moving across the page

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.893
and breaking the gutter of the two pages.

00:07:04.917 --> 00:07:06.851
And there's something even more radical.

00:07:06.875 --> 00:07:09.809
If you look closely at the Futura,
you might notice something.

00:07:09.833 --> 00:07:11.476
You might not pick it up at first,

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.059
but there are no capital letters
in the title or the captions on this page.

00:07:15.083 --> 00:07:17.018
You might not think that's very radical,

00:07:17.042 --> 00:07:19.684
but pick up any magazine,
any book or go to any website,

00:07:19.708 --> 00:07:22.476
and I guarantee, you are not
going to find it very easily.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.893
This is still a radical idea.

00:07:24.917 --> 00:07:26.184
And why is that radical?

00:07:26.208 --> 00:07:29.184
When we think about
what capital letters denote,

00:07:29.208 --> 00:07:31.018
they denote something important,

00:07:31.042 --> 00:07:33.184
whether it's our names, or our titles.

00:07:33.208 --> 00:07:36.143
Or maybe even just
the name of our corporations,

00:07:36.167 --> 00:07:37.893
or maybe our trademarks.

00:07:37.917 --> 00:07:41.351
Actually, in some ways,
America's the home of capitalization.

00:07:41.375 --> 00:07:43.268
We love putting capitals in everything.

00:07:43.292 --> 00:07:44.934
(Laughter)

00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.934
But think about how radical this would be

00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:51.268
to introduce a magazine where you're
taking away all the capital letters.

00:07:51.292 --> 00:07:53.351
This has maybe had
the same political force

00:07:53.375 --> 00:07:57.101
that we now argue over things
like pronouns in our society today.

00:07:57.125 --> 00:07:58.684
In the 1920s,

00:07:58.708 --> 00:08:03.333
this is just shortly after Soviet Russia
had a communist revolution.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:08.893
And for them, this actually represented
a socialist infiltration into America.

00:08:08.917 --> 00:08:12.768
All lowercase letters meant
that this was an egalitarian,

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:16.809
complete lowering of everything
into one equal playing field.

00:08:16.833 --> 00:08:18.809
Now this is still kind of a radical idea.

00:08:18.833 --> 00:08:21.119
Think about how often
you do capitalize something

00:08:21.143 --> 00:08:22.934
to have more power or prestige to it.

00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:27.143
So for them to do this was a way
in which Futura was using this idea.

00:08:27.167 --> 00:08:30.351
Now, other designers
were doing other things with Futura.

00:08:30.375 --> 00:08:32.643
Others brought other ideas
of modernism with it,

00:08:32.667 --> 00:08:35.059
whether it was interesting
new illustration styles,

00:08:35.083 --> 00:08:37.934
or interesting new collage
types of illustration.

00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.018
Or even just new book covers,

00:08:40.042 --> 00:08:42.143
whether they were from Europe.

00:08:42.167 --> 00:08:44.018
But here's the funny thing.

00:08:44.042 --> 00:08:46.393
In the 1920s, if you wanted
to use a new typeface,

00:08:46.417 --> 00:08:48.851
you couldn't just go download it
onto your computer.

00:08:48.875 --> 00:08:51.058
You actually had to have pieces of lead.

00:08:51.082 --> 00:08:53.143
So for Americans who wanted to adopt this

00:08:53.167 --> 00:08:55.183
and make it part of their own system,

00:08:55.207 --> 00:08:58.059
something they could use
in everyday typography,

00:08:58.083 --> 00:08:59.726
whether in ads or anything else,

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.934
they actually had to have metal type.

00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.393
So being good American
capitalists, what did we do?

00:09:04.417 --> 00:09:05.809
We made all sorts of copies.

00:09:05.833 --> 00:09:08.143
Ones that had nothing to do
with the name Futura,

00:09:08.167 --> 00:09:10.018
but looked identical to it,

00:09:10.042 --> 00:09:11.601
whether it was Spartan or Tempo.

00:09:11.625 --> 00:09:14.351
And in fact, by the time
that World War II started,

00:09:14.375 --> 00:09:17.809
American corporations were actually trying
to boycott Nazi goods.

00:09:17.833 --> 00:09:20.309
But they said,
"Go ahead and use our copies.

00:09:20.333 --> 00:09:23.018
Use 20th Century, use Spartan,
use Vogue, use Tempo.

00:09:23.042 --> 00:09:25.351
These are identical to Futura."

00:09:25.375 --> 00:09:28.559
And in fact, for most people,
they didn't even learn the new names,

00:09:28.583 --> 00:09:30.351
they just still called it all Futura.

00:09:30.375 --> 00:09:32.934
So America took this typeface in,

00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.934
conquered it and made it its own.

00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.851
So by the time World War II finishes,

00:09:37.875 --> 00:09:39.733
Americans are using this on everything,

00:09:39.757 --> 00:09:41.976
whether it be catalogs, or atlases,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.309
or encyclopedias or charts and graphs,

00:09:45.333 --> 00:09:48.976
or calendars, or even political material.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.083
And even the logo for a new
expansion football team.

00:09:53.042 --> 00:09:56.434
And in fact, it was used even on some
of the most important advertising

00:09:56.458 --> 00:09:57.768
of the 20th century.

00:09:57.792 --> 00:09:59.101
So it's in this context

00:09:59.125 --> 00:10:01.476
that when the US government
was picking a typeface

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.120
to use after World War II
for new maps and new projects,

00:10:04.144 --> 00:10:05.393
they picked Futura.

00:10:05.417 --> 00:10:08.226
It wasn't an astounding choice,
it wasn't a radical choice,

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.393
it didn't have anything
to do with communism.

00:10:10.417 --> 00:10:13.518
But in this case, it was used
on some of the most important maps,

00:10:13.542 --> 00:10:15.393
so this one, an air force map in 1962,

00:10:15.417 --> 00:10:17.833
or used for the maps in Vietnam in '66.

00:10:18.833 --> 00:10:20.143
And so it wasn't a surprise

00:10:20.167 --> 00:10:23.226
that when astronauts
first started the Mercury program,

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.060
such as John Glenn orbiting the earth,

00:10:25.084 --> 00:10:27.684
that charts and maps
that he was using were in Futura.

00:10:27.708 --> 00:10:31.726
And in fact, by the time
Mercury morphed into Apollo,

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.351
it started getting used
more and more for more things.

00:10:34.375 --> 00:10:37.018
So in this case for a safety plan,

00:10:37.042 --> 00:10:39.643
or even starting to get used
on instrument panels,

00:10:39.667 --> 00:10:41.351
or navigational aids.

00:10:41.375 --> 00:10:44.518
Or even on diagrams
to show how the whole system worked.

00:10:44.542 --> 00:10:45.934
But here's the amazing thing,

00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:49.059
it didn't just get used for papers
that they handed out to people.

00:10:49.083 --> 00:10:51.018
It started to get used for an interface,

00:10:51.042 --> 00:10:53.268
for an entire system
that helped the astronauts

00:10:53.292 --> 00:10:54.809
know how to use the machine.

00:10:54.833 --> 00:10:58.684
NASA wasn't just one big corporation
making everything.

00:10:58.708 --> 00:11:00.559
There was hundreds of contractors --

00:11:00.583 --> 00:11:02.976
Boeing, IBM, McDonnell Douglas --

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.434
all making different machines.

00:11:04.458 --> 00:11:08.143
Now imagine if astronauts had to use
different typefaces and different systems

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:11.559
for each component they had
in the space shuttles.

00:11:11.583 --> 00:11:13.601
This would have been
impossible to navigate

00:11:13.625 --> 00:11:15.768
and there would have been
a cognitive overload

00:11:15.792 --> 00:11:17.893
every time they had
to open up a new system.

00:11:17.917 --> 00:11:20.559
So in this case, Futura
being used on the interface

00:11:20.583 --> 00:11:24.059
helped them navigate complexity
and make it more clear.

00:11:24.083 --> 00:11:27.226
And it wasn't just used on buttons,
it was used on labels,

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.060
and it was used on their food rations,

00:11:29.084 --> 00:11:31.268
and it was used on their tool kits.

00:11:31.292 --> 00:11:35.351
It was used on knobs and levers
to tell them what to do.

00:11:35.375 --> 00:11:37.226
In fact, maybe even some of the places

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:40.727
where they needed to have things
that were complex be more simple to them,

00:11:40.751 --> 00:11:43.309
instructions were printed
entirely in Futura,

00:11:43.333 --> 00:11:45.976
so that they could know
what to do with that one moment.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.559
They didn't have to remember
everything in their head,

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:51.518
they could have it out there
in the world to see and refer to.

00:11:51.542 --> 00:11:53.684
In this case, Futura helped
make that system,

00:11:53.708 --> 00:11:57.018
which was already
a very difficult and complex system,

00:11:57.042 --> 00:11:58.417
a little less complex.

00:11:59.083 --> 00:12:02.226
In fact, the very first or last thing
an astronaut might have seen

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.559
when they were entering
or exiting the spacecraft

00:12:04.583 --> 00:12:05.851
would have been in Futura.

00:12:05.875 --> 00:12:09.018
One of my favorite examples
of how Futura worked in this way

00:12:09.042 --> 00:12:10.351
is actually this camera.

00:12:10.375 --> 00:12:14.601
This is a Hasselblad
that was made by the Swedish company.

00:12:14.625 --> 00:12:17.559
It's a perfectly good camera,
some of you might have used one,

00:12:17.583 --> 00:12:21.434
it's prized by photographers
as a really great camera.

00:12:21.458 --> 00:12:24.143
And you might notice,
if you know anything about cameras,

00:12:24.167 --> 00:12:26.226
that there's some
modifications made to it.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:29.476
In this case, there are stickers
placed all over the film canisters,

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.226
or other parts of the camera here.

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:34.309
What this enabled NASA to do,

00:12:34.333 --> 00:12:37.809
was make something really great
out of the astronauts.

00:12:37.833 --> 00:12:40.518
They're not photographers,
they're not experts in art.

00:12:40.542 --> 00:12:43.684
But they could ensure that they
would know how to use this camera

00:12:43.708 --> 00:12:45.893
because of the labels
placed there in Futura.

00:12:45.917 --> 00:12:47.184
So in this case,

00:12:47.208 --> 00:12:51.018
Futura acquired and made sure
that they had legitimacy

00:12:51.042 --> 00:12:52.643
with the things they were using.

00:12:52.667 --> 00:12:55.809
In this case to not take off the film
before it would expose.

00:12:55.833 --> 00:12:57.934
Which, in this case,
we would have never had

00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.476
some of the amazing photos we had
without this label.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:06.101
When we see something as decorative
as this, a ceremonial patch,

00:13:06.125 --> 00:13:08.309
or something like this plaque on the moon,

00:13:08.333 --> 00:13:11.434
we realize that Futura was more
than just something ceremonial,

00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:16.101
something more than something
that had just been picked for its design.

00:13:16.125 --> 00:13:18.809
In fact, Futura had authority,

00:13:18.833 --> 00:13:21.309
had legitimacy and had power
because of this choice.

00:13:21.333 --> 00:13:24.518
There's one other thing
I want to talk about in closing.

00:13:24.542 --> 00:13:28.018
And that is that Futura tells a story.

00:13:28.042 --> 00:13:32.226
And this is what I love about typefaces,
is that all of them tell stories.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:35.059
And in this case, this typeface
tells a very powerful story

00:13:35.083 --> 00:13:38.476
about assimilation, about something
being taken into America

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.934
and being made part of its culture.

00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.684
And that's one of the best
and worst things America does,

00:13:43.708 --> 00:13:46.809
is we take things into our culture
and we spit them out back again

00:13:46.833 --> 00:13:48.101
and claim them our own.

00:13:48.125 --> 00:13:51.726
And in this case, Futura mirrors
exactly what happened with the technology

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.393
undergirding the whole system.

00:13:53.417 --> 00:13:57.851
Futura was a German typeface,
taken in, made into an American commodity.

00:13:57.875 --> 00:13:59.309
And so were the technologies:

00:13:59.333 --> 00:14:02.101
the rockets, the scientists
all came from Germany as well.

00:14:02.125 --> 00:14:05.351
So in some ways, this German typeface
on an American plaque

00:14:05.375 --> 00:14:07.809
perfectly mirrors what happened
with the technology.

00:14:07.833 --> 00:14:09.101
And in this case,

00:14:09.125 --> 00:14:14.601
when you think about this story,
you realize that typography on the moon

00:14:14.625 --> 00:14:17.476
represents legitimacy,
represents authority,

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.184
and this gave them, the astronauts,
the power to get to the moon.

00:14:21.208 --> 00:14:22.476
Thank you.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.083
(Applause)
