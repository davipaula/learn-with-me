00:00:06.802 --> 00:00:08.087
Muscles.

00:00:08.087 --> 00:00:10.404
We have over 600 of them.

00:00:10.404 --> 00:00:14.348
They make up between 
1/3 and 1/2 of our body weight,

00:00:14.348 --> 00:00:16.016
and along with connective tissue,

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:20.261
they bind us together, hold us up,
and help us move.

00:00:20.261 --> 00:00:22.852
And whether or not body building
is your hobby,

00:00:22.852 --> 00:00:25.265
muscles need your constant attention

00:00:25.265 --> 00:00:27.579
because the way you treat 
them on a daily basis

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.048
determines whether 
they will wither or grow.

00:00:31.048 --> 00:00:34.158
Say you're standing in front of a door,
ready to pull it open.

00:00:34.158 --> 00:00:39.077
Your brain and muscles are perfectly
poised to help you achieve this goal.

00:00:39.077 --> 00:00:43.121
First, your brain sends a signal
to motor neurons inside your arm.

00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:45.937
When they receive this message,
they fire,

00:00:45.937 --> 00:00:49.051
causing muscles to contract and relax,

00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:53.414
which pull on the bones in your arm
and generate the needed movement.

00:00:53.414 --> 00:00:57.460
The bigger the challenge becomes,
the bigger the brain's signal grows,

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.445
and the more motor units it rallies
to help you achieve your task.

00:01:01.445 --> 00:01:04.818
But what if the door 
is made of solid iron?

00:01:04.818 --> 00:01:06.773
At this point, your arm muscles alone

00:01:06.773 --> 00:01:10.394
won't be able to generate 
enough tension to pull it open,

00:01:10.394 --> 00:01:13.868
so your brain appeals 
to other muscles for help.

00:01:13.868 --> 00:01:17.795
You plant your feet, tighten your belly,
and tense your back,

00:01:17.795 --> 00:01:20.439
generating enough force to yank it open.

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.749
Your nervous system has just leveraged
the resources you already have,

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:26.387
other muscles,

00:01:26.387 --> 00:01:27.634
to meet the demand.

00:01:27.634 --> 00:01:28.973
While all this is happening,

00:01:28.973 --> 00:01:32.945
your muscle fibers undergo 
another kind of cellular change.

00:01:32.945 --> 00:01:37.538
As you expose them to stress,
they experience microscopic damage,

00:01:37.538 --> 00:01:40.333
which, in this context, is a good thing.

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:45.808
In response, the injured cells release
inflammatory molecules called cytokines

00:01:45.808 --> 00:01:50.112
that activate the immune system
to repair the injury.

00:01:50.112 --> 00:01:53.524
This is when the muscle-building 
magic happens.

00:01:53.524 --> 00:01:55.895
The greater the damage 
to the muscle tissue,

00:01:55.895 --> 00:01:59.114
the more your body 
will need to repair itself.

00:01:59.114 --> 00:02:01.644
The resulting cycle of damage and repair

00:02:01.644 --> 00:02:04.829
eventually makes muscles 
bigger and stronger

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.299
as they adapt to progressively 
greater demands.

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.983
Since our bodies have already adapted
to most everyday activities,

00:02:11.983 --> 00:02:14.682
those generally don't produce 
enough stress

00:02:14.682 --> 00:02:17.213
to stimulate new muscle growth.

00:02:17.213 --> 00:02:20.565
So, to build new muscle,
a process called hypertrophy,

00:02:20.565 --> 00:02:25.247
our cells need to be exposed to higher
workloads than they are used to.

00:02:25.247 --> 00:02:29.615
In fact, if you don't continuously expose
your muscles to some resistance,

00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:31.252
they will shrink,

00:02:31.252 --> 00:02:34.325
a process known as muscular atrophy.

00:02:34.325 --> 00:02:37.700
In contrast, exposing the muscle
to a high-degree of tension,

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.483
especially while 
the muscle is lengthening,

00:02:40.483 --> 00:02:42.861
also called an eccentric contraction,

00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:46.526
generates effective conditions
for new growth.

00:02:46.526 --> 00:02:50.304
However, muscles rely on more than
just activity to grow.

00:02:50.304 --> 00:02:53.038
Without proper nutrition, 
hormones, and rest,

00:02:53.038 --> 00:02:56.635
your body would never be able
to repair damaged muscle fibers.

00:02:56.635 --> 00:02:59.574
Protein in our diet preserves muscle mass

00:02:59.574 --> 00:03:02.465
by providing the building 
blocks for new tissue

00:03:02.465 --> 00:03:04.389
in the form of amino acids.

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:08.020
Adequate protein intake,
along with naturally occurring hormones,

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.097
like insulin-like growth factor
and testosterone,

00:03:11.097 --> 00:03:16.134
help shift the body into a state
where tissue is repaired and grown.

00:03:16.134 --> 00:03:19.896
This vital repair process mainly occurs
when we're resting,

00:03:19.896 --> 00:03:22.110
especially at night while sleeping.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.255
Gender and age 
affect this repair mechanism,

00:03:25.255 --> 00:03:27.731
which is why young men 
with more testosterone

00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:30.482
have a leg up in the muscle building game.

00:03:30.482 --> 00:03:34.631
Genetic factors also play a role
in one's ability to grow muscle.

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:38.479
Some people have more robust 
immune reactions to muscle damage,

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:42.015
and are better able to repair
and replace damaged muscle fibers,

00:03:42.015 --> 00:03:44.901
increasing their 
muscle-building potential.

00:03:44.901 --> 00:03:47.596
The body responds to the demands
you place on it.

00:03:47.596 --> 00:03:52.370
If you tear your muscles up,
eat right, rest and repeat,

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.185
you'll create the conditions to make your
muscles as big and strong as possible.

00:03:57.185 --> 00:03:59.566
It is with muscles as it is with life:

00:03:59.566 --> 00:04:03.292
Meaningful growth requires challenge
and stress.
