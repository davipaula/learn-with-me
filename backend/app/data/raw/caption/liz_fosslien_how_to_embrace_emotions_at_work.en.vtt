00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:13.882
No matter how hard you might try,

00:00:13.906 --> 00:00:16.875
you can't just flip a switch
when you step into the office

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:18.282
and turn your emotions off.

00:00:18.306 --> 00:00:21.341
Feeling feelings is part of being human.

00:00:21.365 --> 00:00:24.279
[The Way We Work]

00:00:25.816 --> 00:00:29.642
A pervasive myth exists
that emotions don't belong at work,

00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.032
and this often leads us

00:00:31.056 --> 00:00:35.212
to mistakenly equate professionalism
with being stoic or even cold.

00:00:35.236 --> 00:00:37.975
But research shows that in the moments
when our colleagues

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:40.122
drop their glossy
professional presentation,

00:00:40.146 --> 00:00:43.303
we're actually much more likely
to believe what they're telling us.

00:00:43.327 --> 00:00:45.327
We feel connected to the people around us.

00:00:45.351 --> 00:00:47.479
We try harder, we perform better

00:00:47.503 --> 00:00:49.530
and we're just generally kinder.

00:00:49.554 --> 00:00:53.242
So it's about time that we learn
how to embrace emotion at work.

00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.142
Now, that's not to say

00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.633
you should suddenly become
a feelings fire hose.

00:00:58.014 --> 00:01:01.299
A line exists between sharing,
which builds trust,

00:01:01.323 --> 00:01:03.722
and oversharing, which destroys it.

00:01:03.746 --> 00:01:07.306
If you suddenly let your feelings
run wild at work

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.232
and give people far more information
than they bargained for,

00:01:10.256 --> 00:01:12.362
you make everyone around you uncomfortable

00:01:12.386 --> 00:01:13.932
and you also undermine yourself.

00:01:13.956 --> 00:01:17.565
You're more likely to be seen as weak
or lacking self awareness,

00:01:17.589 --> 00:01:20.986
so, great to say you weren't
feeling well last night --

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.142
you don't need to go
into every lurid detail

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:26.492
about how you got reacquainted
with your half-digested dinner.

00:01:26.516 --> 00:01:29.432
So there's a wide spectrum
of emotional expression.

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:31.872
On one hand, you have under-emoters,

00:01:31.896 --> 00:01:34.706
or people who have a hard time
talking about their feelings,

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.632
and on the other end are over-emoters,

00:01:37.656 --> 00:01:41.985
those who constantly share everything
that's going on inside,

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.372
and neither of these make
for a healthy workplace.

00:01:44.396 --> 00:01:46.982
So what's the balance
between these two extremes?

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:49.672
It's something called
selective vulnerability.

00:01:49.696 --> 00:01:52.561
Selective vulnerability is opening up

00:01:52.585 --> 00:01:56.582
while still prioritizing stability
and psychological safety,

00:01:56.606 --> 00:01:58.912
both for you and for your colleagues.

00:01:58.936 --> 00:02:00.601
Luckily, anyone can learn

00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:03.083
to be selectively
vulnerable, with practice.

00:02:03.107 --> 00:02:04.882
Here are four ways to get started.

00:02:04.906 --> 00:02:08.832
First, flag your feelings
without becoming emotionally leaky.

00:02:08.856 --> 00:02:10.362
Bad moods are contagious,

00:02:10.386 --> 00:02:12.910
and even if you're not vocalizing
what you're feeling,

00:02:12.934 --> 00:02:16.092
chances are your body language
or your expressions

00:02:16.116 --> 00:02:17.392
are a dead giveaway.

00:02:17.416 --> 00:02:20.442
So if you are crossing your arms
or hammering on your keyboard,

00:02:20.466 --> 00:02:23.141
your coworkers are going
to know you're upset.

00:02:23.165 --> 00:02:24.672
And if you don't say anything,

00:02:24.696 --> 00:02:27.542
they might start to think
it's about them and get worried.

00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:30.582
So if you are reacting
to a non-work-related event,

00:02:30.606 --> 00:02:33.122
so traffic for example, just flag it.

00:02:33.146 --> 00:02:34.902
You don't need to go into detail.

00:02:34.926 --> 00:02:38.306
You can say something as simple as
"I'm having a bad morning.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.822
It has nothing to do with you."

00:02:39.846 --> 00:02:41.412
Now if it's a work-related event

00:02:41.436 --> 00:02:43.901
that's causing you
to feel strong emotions,

00:02:43.925 --> 00:02:45.612
that brings us to point number two.

00:02:45.636 --> 00:02:48.485
Try to understand
the need behind your emotion,

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:49.832
and then address that need.

00:02:49.856 --> 00:02:54.373
If you suddenly start to find
everyone around you irritating,

00:02:54.397 --> 00:02:55.932
sit back and reflect on that.

00:02:55.956 --> 00:02:58.862
And it might be that you're irritable
because you're anxious,

00:02:58.886 --> 00:03:02.458
and you're anxious because you're worried
about hitting a looming deadline.

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:04.625
And in that case, you
can go back to your team

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:06.702
to address that need
and say something like,

00:03:06.726 --> 00:03:09.807
"I want to make sure I get everything
done ahead of the deadline.

00:03:09.831 --> 00:03:12.543
Can you help me put together
a realistic plan to do that?"

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:14.140
If you're thinking of sharing,

00:03:14.164 --> 00:03:16.531
try and put yourself in
the other person's shoes.

00:03:16.555 --> 00:03:20.729
So if what you're about to say
would help you feel more supported

00:03:20.753 --> 00:03:22.857
and better understand the situation,

00:03:22.881 --> 00:03:24.436
then go ahead and share it.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.062
But if it gives you any kind of pause,
you might want to leave it out.

00:03:28.086 --> 00:03:31.182
And finally, read the room
and provide a path forward.

00:03:31.206 --> 00:03:34.149
If everyone on your team
has been pulling long hours,

00:03:34.173 --> 00:03:39.274
and you notice that one of your colleagues
seems particularly deflated or anxious,

00:03:39.298 --> 00:03:41.502
you can acknowledge that
and show some empathy,

00:03:41.526 --> 00:03:43.702
but then try to give
them something actionable

00:03:43.726 --> 00:03:45.033
that they could hold on to.

00:03:45.057 --> 00:03:46.208
And in this case,

00:03:46.232 --> 00:03:48.352
you could suggest that
you go to your manager

00:03:48.376 --> 00:03:49.902
and ask that your weekly meeting

00:03:49.926 --> 00:03:52.672
be pushed back a day
so you both have more time to work.

00:03:52.696 --> 00:03:54.982
You're showing you're invested
in their success,

00:03:55.006 --> 00:03:57.149
but also that you care
about their well-being.

00:03:57.173 --> 00:03:59.212
When we can be honest about what we feel,

00:03:59.236 --> 00:04:02.045
and freely suggest ideas, make mistakes

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.219
and just not have to hide
every piece of who we are,

00:04:05.243 --> 00:04:08.521
we're much more likely
to stay at the company for a long time.

00:04:08.545 --> 00:04:11.060
We're also happier and more productive.

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:14.872
So take a moment to reflect
on the emotional expression

00:04:14.896 --> 00:04:16.925
that you bring to work each day.

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.052
And if you are prone
to oversharing, try editing.

00:04:20.076 --> 00:04:22.102
And if you're a little bit more reserved,

00:04:22.126 --> 00:04:24.812
look for moments when you can
open up to your colleagues

00:04:24.836 --> 00:04:26.026
and be a bit vulnerable.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.351
And chances are,
there will be a big difference

00:04:28.375 --> 00:04:29.982
in how people respond to you.

00:04:30.006 --> 00:04:32.432
And selective vulnerability
might just become

00:04:32.456 --> 00:04:34.571
one of your most valuable tools.
