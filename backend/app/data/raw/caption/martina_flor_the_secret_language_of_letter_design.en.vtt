00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.151
Can you imagine what the word
"TED" would have looked like

00:00:16.175 --> 00:00:18.278
if it had existed during the Roman Empire?

00:00:20.337 --> 00:00:22.297
I think maybe something like this.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:30.520
An artisan would have spent days
in the sun chiseling it into stone.

00:00:31.063 --> 00:00:32.648
And in the Middle Ages?

00:00:34.975 --> 00:00:38.845
A monk, locked in his room,

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:44.439
would write T-E-D with his pen.

00:00:45.588 --> 00:00:47.433
And without going so far back in time,

00:00:47.457 --> 00:00:49.824
how would these letters
have looked in the 80s?

00:00:53.358 --> 00:00:56.536
They would have had
electric, strange colors,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.227
just like our hairstyles.

00:00:58.251 --> 00:00:59.885
(Laughter)

00:01:00.612 --> 00:01:03.377
If this event were about children,

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.680
I would draw the letters like this,

00:01:07.482 --> 00:01:09.985
as if they were building blocks,

00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:12.474
in vivid colors.

00:01:12.498 --> 00:01:15.561
And if it were about superheroes instead?

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.020
I would do them like this,

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:21.955
inspired by -- in my opinion --
the greatest of all:

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:23.533
Superman.

00:01:23.557 --> 00:01:25.051
(Laughter)

00:01:25.075 --> 00:01:28.256
The shapes of these letters talk.

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:32.787
They tell us things
beyond what they represent.

00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:35.859
They send us to different eras,

00:01:35.883 --> 00:01:37.885
they convey values,

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.029
they tell us stories.

00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:45.572
If we think about it,
our days are full of letters.

00:01:45.596 --> 00:01:47.632
We see them on the front of the bus,

00:01:47.656 --> 00:01:49.878
on the bakery's facade,

00:01:49.902 --> 00:01:51.841
on the keyboard we write on,

00:01:51.865 --> 00:01:53.608
on our cell phones --

00:01:53.632 --> 00:01:55.107
everywhere.

00:01:56.566 --> 00:01:58.072
Since the beginning of history,

00:01:58.096 --> 00:02:01.415
people have felt the need
to give language an image.

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.095
And rightly so,

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.575
because language is the most important
communication tool we have.

00:02:08.984 --> 00:02:11.506
Without understanding what a word means,

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.994
we can see certain things it conveys.

00:02:15.572 --> 00:02:17.881
Some letters tell us
that something is modern --

00:02:17.905 --> 00:02:20.273
at least it was back in the 70s.

00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:27.047
Others verify the importance
and monumentality of a place,

00:02:27.071 --> 00:02:28.764
and they do so in uppercase.

00:02:29.298 --> 00:02:32.229
There are letters not made to last long --

00:02:32.253 --> 00:02:35.531
and neither is the opportunity
they communicate.

00:02:36.067 --> 00:02:39.427
And there are letters made
by inexperienced hands

00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:41.150
that, whether they mean to or not,

00:02:41.174 --> 00:02:43.744
make us imagine
what a place looks like inside.

00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:48.824
When I moved to Berlin,
I experienced firsthand

00:02:48.848 --> 00:02:53.242
all the impact that drawn letters
can have in our day-to-day life.

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:58.183
I arrived in a new city, which was
exciting and novel for me.

00:02:58.207 --> 00:03:04.908
Now, dealing with an unfamiliar language
was at times very frustrating

00:03:04.932 --> 00:03:06.345
and uncomfortable.

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:11.079
I found myself several times at parties
clutching my glass of wine,

00:03:11.103 --> 00:03:15.756
without understanding a single word
of what was being said around me.

00:03:17.214 --> 00:03:20.426
And of course, I'd smile
as if I understood everything.

00:03:22.386 --> 00:03:26.005
I felt limited in my ability
to say what I thought,

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:28.329
what I felt,

00:03:29.802 --> 00:03:30.952
what I believed.

00:03:33.316 --> 00:03:35.587
Not only did I not understand
the conversations,

00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:40.221
but the streets were full of signs
and text that I couldn't read.

00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:46.080
But the shapes of the letters
gave me clues;

00:03:46.104 --> 00:03:48.537
they would open up a little window

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:52.290
to understanding the stories
enclosed in those shapes.

00:03:54.365 --> 00:03:57.269
I recognized places
where tradition was important.

00:03:57.293 --> 00:03:59.740
[Bakery Pastries Café Restaurant]

00:03:59.764 --> 00:04:02.637
Or I'd know when someone
was trying to give me a signal,

00:04:02.661 --> 00:04:05.600
and my gut would tell me
it was better to stay away.

00:04:05.624 --> 00:04:07.406
[No trespassing!]

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.283
I could also tell when something
was made to last forever.

00:04:10.307 --> 00:04:13.628
The shapes of letters helped me
understand my surroundings better

00:04:13.652 --> 00:04:14.984
and navigate the city.

00:04:15.563 --> 00:04:17.469
I was in Paris recently,

00:04:17.493 --> 00:04:19.685
and something similar happened to me.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.808
After a few days in the city,

00:04:21.832 --> 00:04:25.409
I was on the lookout for something
tasty to take back home.

00:04:25.433 --> 00:04:30.380
So I walked and walked and walked
until I found the perfect bakery.

00:04:31.132 --> 00:04:32.769
The sign said it all.

00:04:32.793 --> 00:04:34.444
[Bakery]

00:04:34.468 --> 00:04:37.567
I see it, and even today,
I imagine the master baker

00:04:37.591 --> 00:04:40.503
dedicating the same amount of time
to each loaf of bread

00:04:40.527 --> 00:04:43.654
that the craftsman dedicated
to each letter of this word.

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:48.206
I can see the bread,
with just the right ingredients,

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.688
being kneaded softly and carefully,

00:04:50.712 --> 00:04:54.816
in the same way the craftsman
drew the ends of the letters

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.523
with smooth and precise curves.

00:04:58.565 --> 00:05:03.688
I see the master baker placing
the buns over a thin layer of flour

00:05:03.712 --> 00:05:05.664
so the bottoms don't burn.

00:05:05.688 --> 00:05:10.783
I think of the craftsman putting
the mosaics in the oven one by one,

00:05:10.807 --> 00:05:12.913
being careful to not let the ink run.

00:05:14.541 --> 00:05:17.232
The love for detail
that the master baker has

00:05:18.027 --> 00:05:22.705
is reflected in the attention
that went into creating this sign.

00:05:23.746 --> 00:05:27.705
Without having tried their bread,
we already imagine it tastes good.

00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:31.311
And I can vouch for it; it was delicious.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.636
I'm a letterer; that's my job --

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.001
to draw letters.

00:05:39.328 --> 00:05:43.414
Just like when you make bread,
it requires care in its preparation,

00:05:43.438 --> 00:05:45.961
just the right amount of ingredients

00:05:45.985 --> 00:05:47.490
and love for the details.

00:05:48.585 --> 00:05:52.686
Our alphabet is at the same time
my raw material and my limitation.

00:05:53.251 --> 00:05:56.524
The basic structure of the letters
is for me a playing field,

00:05:56.548 --> 00:06:01.340
where the only rule is that the reader,
at the end of the road,

00:06:01.364 --> 00:06:03.110
will be able to read the message.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.803
Let me show you how I work,

00:06:06.827 --> 00:06:08.722
how I "knead my bread."

00:06:10.388 --> 00:06:14.956
A while back, I was commissioned
to design the cover of a classic book,

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.994
"Alice in Wonderland."

00:06:18.016 --> 00:06:19.739
Alice falls in a burrow

00:06:19.763 --> 00:06:23.001
and begins an absurd journey
through a world of fantasy, remember?

00:06:24.415 --> 00:06:29.144
In this situation, the title of the story
is my raw material.

00:06:31.046 --> 00:06:34.340
At first glance, there are elements
that are not very important,

00:06:34.364 --> 00:06:36.248
and I can decide to make them smaller.

00:06:36.272 --> 00:06:40.467
For example, I'll write "in"
on a smaller scale.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.249
Then I'll try some other ideas.

00:06:43.273 --> 00:06:45.834
What if, to communicate
the idea of "wonder,"

00:06:45.858 --> 00:06:48.926
I used my best handwriting,

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.147
with lots of curleycues here and there?

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.721
Or what if I focused more on the fact
that the book is a classic

00:06:56.745 --> 00:07:00.094
and used more conventional lettering,

00:07:00.118 --> 00:07:03.998
making everything look
a little more stiff and serious,

00:07:04.022 --> 00:07:07.258
like in an encyclopedia or old books?

00:07:08.847 --> 00:07:13.719
Or how would it look, considering
this book has so much gibberish,

00:07:13.743 --> 00:07:17.579
if I combined both universes
in a single arrangement:

00:07:18.378 --> 00:07:23.700
rigid letters and smooth letters
living together in the same composition.

00:07:25.496 --> 00:07:28.716
I like this idea,
and I'll work on it in detail.

00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:33.873
I use another sheet of paper
to work more comfortably.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.752
I mark some guidelines,

00:07:36.776 --> 00:07:40.740
delimiting the framework
where the words will be.

00:07:41.923 --> 00:07:44.548
There, I can start giving
form to each letter.

00:07:44.572 --> 00:07:46.204
I work carefully.

00:07:46.638 --> 00:07:50.733
I dedicate time to each letter
without losing sight of the whole.

00:07:51.974 --> 00:07:54.495
I draw the ends
of the letters methodically.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.098
Are they square or round?

00:07:58.986 --> 00:08:02.462
Are they pointy or plump and smooth?

00:08:04.213 --> 00:08:05.827
I always make several sketches,

00:08:05.851 --> 00:08:09.772
where I'll try different ideas
or change elements.

00:08:10.459 --> 00:08:14.906
And there comes a point when
the drawing turns into precise forms,

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:18.992
with colors, volumes
and decorative elements.

00:08:19.783 --> 00:08:23.089
Alice, the celebrity here,
is placed at the front

00:08:23.113 --> 00:08:24.721
with volume in her letters.

00:08:25.545 --> 00:08:28.743
Lots of points and lines
playing in the background

00:08:28.767 --> 00:08:32.700
help me convey that in this story,
lots of things happen.

00:08:32.724 --> 00:08:35.149
And it helps to represent
the feeling it generates,

00:08:35.173 --> 00:08:37.681
as if you had your head in the clouds.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:45.384
And of course, there's Alice,
looking at her wonderland.

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:53.636
Drawing the letters of this title,
I recreate the text's atmosphere a little.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:57.375
I let the reader see the story
through a peephole in the door.

00:08:58.681 --> 00:09:01.181
To do that, I gave shape
to concepts and ideas

00:09:01.205 --> 00:09:03.156
that already exist in our imagination:

00:09:04.047 --> 00:09:05.413
the idea of dreams,

00:09:06.148 --> 00:09:07.333
of chaos,

00:09:07.802 --> 00:09:09.314
the concept of wonder.

00:09:12.284 --> 00:09:17.025
The typography and the shape of letters
work a bit like gestures

00:09:17.049 --> 00:09:18.793
and tone of voice.

00:09:18.817 --> 00:09:20.300
It's not the same to say,

00:09:21.541 --> 00:09:24.861
(In a flat tone of voice)
"TEDxRíodelaPlata's audience is huge,"

00:09:24.885 --> 00:09:30.098
as it is to say (In an animated voice),
"TEDxRíodelaPlata's audience is huge!"

00:09:31.713 --> 00:09:35.756
Gestures and tone are part of the message.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.690
By giving shape to the letters,

00:09:38.714 --> 00:09:42.702
I can decide more precisely
what I mean to say and how,

00:09:42.726 --> 00:09:44.483
beyond the literal text.

00:09:47.397 --> 00:09:51.721
I can say my favorite swear word
in a very flowery way

00:09:53.801 --> 00:09:56.088
and be really corny
when I talk about love.

00:09:58.541 --> 00:10:01.950
I can talk loudly and in a grandiose way

00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:07.148
or in a soft and poetic voice.

00:10:09.581 --> 00:10:12.450
And I can communicate the difference
between Buenos Aires

00:10:15.275 --> 00:10:16.616
and Berlin,

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.576
two cities I know very well.

00:10:23.089 --> 00:10:27.785
It was precisely in Berlin
where my work became more colorful,

00:10:27.809 --> 00:10:29.132
more expressive,

00:10:30.008 --> 00:10:32.332
more precise at telling stories.

00:10:33.441 --> 00:10:36.079
Everything I couldn't say
at those parties,

00:10:36.103 --> 00:10:38.853
standing there holding my glass of wine,

00:10:38.877 --> 00:10:42.816
exploded in shapes and colors on paper.

00:10:44.379 --> 00:10:47.857
Without my realizing it,
this limitation that language has

00:10:47.881 --> 00:10:49.424
became an engine

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:54.549
that propelled me to perfect the tools
with which I could express myself.

00:10:55.672 --> 00:10:57.541
If I couldn't say it by speaking,

00:10:58.164 --> 00:11:01.131
this was my way of talking

00:11:01.155 --> 00:11:02.978
and telling things to the world.

00:11:05.398 --> 00:11:09.536
Since then, my big quest
has been to find my own voice

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:15.160
and to tell stories with the exact
tone and gesture I want.

00:11:15.957 --> 00:11:17.789
No more, no less.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.618
That's why I combine colors,

00:11:23.487 --> 00:11:25.002
textures

00:11:25.026 --> 00:11:27.556
and of course, letters,

00:11:28.632 --> 00:11:29.970
which are the heart.

00:11:31.183 --> 00:11:35.079
And that's why I always want them to have
shapes that are truly beautiful

00:11:36.435 --> 00:11:37.677
and exquisite.

00:11:38.879 --> 00:11:41.583
Telling stories by drawing letters --

00:11:41.607 --> 00:11:43.049
that's my job.

00:11:44.501 --> 00:11:46.872
And with that I look for
a reaction in the reader,

00:11:46.896 --> 00:11:49.248
to wake them up somehow,

00:11:49.272 --> 00:11:51.085
to make them dream,

00:11:51.109 --> 00:11:52.528
make them feel moved.

00:11:54.203 --> 00:11:57.255
I believe that
if the message is important,

00:11:57.279 --> 00:11:59.369
it requires work and craftsmanship.

00:12:00.314 --> 00:12:02.548
And if the reader is important,

00:12:03.365 --> 00:12:07.690
