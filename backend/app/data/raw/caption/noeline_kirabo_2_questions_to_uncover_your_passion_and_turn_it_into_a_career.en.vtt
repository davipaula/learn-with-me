00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:15.976
When you have a job that pays you enough
to cover your basic needs,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.684
your bills and even some more to spend,

00:00:18.708 --> 00:00:20.726
the assumption is that you'd be happy,

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.625
or, even better, fulfilled.

00:00:23.542 --> 00:00:25.893
And it seems unthinkable
when you wake up and say

00:00:25.917 --> 00:00:28.708
you're going to leave a job like that
to pursue a passion.

00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:32.000
And that was my dilemma six years ago.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.434
I had a comfortable job,
I lived a comfortable life,

00:00:36.458 --> 00:00:39.184
and people expected me to be fulfilled,

00:00:39.208 --> 00:00:40.809
but I wasn't.

00:00:40.833 --> 00:00:43.643
There was something
in me that wanted more.

00:00:43.667 --> 00:00:47.268
There was a misalignment
between the things I did on a daily basis

00:00:47.292 --> 00:00:49.583
and the things that I deeply cared about.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.684
And so I decided to quit

00:00:52.708 --> 00:00:56.708
and explore the possibility of bringing
this passion into my daily routine.

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:00.643
And the thing about finding your passion

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:02.643
is that it's not straightforward.

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:04.601
Even for people with money and degrees,

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:07.333
they still struggle
to identify their passion.

00:01:08.208 --> 00:01:11.143
And here I was as a 30-year-old,

00:01:11.167 --> 00:01:13.268
talking about finding my passion

00:01:13.292 --> 00:01:14.958
and turning it into a career.

00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.268
Literally, people told me,

00:01:17.292 --> 00:01:20.559
"You don't talk about passion
until you've made enough money --

00:01:20.583 --> 00:01:22.351
(Laughter)

00:01:22.375 --> 00:01:24.708
or at least until
you're ready to retire."

00:01:26.292 --> 00:01:28.393
Because there's a notion
that looking inward

00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:31.768
and finding the things that give us
pleasure and fulfillment

00:01:31.792 --> 00:01:35.184
is a luxury that only the rich can enjoy,

00:01:35.208 --> 00:01:39.125
or a pleasure that only
the retired can indulge in.

00:01:39.792 --> 00:01:41.476
Which made me wonder:

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.500
Is passion only for the rich,

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.292
or an experience
only the retired can enjoy?

00:01:47.917 --> 00:01:51.184
For many of us, we've been led to believe

00:01:51.208 --> 00:01:53.375
that life is a race of survival.

00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:56.726
We've been conditioned
to see ourselves as survivors

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.000
that must do everything
in our power to survive.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.059
In Africa, we're nurtured to go
through school, cram and pass,

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:07.351
in the hope that you get a job after.

00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:11.268
And if you do, stick at it
no matter how much it sucks.

00:02:11.292 --> 00:02:12.684
(Laughter)

00:02:12.708 --> 00:02:15.708
Until you get a better offer
or you're asked to retire.

00:02:18.208 --> 00:02:19.601
And as a dropout,

00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:22.434
I knew that I was
not entitled to anything.

00:02:22.458 --> 00:02:24.875
Every opportunity was a privilege.

00:02:26.292 --> 00:02:28.768
And so when I thought about quitting,

00:02:28.792 --> 00:02:30.042
it was a huge risk.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.101
I was given two alternatives,

00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:35.018
which are the most popular in Africa.

00:02:35.042 --> 00:02:39.500
The first one is sign up for any course
at a vocational institution and do it.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.351
My second option,
settle for any job offer you can get,

00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:46.559
no matter the working conditions,

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:48.018
and do it.

00:02:48.042 --> 00:02:51.018
That probably explains why we have
so many of our young people

00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:53.583
being trafficked
in search of greener pastures.

00:02:54.667 --> 00:02:56.684
I opted for the first option.

00:02:56.708 --> 00:02:59.268
I did look at a couple
vocational institutions

00:02:59.292 --> 00:03:02.851
in the hope that I would find a course
that resonated with my persona,

00:03:02.875 --> 00:03:05.208
my dream and my aspiration.

00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:09.976
I was disappointed to learn that there
was no room for misfits like me

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.292
in these institutions.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.476
The education system
in many parts of the world

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.184
has been designed
around preselected options

00:03:17.208 --> 00:03:21.726
that young people are expected
to fit in or risk becoming misfits.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.851
And so going through school,
I was nurtured and conditioned

00:03:24.875 --> 00:03:28.250
to think in the straight line
and stay within the straight line.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:32.226
But when I dropped out,
I discovered a world of possibilities.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.958
I knew I could be anything,
I could study anything,

00:03:35.708 --> 00:03:37.976
and so I leveraged free online courses.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.101
That's how I built my CV,
got into employment

00:03:41.125 --> 00:03:43.059
and worked for eight years.

00:03:43.083 --> 00:03:44.559
And after eight years,

00:03:44.583 --> 00:03:47.059
I told myself there must be more to life

00:03:47.083 --> 00:03:49.768
than just going through
the routines of life.

00:03:49.792 --> 00:03:53.684
So in 2014, I started
an organization called Kyusa

00:03:53.708 --> 00:03:55.809
where we are working
with out-of-school youth

00:03:55.833 --> 00:03:58.018
and empowering them to turn their passions

00:03:58.042 --> 00:04:01.934
into profitable, scalable
and sustainable businesses.

00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.684
Now, when we talk about passion,

00:04:03.708 --> 00:04:07.976
one of the most common questions
that people ask is, "What is passion?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.143
How do I even find it?"

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:12.184
And in the simplest definition,

00:04:12.208 --> 00:04:14.684
passion is a collection
of your life experiences

00:04:14.708 --> 00:04:17.583
that give you the deepest
sense of fulfillment.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.292
And to identify your passion,
you need to look inward.

00:04:22.292 --> 00:04:24.458
So we use two reflective questions.

00:04:25.333 --> 00:04:27.393
The first question we ask is,

00:04:27.417 --> 00:04:30.143
"If you had all the time
and the money in the world,

00:04:30.167 --> 00:04:32.559
what would you spend your time doing?"

00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:34.643
It sounds like a very simple question,

00:04:34.667 --> 00:04:37.184
but many people struggle
to answer this question

00:04:37.208 --> 00:04:39.976
because they've just
never thought about it.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.059
The second question we ask

00:04:42.083 --> 00:04:44.018
is, "What makes you happy

00:04:44.042 --> 00:04:47.018
or gives you the deepest
sense of fulfillment?"

00:04:47.042 --> 00:04:49.893
Now, you would assume that we all
know what makes us happy,

00:04:49.917 --> 00:04:53.268
but it's also interesting to note
that so many people have no idea

00:04:53.292 --> 00:04:54.667
what makes them happy,

00:04:56.208 --> 00:04:59.101
because they are so busy
going through the routines of life,

00:04:59.125 --> 00:05:01.292
they've never stopped to look inward.

00:05:02.458 --> 00:05:05.809
And so identifying the things
that give us a deep sense of fulfillment

00:05:05.833 --> 00:05:07.684
and the things that give us deep joy

00:05:07.708 --> 00:05:11.000
are thoughts that begin to direct us
in the direction of our passion.

00:05:11.833 --> 00:05:13.476
And just in case you're wondering

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.684
what your answers are
to those two questions,

00:05:15.708 --> 00:05:19.137
I invite you to sit with these questions
later and just reflect about it.

00:05:20.667 --> 00:05:22.268
However, I am also aware

00:05:22.292 --> 00:05:25.833
that passion alone
cannot guarantee success in life.

00:05:26.708 --> 00:05:27.976
And I should note

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.708
that not every passion
can become a career.

00:05:31.833 --> 00:05:34.059
For passion to become a career,

00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:38.958
it must be coupled with the right set
of skills, conditioning and positioning.

00:05:39.917 --> 00:05:42.434
So when we get our young people
to look inward,

00:05:42.458 --> 00:05:45.101
we also ask them what skills do you have,

00:05:45.125 --> 00:05:47.976
what talents do you have,
what experience do you have

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.417
that you can use to build
a niche in the marketplace.

00:05:52.208 --> 00:05:54.851
But more than that,
we also look at the market trends,

00:05:54.875 --> 00:05:57.559
because it doesn't matter
how much you love and enjoy it.

00:05:57.583 --> 00:06:00.684
If nobody wants it
or is willing to pay for it,

00:06:00.708 --> 00:06:02.434
it can't be a career.

00:06:02.458 --> 00:06:03.708
It's just a hobby.

00:06:05.625 --> 00:06:09.976
And the third thing we look at
is how do you position yourself?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.393
Who are you targeting?
Who do you want to sell to?

00:06:12.417 --> 00:06:14.809
Why would they want to buy from you?

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:18.101
And so the combination of the three
is what enables you to move

00:06:18.125 --> 00:06:20.833
from just a passion to a business.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.518
And many of our young people
have been able to turn their ideas

00:06:24.542 --> 00:06:27.393
and burning desires
into profitable businesses

00:06:27.417 --> 00:06:29.059
or social enterprises,

00:06:29.083 --> 00:06:31.101
and they're not just creating jobs,

00:06:31.125 --> 00:06:33.458
but they are solving societal challenges.

00:06:34.583 --> 00:06:36.768
I'll share with you two examples.

00:06:36.792 --> 00:06:38.684
One of them is Esther.

00:06:38.708 --> 00:06:40.684
I met Esther two years ago.

00:06:40.708 --> 00:06:42.667
She had been out of school for two years,

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.309
and she had been deeply affected
by her dropping out.

00:06:46.333 --> 00:06:49.143
As a result, she had experienced
severe depression

00:06:49.167 --> 00:06:52.417
to a point where she attempted
to take her own life several times.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.976
Her friends and family
didn't know what to do for her.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.375
They simply prayed for her.

00:06:58.583 --> 00:07:01.143
When I met Esther
and I started to converse with her,

00:07:01.167 --> 00:07:02.934
I asked her a simple question.

00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.768
I said, "If you had all the time
and the money in the world,

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:07.083
what would you do?"

00:07:07.917 --> 00:07:10.059
Without thinking or hesitation,

00:07:10.083 --> 00:07:12.059
her eyes lit up and she began to tell me

00:07:12.083 --> 00:07:14.559
how she wanted to change
the lives of young people.

00:07:14.583 --> 00:07:17.434
She wanted to restore
hope and dignity to other teenagers

00:07:17.458 --> 00:07:20.708
by helping them make
informed decisions about life.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.893
I was certain of the fact
that this burning desire in her

00:07:25.917 --> 00:07:27.476
was unquenchable.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.434
And so we worked with Esther
to put a framework around this desire.

00:07:31.458 --> 00:07:34.018
Today, she runs a social
enterprise in her village,

00:07:34.042 --> 00:07:39.476
raising awareness about substance abuse,
mental health, sexual reproductive health

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.726
and is helping other school dropouts
acquire vocational skills,

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.750
so they can make a living for themselves.

00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.667
Esther turned 20 this year,

00:07:49.542 --> 00:07:53.643
and for the last two years,
she has organized an annual teen fest

00:07:53.667 --> 00:07:57.167
that brings together over 500 teenagers.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:01.125
(Applause)

00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.726
Young people that are able
to network and collaborate

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.059
on different projects,

00:08:07.083 --> 00:08:11.000
but more importantly to meet professionals
they would otherwise never have met.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:16.059
This is all engineered by a girl that
believed the world had no room for her,

00:08:16.083 --> 00:08:19.768
that without education
she would never amount to anything.

00:08:19.792 --> 00:08:23.101
But by looking inward
and tapping into a burning desire,

00:08:23.125 --> 00:08:24.851
putting structure around it,

00:08:24.875 --> 00:08:28.143
it has become a model
that not only changed her life

00:08:28.167 --> 00:08:31.917
but is transforming the lives
of hundreds of young people every year.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.184
My other example is Musa.

00:08:35.208 --> 00:08:37.226
Musa is a natural artistic guy.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.708
He's the kind that would look
at any design and replicate it with ease.

00:08:41.417 --> 00:08:44.167
And so he seeks to recognize
that ability in him.

00:08:44.875 --> 00:08:47.559
When I met Musa,
he was doing all kinds of crafts --

00:08:47.583 --> 00:08:49.393
bags, belts, wallets --

00:08:49.417 --> 00:08:51.934
but it was more of a part-time thing.

00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:55.226
Or sometimes, if he was really broke
and needed to make quick money,

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.643
then he would come up
with a design and sell it.

00:08:57.667 --> 00:09:00.208
But he had never thought
of it as a business.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.559
We started working with Musa,

00:09:02.583 --> 00:09:06.393
helping him shift his mindset
from a hobby to a business

00:09:06.417 --> 00:09:10.143
and beginning to rethink how he can
make products that he could sell

00:09:10.167 --> 00:09:11.667
and even be able to scale.

00:09:12.625 --> 00:09:16.101
Musa makes some of
the most amazing bags I've ever seen,

00:09:16.125 --> 00:09:19.184
and over the last one year,
Musa's business has grown.

00:09:19.208 --> 00:09:21.351
He has been recognized
in different places.

00:09:21.375 --> 00:09:24.375
Currently, he's talking about
exporting to developed countries.

00:09:25.583 --> 00:09:27.184
Musa, like any other dropout,

00:09:27.208 --> 00:09:29.393
believed that without
academic credentials,

00:09:29.417 --> 00:09:31.851
he wouldn't amount to anything.

00:09:31.875 --> 00:09:34.226
He thought the talent he had was nothing

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:38.208
simply because he did not have
an academic paper to define him.

00:09:39.333 --> 00:09:43.518
But by looking inward and finding
that what he had was the greatest asset

00:09:43.542 --> 00:09:45.768
and supporting him
to turn it into a business,

00:09:45.792 --> 00:09:48.000
he's not just living -- he's thriving.

00:09:49.208 --> 00:09:53.476
The thing about looking inward
is that it can be scary,

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.226
especially if you're doing it
for the first time.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.351
But the truth is
you never truly start living

00:09:59.375 --> 00:10:02.333
until you learn to live
from the inside out.

00:10:03.583 --> 00:10:07.518
And in unlocking potential,
we need to look inward to identify

00:10:07.542 --> 00:10:10.309
the things that give us
a deep sense of fulfillment,

00:10:10.333 --> 00:10:12.601
the things that give us the deepest joy,

00:10:12.625 --> 00:10:16.351
and then weave them
into the patterns of our daily routines.

00:10:16.375 --> 00:10:20.250
In so doing, we cease to work
and we start to live.

00:10:21.167 --> 00:10:25.643
And the thing about living is that
you never have to retire or to resign.

00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:28.018
(Laughter)

00:10:28.042 --> 00:10:33.101
(Applause)

00:10:33.125 --> 00:10:36.059
And so as you think about
unlocking potential for ourselves,

00:10:36.083 --> 00:10:38.768
for our young people, for our children,

00:10:38.792 --> 00:10:41.268
let's not condition them to look outward

00:10:41.292 --> 00:10:43.309
but condition them to look inward

00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:48.684
to tap into who they are and bring
that self into what they do every day.

00:10:48.708 --> 00:10:51.434
When you cease to work and you live,

00:10:51.458 --> 00:10:53.309
when passion becomes a career,

00:10:53.333 --> 00:10:55.143
you don't just excel,

00:10:55.167 --> 00:10:57.042
you become unstoppable.

00:10:57.875 --> 00:10:59.143
Thank you.

00:10:59.167 --> 00:11:02.333
(Applause)
