00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.900
Each year in the United States,

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.519
players of sports 
and recreational activities

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.542
receive between 2.5 
and 4 million concussions.

00:00:16.542 --> 00:00:19.249
How dangerous are all those concussions?

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:20.860
The answer is complicated,

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.759
and lies in how the brain responds
when something strikes it.

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.829
The brain is made of soft fatty tissue,
with a consistency something like jello.

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.109
Inside its protective membranes
and the skull's hard casing,

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:38.450
this delicate organ 
is usually well-shielded.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.158
But a sudden jolt can make the brain shift

00:00:41.158 --> 00:00:44.829
and bump against 
the skull's hard interior,

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.931
and unlike jello, the brain's tissue
isn't uniform.

00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:52.940
It's made of a vast network
of 90 billion neurons,

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.720
which relay signals through their long
axons to communicate throughout the brain

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.011
and control our bodies.

00:01:00.011 --> 00:01:03.273
This spindly structure makes 
them very fragile

00:01:03.273 --> 00:01:08.631
so that when impacted, neurons
will stretch and even tear.

00:01:08.631 --> 00:01:11.271
That not only disrupts their ability
to communicate

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:14.792
but as destroyed axons begin
to degenerate,

00:01:14.792 --> 00:01:20.759
they also release toxins
causing the death of other neurons, too.

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.462
This combination of events causes
a concussion.

00:01:24.462 --> 00:01:26.952
The damage can manifest 
in many different ways

00:01:26.952 --> 00:01:28.382
including blackout,

00:01:28.382 --> 00:01:29.243
headache,

00:01:29.243 --> 00:01:30.373
blurry vision,

00:01:30.373 --> 00:01:31.674
balance problems,

00:01:31.674 --> 00:01:33.482
altered mood and behavior,

00:01:33.482 --> 00:01:36.055
problems with memory, 
thinking, and sleeping,

00:01:36.055 --> 00:01:40.383
and the onset of anxiety and depression.

00:01:40.383 --> 00:01:41.599
Every brain is different,

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:46.514
which explains why people's experiences
of concussions vary so widely.

00:01:46.514 --> 00:01:49.794
Luckily, the majority of concussions
fully heal

00:01:49.794 --> 00:01:54.578
and symptoms disappear
within a matter of days or weeks.

00:01:54.578 --> 00:01:57.553
Lots of rest and a gradual return
to activity

00:01:57.553 --> 00:02:00.824
allows the brain to heal itself.

00:02:00.824 --> 00:02:03.035
On the subject of rest,

00:02:03.035 --> 00:02:05.755
many people have heard that
you're not supposed to sleep

00:02:05.755 --> 00:02:11.164
shortly after receiving a concussion
because you might slip into a coma.

00:02:11.164 --> 00:02:12.824
That's a myth.

00:02:12.824 --> 00:02:17.194
So long as doctors aren't concerned there
may also be a more severe brain injury,

00:02:17.194 --> 00:02:18.804
like a brain bleed,

00:02:18.804 --> 00:02:23.334
there's no documented problem with
going to sleep after a concussion.

00:02:23.334 --> 00:02:26.386
Sometimes, victims of concussion can
experience something

00:02:26.386 --> 00:02:30.325
called post-concussion syndrome, or PCS.

00:02:30.325 --> 00:02:33.535
People with PCS may experience
constant headaches,

00:02:33.535 --> 00:02:35.087
learning difficulties,

00:02:35.087 --> 00:02:39.377
and behavioral symptoms that even
affect their personal relationships

00:02:39.377 --> 00:02:42.546
for months or years after the injury.

00:02:42.546 --> 00:02:46.416
Trying to play through a concussion,
even for only a few minutes,

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:49.968
or returning to sports too soon
after a concussion,

00:02:49.968 --> 00:02:53.636
makes it more likely to develop PCS.

00:02:53.636 --> 00:02:56.627
In some cases, a concussion 
can be hard to diagnose

00:02:56.627 --> 00:03:00.316
because the symptoms unfold slowly
over time.

00:03:00.316 --> 00:03:04.416
That's often true of 
subconcussive impacts

00:03:04.416 --> 00:03:06.907
which result from lower impact jolts
to the head

00:03:06.907 --> 00:03:09.538
than those that cause concussions.

00:03:09.538 --> 00:03:13.417
This category of injury doesn't cause
noticable symptoms right away,

00:03:13.417 --> 00:03:17.876
but can lead to severe degenerative
brain diseases over time

00:03:17.876 --> 00:03:20.327
if it happens repeatedly.

00:03:20.327 --> 00:03:25.207
Take soccer players, who are known
for repeatedly heading soccer balls.

00:03:25.207 --> 00:03:27.929
Using a technique called
Diffusion Tensor Imaging,

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:32.308
we're beginning to find out what effect
that has on the brain.

00:03:32.308 --> 00:03:35.948
This method allows scientists to find
large axon bundles

00:03:35.948 --> 00:03:40.689
and see how milder blows
might alter them structurally.

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.939
In 2013, researchers using 
this technique discovered

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:46.569
that athletes who had 
headed the ball most,

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.020
about 1,800 times a year,

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.099
had damaged the structural integrity
of their axon bundles.

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.829
The damage was similar to how
a rope will fail

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.670
when the individual fibers start to fray.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.009
Those players also performed worse
on short-term memory tests,

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:07.990
so even though no one suffered
full-blown concussions,

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:14.330
these subconcussive hits added up
to measurable damage over time.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.500
In fact, researchers know that an
overload of subconcussive hits

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.140
is linked to a degenerative brain disease
known as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy,

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.110
or CTE.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.152
People with CTE suffer from changes
in their mood and behavior

00:04:30.152 --> 00:04:33.031
that begin appearing in their 30s or 40s

00:04:33.031 --> 00:04:36.302
followed by problems with thinking
and memory

00:04:36.302 --> 00:04:41.109
that can, in some cases, even result
in dementia.

00:04:41.109 --> 00:04:43.590
The culprit is a protein called tau.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:50.301
Usually, tau proteins support tiny tubes
inside our axons called microtubules.

00:04:50.301 --> 00:04:54.732
It's thought that repeated subconcussive
hits damage the microtubules,

00:04:54.732 --> 00:04:59.431
causing the tau proteins to dislodge
and clump together.

00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:04.114
The clumps disrupt transport
and communication along the neuron

00:05:04.114 --> 00:05:08.862
and drive the breakdown of connections
within the brain.

00:05:08.862 --> 00:05:11.254
Once the tau proteins 
start clumping together,

00:05:11.254 --> 00:05:13.932
they cause more clumps to form

00:05:13.932 --> 00:05:16.413
and continue to spread 
throughout the brain,

00:05:16.413 --> 00:05:19.633
even after head impacts have stopped.

00:05:19.633 --> 00:05:22.288
The data show that at least
among football players,

00:05:22.288 --> 00:05:28.475
between 50 and 80% of concussions
go unreported and untreated.

00:05:28.475 --> 00:05:30.543
Sometimes that's because it's hard to tell

00:05:30.543 --> 00:05:32.864
a concussion has occurred 
in the first place.

00:05:32.864 --> 00:05:37.214
But it's also often due to pressure
or a desire to keep going

00:05:37.214 --> 00:05:40.136
despite the fact that something's wrong.

00:05:40.136 --> 00:05:42.185
This doesn't just undermine recovery.

00:05:42.185 --> 00:05:44.494
It's also dangerous.

00:05:44.494 --> 00:05:46.714
Our brains aren't invincible.

00:05:46.714 --> 00:05:49.414
They still need us to shield 
them from harm

00:05:49.414 --> 00:05:52.202
and help them undo damage
once it's been done.
