00:00:14.478 --> 00:00:16.635
Immortality.

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:21.264
In movies, kings are always searching
for the secret to immortality.

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:24.626
But is immortality really a good thing?

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.459
To a ten-year-old boy,
one year is the same as 10% of his life.

00:00:28.483 --> 00:00:32.692
To his forty-year-old mother,
one year is merely 2.5% of her life.

00:00:32.716 --> 00:00:34.655
The same year, 365 days,

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:38.005
can feel differently to different people.

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:39.864
If we live until we're 82,

00:00:39.888 --> 00:00:42.377
that's about 30,000 days.

00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:47.158
If this boy lives for 30,000 years,
a year to him could feel like a day.

00:00:47.182 --> 00:00:48.833
And if this boy's emotions sustain

00:00:48.857 --> 00:00:51.931
through the potential boredom
of living for millions of years,

00:00:51.955 --> 00:00:55.000
he might become extremely lonely and sad,

00:00:55.024 --> 00:01:00.302
knowing he has and always will
outlive everyone he has ever loved.

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:02.721
But what if everyone were immortal?

00:01:02.745 --> 00:01:05.185
Well, first off, Earth is only so big.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.572
So, where would we all live?

00:01:07.596 --> 00:01:08.846
(Grunts)

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.031
"Excuse me!"
"That's my face!"

00:01:11.055 --> 00:01:13.557
"Stop it!"
"Pardon me."

00:01:13.581 --> 00:01:14.606
"Tight in here!"

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.623
Do you remember what you did last year
or when you were five?

00:01:17.647 --> 00:01:19.602
How much of your past have you forgotten?

00:01:19.626 --> 00:01:22.701
If you have trouble remembering
what you did when you were five,

00:01:22.725 --> 00:01:26.251
how will you remember what happened
if you were alive a thousand years ago?

00:01:26.275 --> 00:01:27.305
A million years ago?

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.620
We don't remember every single
detail of our past

00:01:29.644 --> 00:01:31.644
because our brains have a limited capacity

00:01:31.668 --> 00:01:33.209
and we replace useless memories,

00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:35.091
like middle school locker combinations,

00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:37.184
with relevant information.

00:01:37.208 --> 00:01:39.344
If this immortal boy finds a companion

00:01:39.368 --> 00:01:41.599
to fall in love with
once every hundred years,

00:01:41.623 --> 00:01:45.344
he would have ten thousand girlfriends
in a million years.

00:01:45.368 --> 00:01:48.214
And how many of those
ten thousand girls' names

00:01:48.238 --> 00:01:49.893
will he be able to remember?

00:01:49.917 --> 00:01:53.270
This changes what a meaningful
relationship means, doesn't it?

00:01:53.294 --> 00:01:55.152
Another tricky thing about immortality:

00:01:55.176 --> 00:01:57.276
Human beings have not
always looked the same.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.872
This can be explained
by Darwin's theory of evolution.

00:01:59.896 --> 00:02:02.613
For instance, if women find
taller men more attractive,

00:02:02.637 --> 00:02:05.409
then more tall men would mate
and have children,

00:02:05.433 --> 00:02:07.481
putting more tall genes in the gene pool.

00:02:07.505 --> 00:02:09.186
That means, in the next generation,

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.428
more children will have
the genes to be taller.

00:02:11.452 --> 00:02:13.333
Repeat that process for a million years

00:02:13.357 --> 00:02:15.363
and the average height
will be a lot taller

00:02:15.387 --> 00:02:16.888
than the average height today,

00:02:16.912 --> 00:02:20.293
assuming there's no natural disaster
that wipes out all the tall people.

00:02:20.317 --> 00:02:22.433
Our ancestors were short, hairy apes.

00:02:22.457 --> 00:02:25.598
We still have body hair,
but we don't look like apes any more.

00:02:25.622 --> 00:02:27.622
If you're the only person who is immortal,

00:02:27.646 --> 00:02:29.446
while everyone else keeps evolving,

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.063
generation after generation,

00:02:31.087 --> 00:02:34.686
you will eventually look quite different
than the people who surround you.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.797
"Hi, how you doing?"

00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:38.503
If one of our ancestors, apes,
is still alive today,

00:02:38.527 --> 00:02:40.480
how many people will make friends with it

00:02:40.504 --> 00:02:43.099
instead of calling
the Museum of Natural History?

00:02:43.123 --> 00:02:46.373
And one more physical consideration
for immortality:

00:02:46.397 --> 00:02:47.712
Scars.

00:02:47.736 --> 00:02:51.589
After all, immortality doesn't
automatically translate to invincibility,

00:02:51.613 --> 00:02:53.788
it just means you cannot die.

00:02:53.812 --> 00:02:56.593
But it doesn't guarantee
what condition you'll be alive in.

00:02:56.617 --> 00:02:59.098
Look at your body
and count how many scars you have.

00:02:59.122 --> 00:03:01.159
If you have made this many permanent scars

00:03:01.183 --> 00:03:02.256
within your life,

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.646
imagine how much damage you would have
if you were one thousand years old!

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.018
Now, there are approximately

00:03:08.042 --> 00:03:11.356
185,000 amputation-related
hospital discharges

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.082
every year in the U.S.

00:03:13.106 --> 00:03:16.252
These injuries are due
to accidents or illnesses.

00:03:16.276 --> 00:03:19.345
Certainly the percentage is low
comparing to the total population

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:21.328
if you only live for a hundred years.

00:03:21.352 --> 00:03:24.914
However, if you've been alive
for over one million years,

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:28.167
the odds of still having
all your limbs are pretty slim.

00:03:28.191 --> 00:03:29.682
What about little accessories,

00:03:29.706 --> 00:03:31.500
like your eyes, your nose, your ears,

00:03:31.524 --> 00:03:33.003
fingers or toes?

00:03:33.027 --> 00:03:34.997
What about your teeth?

00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:37.450
What are the odds of you
keeping your dental health

00:03:37.474 --> 00:03:38.503
for a hundred years?

00:03:38.527 --> 00:03:39.995
A thousand years?

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.346
One million years?

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.525
You might end up looking like
a horribly scuffed-up Mr. Potato Head

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.851
with missing pieces and dentures.

00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:51.152
So, are you sure you want to live forever?

00:03:52.041 --> 00:03:56.652
Now, which superpower physics lesson
will you explore next?

00:03:56.676 --> 00:04:01.059
Shifting body size and content,

00:04:01.083 --> 00:04:02.211
super speed,

00:04:02.235 --> 00:04:04.108
flight,

00:04:04.132 --> 00:04:06.858
super strength,

00:04:06.882 --> 00:04:09.374
immortality,

00:04:09.398 --> 00:04:11.326
and --

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.485
invisibility.
