00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:16.321
Two years ago, I set off
from central London on the Tube

00:00:16.345 --> 00:00:18.643
and ended up somewhere
in the east of the city

00:00:18.667 --> 00:00:20.580
walking into a self-storage unit

00:00:20.604 --> 00:00:24.199
to meet a guy that had
2,000 luxury polo shirts for sale.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.105
And as I made my way down the corridor,

00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:30.122
a broken, blinking light made it
just like the cliche scene

00:00:30.146 --> 00:00:31.343
from a gangster movie.

00:00:32.462 --> 00:00:34.644
Our man was early,
and he was waiting for me

00:00:34.668 --> 00:00:37.525
in front of a unit secured
with four padlocks down the side.

00:00:38.043 --> 00:00:39.580
On our opening exchange,

00:00:39.604 --> 00:00:41.343
it was like a verbal sparring match

00:00:41.367 --> 00:00:43.001
where he threw the first punches.

00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:45.915
Who was I?
Did I have a business card?

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:47.862
And where was I going to sell?

00:00:47.886 --> 00:00:50.566
And then, he just started opening up,

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.740
and it was my turn.

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:54.379
Where were the polo shirts coming from?

00:00:54.403 --> 00:00:55.754
What paperwork did he have?

00:00:56.501 --> 00:00:59.032
And when was his next shipment
going to arrive?

00:00:59.056 --> 00:01:00.390
I was treading the fine line

00:01:00.414 --> 00:01:03.169
between asking enough questions
to get what I needed

00:01:03.193 --> 00:01:05.740
and not enough for him
to become suspicious,

00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:10.294
because what he didn't know
is that I'm a counterfeit investigator,

00:01:10.318 --> 00:01:11.681
(Laughter)

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:14.468
and after 20 minutes or so
of checking over the product

00:01:14.492 --> 00:01:18.007
for the telltale signs
of counterfeit production --

00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:20.357
say, badly stitched labels
or how the packaging

00:01:20.381 --> 00:01:23.206
had a huge brand logo
stamped all over the front of it --

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.126
I was finally on my way out,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.221
but not before he insisted
on walking down to the street with me

00:01:28.245 --> 00:01:29.451
and back to the station.

00:01:31.237 --> 00:01:33.905
And the feeling after these meetings
is always the same:

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.009
my heart is beating like a drum,

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:38.928
because you never know
if they've actually bought your story,

00:01:38.952 --> 00:01:42.080
or they're going to start following you
to see who you really are.

00:01:42.104 --> 00:01:44.454
Relief only comes
when you turn the first corner

00:01:44.478 --> 00:01:46.842
and glance behind,
and they're not standing there.

00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:51.352
But what our counterfeit
polo shirt seller certainly didn't realize

00:01:51.376 --> 00:01:55.137
is that everything I'd seen and heard
would result in a dawn raid on his house,

00:01:55.161 --> 00:01:57.948
him being woken out of bed
by eight men on his doorstep

00:01:57.972 --> 00:01:59.362
and all his product seized.

00:02:00.557 --> 00:02:04.040
But this would reveal
that he was just a pawn

00:02:04.064 --> 00:02:07.522
at the end of a counterfeiting network
spanning three continents,

00:02:07.546 --> 00:02:10.664
and he was just the first loose thread
that I'd started to pull on

00:02:10.688 --> 00:02:12.625
in the hope that it would all unravel.

00:02:13.697 --> 00:02:15.434
Why go through all that trouble?

00:02:16.358 --> 00:02:18.799
Well, maybe counterfeiting
is a victimless crime?

00:02:19.365 --> 00:02:21.475
These big companies,
they make enough money,

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:22.770
so if anything,

00:02:22.794 --> 00:02:25.530
counterfeiting is just a free form
of advertising, right?

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.546
And consumers believe just that --

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.467
that the buying and selling of fakes
is not that big a deal.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.149
But I'm here to tell you
that that is just not true.

00:02:36.848 --> 00:02:40.777
What the tourist on holiday doesn't see
about those fake handbags

00:02:40.801 --> 00:02:43.237
is they may well
have been stitched together

00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:46.750
by a child who was trafficked
away from her family,

00:02:46.774 --> 00:02:49.246
and what the car repair shop
owner doesn't realize

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.403
about those fake brake pads

00:02:51.427 --> 00:02:54.769
is they may well be lining the pockets
of an organized crime gang

00:02:54.793 --> 00:02:56.895
involved in drugs and prostitution.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.840
And while those two things
are horrible to think about,

00:03:00.864 --> 00:03:03.172
it gets much worse,

00:03:03.196 --> 00:03:06.068
because counterfeiting
is even funding terrorism.

00:03:07.043 --> 00:03:08.511
Let that sink in for a moment.

00:03:09.567 --> 00:03:12.396
Terrorists are selling fakes
to fund attacks,

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.109
attacks in our cities
that try to make victims of all of us.

00:03:17.442 --> 00:03:19.681
You wouldn't buy a live scorpion,

00:03:19.705 --> 00:03:22.753
because there's a chance
that it would sting you on the way home,

00:03:22.777 --> 00:03:24.760
but would you still buy a fake handbag

00:03:24.784 --> 00:03:28.283
if you knew the profits
would enable someone to buy bullets

00:03:28.307 --> 00:03:31.672
that would kill you and other
innocent people six months later?

00:03:32.594 --> 00:03:33.744
Maybe not.

00:03:34.552 --> 00:03:36.314
OK, time to come clean.

00:03:36.668 --> 00:03:37.819
In my youth --

00:03:37.843 --> 00:03:40.696
yeah, I might look like I'm still
clinging on to it a bit --

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.888
I bought fake watches
while on holiday in the Canary Islands.

00:03:44.395 --> 00:03:45.767
But why do I tell you this?

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:48.681
Well, we've all done it,

00:03:48.705 --> 00:03:50.380
or we know someone that's done it.

00:03:50.404 --> 00:03:54.047
And until this very moment,
maybe you didn't think twice about it,

00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:55.447
and nor did I,

00:03:55.471 --> 00:03:58.098
until I answered a 20-word cryptic advert

00:03:58.122 --> 00:04:00.407
to become an intellectual
property investigator.

00:04:02.086 --> 00:04:05.128
It said "Full training given
and some international travel."

00:04:05.152 --> 00:04:08.901
Within a week, I was creating
my first of many aliases,

00:04:08.925 --> 00:04:12.003
and in the 10 years since,
I've investigated fake car parts,

00:04:12.027 --> 00:04:15.241
alloy wheels, fake pet grooming tools,

00:04:15.265 --> 00:04:16.956
fake bicycle parts,

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.107
and, of course,
the counterfeiter's favorite,

00:04:19.131 --> 00:04:22.241
fake luxury leather goods,
clothing and shoes.

00:04:23.027 --> 00:04:25.901
And what I've learned in the 10 years
of investigating fakes

00:04:25.925 --> 00:04:28.366
is that once you start
to scratch the surface,

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.552
you find that they are rotten to the core,

00:04:30.576 --> 00:04:35.314
as are the people and organizations
that are making money from them,

00:04:35.338 --> 00:04:38.805
because they are profiting
on a massive, massive scale.

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:41.928
You can only make
around a hundred to 200 percent

00:04:41.952 --> 00:04:43.466
selling drugs on the street.

00:04:43.807 --> 00:04:47.650
You can make 2,000 percent
selling fakes online

00:04:47.674 --> 00:04:49.895
with little of the same
risks or penalties.

00:04:50.856 --> 00:04:52.141
And this quick, easy money

00:04:52.165 --> 00:04:54.809
then goes on to fund
the more serious types of crime,

00:04:54.833 --> 00:04:57.397
and it pays the way
to making these organizations,

00:04:57.421 --> 00:04:59.832
these criminal organizations,
look more legitimate.

00:05:00.863 --> 00:05:02.894
So let me bring you in on a live case.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.819
Earlier this year,
a series of raids took place

00:05:05.843 --> 00:05:08.164
in one of my longest-running
investigations.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.523
Five warehouses were raided in Turkey,

00:05:11.547 --> 00:05:15.360
and over two million finished
counterfeit clothing products were seized,

00:05:15.384 --> 00:05:18.375
and it took 16 trucks
to take that all away.

00:05:19.288 --> 00:05:20.718
But this gang had been clever.

00:05:20.742 --> 00:05:24.130
They had gone to the lengths
of creating their own fashion brands,

00:05:24.154 --> 00:05:26.137
complete with registered trademarks,

00:05:26.161 --> 00:05:28.662
and even having photo shoots
on yachts in Italy.

00:05:31.124 --> 00:05:34.782
And they would use these completely
unheard-of and unsuspicious brand names

00:05:34.806 --> 00:05:37.448
as a way of shipping
container loads of fakes

00:05:37.472 --> 00:05:39.948
to shell companies
that they'd set up across Europe.

00:05:40.974 --> 00:05:42.846
And documents found during those raids

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.244
found that they'd been falsifying
shipping documents

00:05:46.268 --> 00:05:49.014
so the customs officials
would literally have no idea

00:05:49.038 --> 00:05:51.228
who had sent the products
in the first place.

00:05:51.944 --> 00:05:54.301
When police got access
to just one bank account,

00:05:54.325 --> 00:05:56.139
they found nearly three million euros

00:05:56.163 --> 00:05:59.608
had been laundered out of Spain
in less than two years,

00:05:59.632 --> 00:06:01.711
and just two days after those raids,

00:06:01.735 --> 00:06:05.200
that gang were trying to bribe a law firm
to get their stock back.

00:06:06.782 --> 00:06:09.846
Even now, we have no idea
where all that money went,

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.036
to who it went to,

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.353
but you can bet it's never going
to benefit the likes of you or me.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.272
But these aren't just
low-level street thugs.

00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:21.876
They're business professionals,
and they fly first class.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.806
They trick legitimate businesses

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.790
with convincing fake invoices
and paperwork,

00:06:26.814 --> 00:06:28.440
so everything just seems real,

00:06:28.464 --> 00:06:31.060
and then they set up eBay
and Amazon accounts

00:06:31.084 --> 00:06:34.027
just to compete with the people
they've already sold fakes to.

00:06:35.813 --> 00:06:37.622
But this isn't just happening online.

00:06:38.117 --> 00:06:42.594
For a few years, I also used to attend
automotive trade shows

00:06:42.618 --> 00:06:45.301
taking place in huge exhibition spaces,

00:06:45.325 --> 00:06:48.517
but away from the Ferraris
and the Bentleys and the flashing lights,

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:50.475
there'd be companies selling fakes:

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:53.190
companies with a brochure on the counter

00:06:53.214 --> 00:06:56.516
and another one underneath,
if you ask them the right questions.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.351
And they would sell me fake car parts,
faulty fake car parts

00:06:59.375 --> 00:07:03.892
that have been estimated to cause
over 36,000 fatalities,

00:07:03.916 --> 00:07:05.787
deaths on our roads each year.

00:07:07.182 --> 00:07:13.071
Counterfeiting is set to become
a 2.3-trillion-dollar underground economy,

00:07:13.095 --> 00:07:16.150
and the damage that can be done
with that kind of money,

00:07:16.174 --> 00:07:17.460
it's really frightening ...

00:07:18.587 --> 00:07:21.905
because fakes fund terror.

00:07:21.929 --> 00:07:24.350
Fake trainers on the streets of Paris,

00:07:24.374 --> 00:07:26.817
fake cigarettes in West Africa,

00:07:26.841 --> 00:07:29.056
and pirate music CDs in the USA

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.334
have all gone on to fund
trips to training camps,

00:07:32.358 --> 00:07:35.484
bought weapons and ammunition,
or the ingredients for explosives.

00:07:36.421 --> 00:07:39.620
In June 2014, the French security services

00:07:39.644 --> 00:07:45.620
stopped monitoring the communications
of Said and Cherif Kouachi,

00:07:45.644 --> 00:07:49.524
the two brothers who had been
on a terror watch list for three years.

00:07:49.548 --> 00:07:52.772
But that summer, they were only
picking up that Cherif was buying

00:07:52.796 --> 00:07:54.855
fake trainers from China,

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:57.514
so it signaled a shift away from extremism

00:07:57.538 --> 00:08:00.442
into what was considered
a low-level petty crime.

00:08:01.752 --> 00:08:03.045
The threat had gone away.

00:08:04.049 --> 00:08:05.207
Seven months later,

00:08:05.231 --> 00:08:08.389
the two brothers walked into the offices
of Charlie Hebdo magazine

00:08:08.413 --> 00:08:11.218
and killed 12 people, wounded 11 more,

00:08:11.242 --> 00:08:13.908
with guns from the proceeds
of those fakes.

00:08:14.603 --> 00:08:18.235
So whatever you think, this isn't
a faraway problem happening in China.

00:08:18.259 --> 00:08:19.551
It's happening right here.

00:08:21.528 --> 00:08:22.885
And Paris is not unique.

00:08:23.642 --> 00:08:27.754
Ten years earlier, in 2004,
191 people lost their lives

00:08:27.778 --> 00:08:29.721
when a Madrid commuter train was bombed.

00:08:30.307 --> 00:08:34.561
The attack had been partly funded
by the sale of pirate music CDs in the US.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.722
Two years prior to that,
an Al Qaeda training manual

00:08:37.746 --> 00:08:40.316
recommended explicitly selling fakes

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.991
as a good way of supporting terror cells.

00:08:44.574 --> 00:08:49.709
But despite this, despite the evidence
connecting terrorism and counterfeiting,

00:08:49.733 --> 00:08:52.503
we do go on buying them,
increasing the demand

00:08:52.527 --> 00:08:54.876
to the point where
there's even a store in Turkey

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.664
called "I Love Genuine Fakes."

00:08:58.688 --> 00:09:01.887
And you have tourists posing
with photographs on TripAdvisor,

00:09:01.911 --> 00:09:03.648
giving it five-star reviews.

00:09:04.301 --> 00:09:06.736
But would those same tourists
have gone into a store

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.072
called "I Love Genuine Fake Viagra Pills"

00:09:10.096 --> 00:09:12.500
or "I Genuinely Love Funding Terrorism"?

00:09:13.282 --> 00:09:14.432
I doubt it.

00:09:15.564 --> 00:09:18.510
Many of us think
that we're completely helpless

00:09:18.534 --> 00:09:20.620
against organized crime and terrorism,

00:09:20.644 --> 00:09:23.550
that we can do nothing
about the next attack,

00:09:23.574 --> 00:09:24.986
but I believe you can.

00:09:25.755 --> 00:09:28.359
You can by becoming investigators, too.

00:09:29.875 --> 00:09:32.756
The way we cripple these networks
is to cut their funding,

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.392
and that means cutting the demand

00:09:34.416 --> 00:09:37.173
and changing this idea
that it's a victimless crime.

00:09:37.197 --> 00:09:39.658
Let's all identify counterfeiters,

00:09:39.682 --> 00:09:41.181
and don't give them our money.

00:09:41.736 --> 00:09:44.396
So here's a few tips
from one investigator to another

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.704
to get you started.

00:09:46.633 --> 00:09:47.910
Number one:

00:09:47.934 --> 00:09:50.609
here's a typical
online counterfeiter's website.

00:09:51.263 --> 00:09:52.413
Note the URL.

00:09:52.923 --> 00:09:55.884
If you're shopping for sunglasses
or camera lenses, say,

00:09:55.908 --> 00:09:59.414
and you come across a website
like medical-insurance-bankruptcy.com,

00:09:59.438 --> 00:10:01.003
start to get very suspicious.

00:10:01.027 --> 00:10:02.553
(Laughter)

00:10:02.577 --> 00:10:04.849
Counterfeiters register
expired domain names

00:10:04.873 --> 00:10:08.149
as a way of keeping up
the old website's Google page ranking.

00:10:09.401 --> 00:10:10.552
Number two:

00:10:10.576 --> 00:10:14.059
is the website screaming at you
that everything is 100 percent genuine,

00:10:14.083 --> 00:10:17.290
but still giving you 75 percent
off the latest collection?

00:10:18.003 --> 00:10:20.431
Look for words like "master copy,"

00:10:20.455 --> 00:10:22.455
"overruns," "straight from the factory."

00:10:23.201 --> 00:10:26.321
They could write this all in Comic Sans,
it's that much of a joke.

00:10:26.345 --> 00:10:27.954
(Laughter)

00:10:27.978 --> 00:10:29.212
Number three:

00:10:29.236 --> 00:10:31.112
if you get as far as the checkout page,

00:10:31.136 --> 00:10:36.399
and you don't see "https"
or a padlock symbol next to the URL,

00:10:36.423 --> 00:10:39.035
you should really start thinking
about closing the tab,

00:10:39.059 --> 00:10:41.337
because these indicate
active security measures

00:10:41.361 --> 00:10:44.466
that will keep your personal
and credit card information safe.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:46.583
OK, last one:

00:10:46.607 --> 00:10:48.811
go hunting for the "Contact Us" page.

00:10:48.835 --> 00:10:51.664
If you can only find a generic webform,

00:10:51.688 --> 00:10:55.613
no company name, telephone number,
email address, postal address --

00:10:55.637 --> 00:10:57.697
that's it, case closed.

00:10:57.721 --> 00:10:59.968
You found a counterfeiter.

00:10:59.992 --> 00:11:02.263
Sadly, you're going to have
to go back to Google

00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:04.431
and start your shopping search
all over again,

00:11:04.455 --> 00:11:07.365
but you didn't get ripped off,
so that's only a good thing.

00:11:08.601 --> 00:11:12.173
As the world's most famous
fictional detective would say,

00:11:12.197 --> 00:11:14.275
"Watson, the game is afoot."

00:11:15.027 --> 00:11:17.558
Only this time, my investigator friends,

00:11:17.582 --> 00:11:19.162
the game is painfully real.

00:11:19.973 --> 00:11:22.075
So the next time you're shopping online,

00:11:22.099 --> 00:11:23.996
or perhaps wherever it is,

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:28.212
look closer, question a little bit
deeper, and ask yourself --

00:11:28.236 --> 00:11:31.147
before you hand over
the cash or click "Buy,"

00:11:31.171 --> 00:11:32.449
"Am I sure this is real?"

00:11:33.208 --> 00:11:36.658
Tell your friend that used to buy
counterfeit watches

00:11:36.682 --> 00:11:39.656
that he may just have brought
the next attack one day closer.

00:11:40.335 --> 00:11:42.810
And, if you see
an Instagram advert for fakes,

00:11:42.834 --> 00:11:44.224
don't keep scrolling past,

00:11:44.248 --> 00:11:46.461
report it to the platform as a scam.

00:11:47.375 --> 00:11:50.437
Let's shine a light
on the dark forces of counterfeiting

00:11:50.461 --> 00:11:51.946
that are hiding in plain sight.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.525
So please, spread the word

00:11:54.549 --> 00:11:55.970
and don't stop investigating.

00:11:56.385 --> 00:11:57.536
Thank you.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:01.730
(Applause)
