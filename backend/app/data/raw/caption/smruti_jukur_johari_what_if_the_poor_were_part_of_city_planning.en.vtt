00:00:13.032 --> 00:00:15.642
What is our imagery of cities?

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.825
When we imagine cities,

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:20.825
we often imagine it
to be something like this.

00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:25.778
But what if what you're looking at
is just half a picture,

00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:28.428
but there is a city within the city.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.834
This part of the city
is often seen as slums,

00:00:32.858 --> 00:00:34.879
squatters, informal,

00:00:34.903 --> 00:00:38.093
and people living here
are called illegal, informal,

00:00:38.117 --> 00:00:41.204
criminals, beneficiaries,
supplicants, etc.

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.575
But in reality,

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:46.662
these are poor people with no choices.

00:00:47.702 --> 00:00:49.766
Poverty is a vicious cycle.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.758
If born poor, it can take
three or more generations

00:00:52.782 --> 00:00:53.932
to escape one.

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:57.547
Many are forced in this cycle
without choices,

00:00:57.571 --> 00:01:00.490
to live on pavements,

00:01:00.514 --> 00:01:02.545
along train tracks,

00:01:03.765 --> 00:01:05.550
in dumping grounds,

00:01:06.463 --> 00:01:08.662
along rivers,

00:01:08.686 --> 00:01:11.749
swamps and many such unlivable spaces,

00:01:11.773 --> 00:01:14.701
without clean water, toilets or housing.

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:18.405
But these places are not unfamiliar to me,

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:22.730
because since the age of six,
I accompanied my father, a doctor,

00:01:22.754 --> 00:01:25.728
who treated patients
in the slums of Bombay.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:28.736
Growing up, I would help him
carry his bag of medicines

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.934
after school lessons --

00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.225
I loved doing that.

00:01:31.744 --> 00:01:34.276
Wanting to do something
about these habitats,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.997
I decided to become an architect.

00:01:37.577 --> 00:01:39.863
But quite early on, I realized

00:01:39.887 --> 00:01:43.043
that the beauty of architecture
was only for the rich.

00:01:43.782 --> 00:01:47.195
So I decided to do urban planning

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:50.623
and joined an NGO in India
that works with the urban poor

00:01:50.647 --> 00:01:53.633
who organize themselves
to access basic services,

00:01:53.657 --> 00:01:57.331
such as water, sanitation and housing,
for the poor living in cities.

00:01:58.228 --> 00:02:03.927
Now I spent 10 years of my life
in professional education, in learning,

00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:06.418
and then five years in unlearning it.

00:02:06.815 --> 00:02:09.061
Because I realized

00:02:09.085 --> 00:02:12.434
that all my training in architecture,
design and planning

00:02:12.458 --> 00:02:14.553
failed ground realities.

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.497
And this is where I learned
the power of choice.

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.044
I unlearned many things,

00:02:22.068 --> 00:02:23.908
but there are two myths about the poor

00:02:23.932 --> 00:02:26.625
that I would like to share
that we live with.

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:29.643
The first myth is a perception

00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:33.095
that migration of poor people
into cities is a problem.

00:02:34.572 --> 00:02:36.904
Is migration really a choice?

00:02:37.831 --> 00:02:39.863
My mentor Sheela Patel

00:02:39.887 --> 00:02:43.410
asked to those who think
of this as a problem,

00:02:43.434 --> 00:02:46.830
"Go ask your grandfather
where he came from," she says.

00:02:49.798 --> 00:02:52.933
So what do poor people do
when they migrate in cities?

00:02:52.957 --> 00:02:54.557
Let me share an example.

00:02:55.188 --> 00:02:57.609
This is the Mumbai International Airport.

00:02:57.633 --> 00:03:01.355
All that you see in blue
are large informal settlements around it.

00:03:01.862 --> 00:03:04.754
Close to 75,000 people live here.

00:03:05.445 --> 00:03:10.751
So who are these people
that work silently in hotels, restaurants,

00:03:10.775 --> 00:03:14.077
as laborers, babysitters, house helps

00:03:14.101 --> 00:03:15.752
and countless other jobs

00:03:15.776 --> 00:03:18.522
that we need for cities to function
without a glitch?

00:03:19.133 --> 00:03:20.666
And where do they live?

00:03:21.165 --> 00:03:24.037
In most cities, they live in slums.

00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:26.728
So let us think again.

00:03:27.204 --> 00:03:30.137
Do we want poor people
to stop migrating in our cities?

00:03:31.278 --> 00:03:34.039
What if they had a choice of not to?

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.793
The second myth is my personal experience.

00:03:40.188 --> 00:03:43.922
It's this attitude that we
professionals know better.

00:03:44.688 --> 00:03:47.634
We professionals love
to make choices for others,

00:03:47.658 --> 00:03:49.523
especially for the poor.

00:03:49.547 --> 00:03:51.347
Let me share an experience.

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.650
In a workshop that looked at designing
250 new houses for poor families

00:03:56.674 --> 00:03:58.579
from a slum nearby,

00:03:58.603 --> 00:04:02.090
there were different building materials
that were presented,

00:04:02.114 --> 00:04:05.662
ranging from papier-mâché,
cardboard, honeycomb, etc.,

00:04:05.686 --> 00:04:07.649
simply because they were affordable.

00:04:08.646 --> 00:04:12.217
But there was this one idea
that was of shipping containers.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.029
Now we immediately approved of it,

00:04:15.053 --> 00:04:18.735
because we thought it was sustainable,
scalable, affordable.

00:04:19.553 --> 00:04:21.434
But during this presentation,

00:04:21.458 --> 00:04:23.924
a lady from the slum humbly spoke up.

00:04:24.545 --> 00:04:27.046
And she asked the presenter,

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.012
"Would you choose to live in it?"

00:04:29.458 --> 00:04:30.878
(Laughter)

00:04:31.514 --> 00:04:34.505
"If not, then why did you think we would?"

00:04:35.704 --> 00:04:38.577
Now this was a personal
unlearning moment for me,

00:04:38.601 --> 00:04:42.069
where I realized that poverty
only changes affordability --

00:04:42.093 --> 00:04:44.160
it does not change aspirations.

00:04:45.268 --> 00:04:49.283
Now poor people have lived
in temporary structures all their life.

00:04:49.307 --> 00:04:50.839
They go from wall to wall,

00:04:50.863 --> 00:04:52.772
moving from bricks to tin.

00:04:53.307 --> 00:04:55.450
They move from building from bamboo,

00:04:55.474 --> 00:04:58.474
tarpaulin sheets, plastic,
to cardboard, to tin,

00:04:58.498 --> 00:04:59.649
to bricks and cement,

00:04:59.673 --> 00:05:01.273
just like the way we do.

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:05.633
So somewhere here, we were forcing
our choices on them.

00:05:05.657 --> 00:05:08.125
So should we force our choices on them,

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:10.656
or should we broaden their choices?

00:05:11.752 --> 00:05:15.219
Now what if the opportunity to choose
was given to people?

00:05:15.998 --> 00:05:20.512
These are women who lived on the pavements
of a neighborhood in Mumbai.

00:05:21.037 --> 00:05:24.849
Now they faced constant evictions,
and in response to it,

00:05:24.873 --> 00:05:28.339
they organized a women's network
called Mahila Milan.

00:05:29.055 --> 00:05:32.839
Not only did they fight against evictions
with those in power,

00:05:32.863 --> 00:05:35.141
saved money and bought land,

00:05:35.165 --> 00:05:38.696
but they also designed
and helped construct their own houses.

00:05:39.538 --> 00:05:42.837
Well, these were illiterate women,
so how did they do that?

00:05:44.593 --> 00:05:48.923
They used floor mats and saris
to understand measurements.

00:05:49.423 --> 00:05:53.549
A sari is four meters in length
and 1.5 meters in width.

00:05:54.098 --> 00:05:58.700
They used these simple day-to-day items
to demonstrate house models.

00:05:59.115 --> 00:06:01.965
And even they made
three options to choose from

00:06:01.989 --> 00:06:05.040
and invited all their fellow residents
to come and have a look.

00:06:05.064 --> 00:06:06.750
(Laughter)

00:06:06.774 --> 00:06:11.135
And everybody loved this option
that had a loft in it,

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:13.119
simply because it did two things.

00:06:13.143 --> 00:06:16.683
One is that it accommodated
larger families to sleep in.

00:06:16.707 --> 00:06:19.720
And two, it allowed home-based work,

00:06:19.744 --> 00:06:22.108
such as bangle-making, jewelry-designing,

00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:24.973
embroidery-stitching,
packaging items, etc.

00:06:26.212 --> 00:06:29.745
Now they also decided
to not have a toilet inside,

00:06:29.769 --> 00:06:32.698
but instead have it outside
in the corridors,

00:06:32.722 --> 00:06:35.602
simply because it gave them
more space and it was cheaper.

00:06:37.095 --> 00:06:39.540
Now, professionals
could have never thought

00:06:39.564 --> 00:06:40.885
of something like that.

00:06:41.798 --> 00:06:45.663
A formal design would have necessitated
to have a toilet inside.

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:49.688
Now these are smaller examples --

00:06:49.712 --> 00:06:52.077
let me share some larger context:

00:06:53.228 --> 00:06:55.475
881,000,000 people --

00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:58.593
that's about one sixth of this world,
as we talk here --

00:06:58.617 --> 00:07:01.051
are living in slums
and informal settlements.

00:07:01.482 --> 00:07:07.130
Almost every city in the global south
has large slums in the size of townships.

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:10.416
Kibera, in Nairobi,

00:07:11.313 --> 00:07:13.211
Dharavi, in Mumbai,

00:07:15.046 --> 00:07:17.664
Khayelitsha in South Africa, just a few.

00:07:18.903 --> 00:07:22.473
Now initially, they were all
on waste and abandoned lands

00:07:22.497 --> 00:07:24.412
that cities were never interested in.

00:07:24.857 --> 00:07:26.110
As cities grew,

00:07:26.134 --> 00:07:28.460
poor people started building
on these lands

00:07:28.484 --> 00:07:30.817
and brought value to this over time.

00:07:32.038 --> 00:07:35.393
And today, these lands have become
real estate hot spots

00:07:35.417 --> 00:07:37.550
that everybody wants a piece of.

00:07:38.331 --> 00:07:41.713
So how do cities and those in power
choose to deal with them?

00:07:43.442 --> 00:07:45.678
They demolish them and evict them

00:07:45.702 --> 00:07:49.448
and move them away
from their cities and economies

00:07:49.472 --> 00:07:51.995
in order to build a new infrastructure.

00:07:53.456 --> 00:07:56.099
They move them into vertical housing,

00:07:57.234 --> 00:07:59.879
which in reality looks like this.

00:08:00.982 --> 00:08:02.782
Now when built in high densities,

00:08:02.806 --> 00:08:04.744
they lack natural light and ventilation,

00:08:04.768 --> 00:08:07.206
and it often leads
to unhealthy conditions.

00:08:08.815 --> 00:08:10.702
Now, on one hand,

00:08:10.726 --> 00:08:14.218
poor people are not involved
in the participation of design,

00:08:14.242 --> 00:08:16.649
and there is poor quality of construction.

00:08:16.673 --> 00:08:19.139
And on the other hand,

00:08:19.163 --> 00:08:21.465
they do not understand
how to do maintenance,

00:08:21.489 --> 00:08:25.323
you know, keeping bills,
keeping records, forming societies --

00:08:25.347 --> 00:08:27.050
this is always difficult for them.

00:08:28.564 --> 00:08:33.056
And being forced to move
into this formal society,

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.833
they end up looking like this
in a few years.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.913
Because formalization is not a product,

00:08:38.937 --> 00:08:40.088
it's a process.

00:08:40.112 --> 00:08:43.569
Moving from informal to formal
for poor people is a journey.

00:08:43.903 --> 00:08:46.450
It takes time to accept and adapt.

00:08:48.187 --> 00:08:50.569
And when that choice is not given,

00:08:50.593 --> 00:08:51.821
it becomes like this,

00:08:51.845 --> 00:08:55.450
which I'm afraid, in future,
these would become the slums.

00:08:57.799 --> 00:08:59.077
Now instead of doing this,

00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:01.482
what if we accommodated poor people

00:09:01.506 --> 00:09:04.053
and gave them a choice
to be a part of our cities

00:09:04.077 --> 00:09:06.180
and develop them where they are,

00:09:06.204 --> 00:09:08.894
giving them basic services,
like in this picture?

00:09:10.553 --> 00:09:14.093
Now what happens if cities
and governments could work together,

00:09:14.117 --> 00:09:16.950
if governments acknowledge poor people,

00:09:16.974 --> 00:09:18.894
and they could build it together?

00:09:19.458 --> 00:09:21.061
This is Mukuru.

00:09:21.609 --> 00:09:24.433
It's a large informal
settlement in Nairobi.

00:09:24.457 --> 00:09:26.781
It's one of the largest
settlements in Africa.

00:09:27.244 --> 00:09:29.410
It's home to 300,000 people

00:09:29.434 --> 00:09:32.069
living over 650 acres of land.

00:09:33.007 --> 00:09:34.624
To help us understand that scale,

00:09:34.648 --> 00:09:37.464
it's like squeezing
the population of Pittsburgh

00:09:37.488 --> 00:09:39.421
into the New York Central Park.

00:09:40.396 --> 00:09:41.546
That's Mukuru.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.982
So to give us a glimpse,

00:09:45.006 --> 00:09:47.206
this is the condition of housing.

00:09:48.776 --> 00:09:50.978
And this is what it is in between them.

00:09:53.105 --> 00:09:56.465
So what is life in Mukuru like,
just talking briefly?

00:09:57.065 --> 00:10:01.339
Five hundred and fifty people
use one single water tap

00:10:01.363 --> 00:10:02.857
and pay nine times more

00:10:02.881 --> 00:10:05.569
than what anybody else
in the city could pay,

00:10:05.593 --> 00:10:07.831
simply because there is
no water infrastructure

00:10:07.855 --> 00:10:09.055
and water is sold.

00:10:10.546 --> 00:10:14.720
Many come back from work to find out
that their houses do not exist,

00:10:14.744 --> 00:10:16.926
because they have either been bulldozed,

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.479
or they have been burned down.

00:10:20.695 --> 00:10:22.758
So, tired of this situation,

00:10:22.782 --> 00:10:25.659
a local slum dwellers' federation
called Muungano

00:10:25.683 --> 00:10:27.647
decided to do something about it.

00:10:28.227 --> 00:10:29.696
In four years,

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.133
they organized 20,000 residents
to collect data,

00:10:34.157 --> 00:10:37.061
map structures and put it together.

00:10:38.379 --> 00:10:39.910
And the plan was very simple --

00:10:39.934 --> 00:10:41.720
they only needed four things.

00:10:41.744 --> 00:10:43.696
They wanted clean water,

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.331
toilets, decent roads

00:10:46.355 --> 00:10:49.022
and, most importantly, not to be evicted.

00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:54.069
So they presented this
with the government of Nairobi.

00:10:54.492 --> 00:10:57.262
And for the first time in history ever,

00:10:57.286 --> 00:10:59.086
a city has agreed to do it.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.716
The city of Nairobi,
the government of Kenya,

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:05.212
declared Mukuru
to be a special planning area,

00:11:05.236 --> 00:11:08.467
which means that people
could come up with their own plan.

00:11:08.491 --> 00:11:12.291
People could decide to come up
with their own norms and standards,

00:11:12.315 --> 00:11:15.251
because the standards that work
for the formal citizens

00:11:15.275 --> 00:11:17.142
do not work in informal settings.

00:11:17.887 --> 00:11:20.648
So what does that mean,
to give us an instance?

00:11:21.736 --> 00:11:23.204
If these are roads in Mukuru,

00:11:23.228 --> 00:11:26.942
you can see that there are houses
along both sides of the road.

00:11:27.815 --> 00:11:30.712
Now in order to bring in a city bus,

00:11:30.736 --> 00:11:32.037
as per the standards,

00:11:32.061 --> 00:11:35.696
planners would have gone for
a luxurious 25-meter-wide road.

00:11:36.585 --> 00:11:41.133
Now that would mean displacing
[25] percent of the structures --

00:11:41.157 --> 00:11:42.623
that's a lot of people.

00:11:43.823 --> 00:11:47.782
So instead of doing that,
we came up with a 12-meter-wide road,

00:11:47.806 --> 00:11:50.719
which had the structures intact
and brought the city bus

00:11:50.743 --> 00:11:53.060
without compromising
on much services.

00:11:54.203 --> 00:11:58.204
In another instance,
let's talk about community toilets.

00:11:58.228 --> 00:11:59.785
You know, in high-density areas,

00:11:59.809 --> 00:12:02.633
where there is no scope
for individual toilets,

00:12:02.657 --> 00:12:04.950
like the public toilets that we have here.

00:12:05.665 --> 00:12:08.982
So we would go for a male section
and a female section.

00:12:09.894 --> 00:12:11.694
But imagine this situation.

00:12:12.141 --> 00:12:15.037
In the morning rush hours to the toilet,

00:12:15.061 --> 00:12:18.291
when everybody is in intense
pressure to relieve themselves,

00:12:18.315 --> 00:12:20.901
and if you're standing
in a queue of 50 people,

00:12:20.925 --> 00:12:23.734
and there is a child
standing behind an adult,

00:12:23.758 --> 00:12:24.908
who wins?

00:12:26.203 --> 00:12:28.470
Children end up squatting outside.

00:12:29.004 --> 00:12:31.077
And that's why women decided

00:12:31.101 --> 00:12:33.974
to come up with a separate
squatting area for children.

00:12:33.998 --> 00:12:36.429
Now, who could have thought
of something like that?

00:12:37.427 --> 00:12:40.304
The idea here is
that when poor people choose,

00:12:40.328 --> 00:12:41.884
they choose better.

00:12:41.908 --> 00:12:44.041
They choose what works for them.

00:12:45.551 --> 00:12:47.773
So choice is everything.

00:12:47.797 --> 00:12:49.939
And power decides choice.

00:12:50.363 --> 00:12:53.609
And we need those in power --

00:12:53.633 --> 00:12:56.426
politicians, leaders, governments,

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:59.651
architects, planners,
institutions, researchers --

00:12:59.675 --> 00:13:03.638
and all of us in our everyday lives
to respect choices.

00:13:04.857 --> 00:13:08.982
Instead of choosing what is right
for people, for the poor,

00:13:09.006 --> 00:13:11.939
let's acknowledge
and empower their choices.

00:13:12.307 --> 00:13:14.050
And that is how we can build

00:13:14.074 --> 00:13:16.515
better and inclusive cities for tomorrow,

00:13:16.539 --> 00:13:18.301
completing the imagery of cities

00:13:18.325 --> 00:13:20.959
built by the choices of its own people.

00:13:20.983 --> 00:13:22.134
Thank you.

00:13:22.158 --> 00:13:25.962
(Applause)
