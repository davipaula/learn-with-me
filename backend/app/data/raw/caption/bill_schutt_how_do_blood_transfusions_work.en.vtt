00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.992
In 1881, doctor William Halsted 
rushed to help his sister Minnie,

00:00:11.992 --> 00:00:14.692
who was hemorrhaging after childbirth.

00:00:14.692 --> 00:00:17.501
He quickly inserted 
a needle into his arm,

00:00:17.501 --> 00:00:21.250
withdrew his own blood, 
and transferred it to her.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.105
After a few uncertain minutes, 
she began to recover.

00:00:25.105 --> 00:00:27.880
Halsted didn’t know 
how lucky they’d gotten.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.740
His transfusion only worked 
because he and his sister

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.080
happened to have the same blood type—

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.959
something that isn’t guaranteed, 
even among close relatives.

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:39.890
Blood types hadn’t been discovered 
by Halsted’s time,

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.760
though people had been experimenting 
with transfusions for centuries—

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.160
mostly unsuccessfully.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.370
In 1667, a French physician 
named Jean-Baptiste Denis

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.642
became the first to try the technique 
on a human.

00:00:53.642 --> 00:00:57.631
Denis transfused sheep’s blood 
into Antoine Mauroy,

00:00:57.631 --> 00:01:00.171
a man likely suffering from psychosis,

00:01:00.171 --> 00:01:02.971
in the hopes that it would reduce 
his symptoms.

00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:05.711
Afterward, Mauroy was in good spirits.

00:01:05.711 --> 00:01:08.969
But after a second transfusion, 
he developed a fever,

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:13.171
severe pain in his lower back, 
intense burning in his arm,

00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:17.101
and he urinated a thick, black liquid.

00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:19.071
Though nobody knew it at the time,

00:01:19.071 --> 00:01:24.811
these were the signs of a dangerous 
immune response unfolding inside his&nbsp;body.

00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:28.171
This&nbsp;immune response starts&nbsp;
with&nbsp;the production of proteins

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:29.500
called&nbsp;antibodies,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.181
which distinguish the body’s 
own cells from intruders.

00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:37.601
They do so by recognizing 
the foreign proteins, or antigens,

00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:40.484
embedded in an intruder’s 
cell membrane.

00:01:40.484 --> 00:01:42.799
Antibodies latch onto the antigens,

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.452
signaling other immune cells to attack 
and destroy the foreign cells.

00:01:47.452 --> 00:01:50.952
The destroyed cells are flushed 
from the body in urine.

00:01:50.952 --> 00:01:54.321
In extreme cases, 
the massive break down of cells

00:01:54.321 --> 00:01:59.196
causes clots in the bloodstream that 
disrupt the flow of blood to vital organs,

00:01:59.196 --> 00:02:02.946
overload the kidneys, 
and cause organ failure.

00:02:02.946 --> 00:02:06.421
Fortunately, Denis’s patient 
survived the transfusion.

00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:10.221
But, after other cross-species 
transfusions proved fatal,

00:02:10.221 --> 00:02:13.134
the procedure was outlawed across Europe,

00:02:13.134 --> 00:02:16.274
falling out of favor 
for several centuries.

00:02:16.274 --> 00:02:21.066
It wasn’t until 1901 
that Austrian physician Karl Landsteiner

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:22.766
discovered blood types,

00:02:22.766 --> 00:02:27.786
the crucial step in the success 
of human to human blood transfusions.

00:02:27.786 --> 00:02:32.463
He noticed that when different types 
were mixed together, they formed clots.

00:02:32.463 --> 00:02:36.543
This happens when antibodies 
latch on to cells with foreign antigens,

00:02:36.543 --> 00:02:38.967
causing blood cells to clump together.

00:02:38.967 --> 00:02:43.284
But if the donor cells are the same 
blood type as the recipient’s cells,

00:02:43.284 --> 00:02:48.363
the donor cells won’t be flagged 
for destruction, and won’t form clumps.

00:02:48.363 --> 00:02:49.713
By 1907,

00:02:49.713 --> 00:02:54.476
doctors were mixing together small amounts
of blood before transfusing it.

00:02:54.476 --> 00:02:56.996
If there were no clumps, 
the types were a match.

00:02:56.996 --> 00:02:59.728
This enabled them 
to save thousands of lives,

00:02:59.728 --> 00:03:03.528
laying the foundation 
for modern transfusions.

00:03:03.528 --> 00:03:07.368
Up to this point, all transfusions 
had occurred in real time,

00:03:07.368 --> 00:03:10.194
directly between two individuals.

00:03:10.194 --> 00:03:13.428
That’s because blood 
begins to clot almost immediately

00:03:13.428 --> 00:03:15.588
after coming into contact with air—

00:03:15.588 --> 00:03:20.388
a defense mechanism to prevent 
excessive blood loss after injury.

00:03:20.388 --> 00:03:25.078
In 1914, researchers discovered 
that the chemical sodium citrate

00:03:25.078 --> 00:03:31.092
stopped blood coagulating by removing 
the calcium necessary for clot formation.

00:03:31.092 --> 00:03:34.532
Citrated blood could be stored 
for later use—

00:03:34.532 --> 00:03:39.484
the first step in making large scale 
blood transfusions possible.

00:03:39.484 --> 00:03:46.472
In 1916, a pair of American scientists 
found an even more effective anticoagulant

00:03:46.472 --> 00:03:51.791
called heparin, which works by 
deactivating enzymes that enable clotting.

00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:54.331
We still use heparin today.

00:03:54.331 --> 00:03:55.422
At the same time,

00:03:55.422 --> 00:03:59.342
American and British researchers 
developed portable machines

00:03:59.342 --> 00:04:04.584
that could transport donor blood 
onto the battlefields of World War I.

00:04:04.584 --> 00:04:07.034
Combined with 
the newly-discovered heparin,

00:04:07.034 --> 00:04:10.825
medics safely stored 
and preserved liters of blood,

00:04:10.825 --> 00:04:15.817
wheeling it directly onto the battlefield 
to transfuse wounded soldiers.

00:04:15.817 --> 00:04:20.523
After the war, this crude portable box 
would become the inspiration

00:04:20.523 --> 00:04:25.436
for the modern-day blood bank, 
a fixture of hospitals around the world.
