00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:17.768
So I've got something that I'm
slightly embarrassed to admit to.

00:00:17.792 --> 00:00:19.351
At the age of 17,

00:00:19.375 --> 00:00:21.184
as a creationist,

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:24.809
I decided to go to university
to study evolution

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:26.434
so that I could destroy it.

00:00:26.458 --> 00:00:28.143
(Laughter)

00:00:28.167 --> 00:00:29.434
I failed.

00:00:29.458 --> 00:00:33.309
I failed so spectacularly
that I'm now an evolutionary biologist.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:36.143
(Applause)

00:00:36.167 --> 00:00:39.476
So I'm a paleoanthropologist,
I'm a National Geographic Explorer

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.143
specializing in fossil hunting in caves

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:44.708
in unstable, hostile
and disputed territories.

00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:49.476
And we all know that
if I was a guy and not a girl,

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.684
that wouldn't be a job description,
that would be a pick-up line.

00:00:52.708 --> 00:00:54.893
(Laughter)

00:00:54.917 --> 00:00:57.351
Now, here's the thing.
I do not have a death wish.

00:00:57.375 --> 00:00:59.518
I'm not an adrenaline junkie.

00:00:59.542 --> 00:01:02.059
I just looked at a map.

00:01:02.083 --> 00:01:06.309
See, frontline exploratory science
does not happen as much

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.833
in politically unstable territories.

00:01:09.542 --> 00:01:13.309
This is a map of all the places
which the British Foreign Office

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:16.518
have declared contain
red zones, orange zones

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:19.809
or have raised some kind
of a threat warning about.

00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:23.018
Now I'm going to go out on a limb here
and say that it is a tragedy

00:01:23.042 --> 00:01:28.018
if we're not doing frontline exploratory
science in a huge portion of the planet.

00:01:28.042 --> 00:01:31.792
And so science has a geography problem.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.393
Also, as a paleoanthropologist,

00:01:35.417 --> 00:01:38.601
guys, this is basically a map
of some of the most important places

00:01:38.625 --> 00:01:40.393
in the human journey.

00:01:40.417 --> 00:01:44.601
There are almost definitely
fascinating fossils to be found here.

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:47.393
But are we looking for them?

00:01:47.417 --> 00:01:50.934
And so as an undergraduate,
I was repeatedly told

00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:55.518
that humans, be they ourselves,
homo sapiens, or earlier species,

00:01:55.542 --> 00:01:59.125
that we left Africa
via the Sinai of Egypt.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.476
I'm English, as you can
probably tell from my accent,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.518
but I am actually of Arab heritage,

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:08.226
and I always say that I'm
very, very Arab on the outside.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.059
You know, I can really be passionate.

00:02:10.083 --> 00:02:11.976
Like, "You're amazing! I love you!"

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.226
But on the inside, I'm really English,
so everybody irritates me.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.917
(Laughter)

00:02:20.208 --> 00:02:21.476
It's true.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.018
And the thing is,
my family are Arab from Yemen,

00:02:25.042 --> 00:02:28.643
and I knew that that channel,

00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:30.059
Bab-el-Mandeb,

00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:32.809
is not that much of a feat to cross.

00:02:32.833 --> 00:02:36.601
And I kept asking myself
this really simple question:

00:02:36.625 --> 00:02:42.059
if the ancestors to New World monkeys
could somehow cross the Atlantic Ocean,

00:02:42.083 --> 00:02:45.625
why couldn't humans cross
that tiny stretch of water?

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:48.351
But the thing is, Yemen,

00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:50.351
compared to, let's say, Europe,

00:02:50.375 --> 00:02:52.434
was so understudied

00:02:52.458 --> 00:02:55.708
that it was something akin
to near virgin territory.

00:02:56.917 --> 00:03:03.351
But that, along with its location,
made the sheer potential for discovery

00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:05.476
so exciting,

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.351
and I had so many questions.

00:03:08.375 --> 00:03:11.434
When did we first
start using Bab-el-Mandeb?

00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:16.226
But also, which species of human
besides ourselves made it to Yemen?

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.101
Might we find a species
as yet unknown to science?

00:03:20.125 --> 00:03:24.643
And it turned out, I wasn't the only one
who had noticed Yemen's potential.

00:03:24.667 --> 00:03:27.309
There was actually
a few other academics out there.

00:03:27.333 --> 00:03:32.351
But sadly, due to political instability,
they moved out, and so I moved in.

00:03:32.375 --> 00:03:35.559
And I was looking for caves:

00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:40.643
caves because caves
are the original prime real estate.

00:03:40.667 --> 00:03:44.643
But also because if you're looking
for fossils in that kind of heat,

00:03:44.667 --> 00:03:48.726
your best bet for fossil preservation
is always going to be caves.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.476
But then, Yemen took
a really sad turn for the worse,

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.393
and just a few days
before I was due to fly out to Yemen,

00:03:57.417 --> 00:04:01.143
the civil war escalated
into a regional conflict,

00:04:01.167 --> 00:04:03.268
the capital's airport was bombed

00:04:03.292 --> 00:04:05.542
and Yemen became a no-fly zone.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.684
Now, my parents made this decision
before I was born:

00:04:12.708 --> 00:04:14.583
that I would be born British.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
I had nothing to do
with the best decision of my life.

00:04:21.833 --> 00:04:23.268
And now ...

00:04:23.292 --> 00:04:28.434
Now the lucky ones
in my family have escaped,

00:04:28.458 --> 00:04:31.351
and the others, the others
are being been bombed

00:04:31.375 --> 00:04:35.958
and send you WhatsApp messages
that make you detest your very existence.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.309
This war's been going on for four years.

00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:47.583
It's been going on for over four years,
and it has led to a humanitarian crisis.

00:04:48.625 --> 00:04:50.518
There is a famine there,

00:04:50.542 --> 00:04:52.726
a man-made famine.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.434
That's a man-made famine,
so not a natural famine,

00:04:55.458 --> 00:04:59.018
an entirely man-made famine
that the UN has warned

00:04:59.042 --> 00:05:03.292
could be the worst famine
the world has seen in a hundred years.

00:05:04.417 --> 00:05:07.393
This war has made it
clear to me more than ever

00:05:07.417 --> 00:05:11.417
that no place, no people
deserve to get left behind.

00:05:13.083 --> 00:05:16.726
And so I was joining these other teams,
and I was forming new collaborations

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.934
in other unstable places.

00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:22.059
But I was desperate
to get back into Yemen,

00:05:22.083 --> 00:05:25.417
because for me, Yemen's really personal.

00:05:27.083 --> 00:05:32.143
And so I kept trying to think
of a project I could do in Yemen

00:05:32.167 --> 00:05:34.917
that would help highlight
what was going on there.

00:05:35.875 --> 00:05:39.101
And every idea I had just kept failing,

00:05:39.125 --> 00:05:42.726
or it was just too high-risk,
because let's be honest,

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.708
most of Yemen is just too dangerous
for a Western team.

00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:53.559
But then I was told that Socotra,
a Yemeni island,

00:05:53.583 --> 00:05:56.809
was safe once you got there.

00:05:56.833 --> 00:06:01.101
In fact, it turned out there was a few
local and international academics

00:06:01.125 --> 00:06:02.554
that were still working there.

00:06:03.417 --> 00:06:05.417
And that got me really excited,

00:06:06.667 --> 00:06:10.375
because look at Socotra's
proximity to Africa.

00:06:12.125 --> 00:06:17.375
And yet we have no idea
when humans arrived on that island.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.476
But Socotra, for those of you who know it,

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.101
well, let's just say you probably know it
for a completely different reason.

00:06:25.125 --> 00:06:28.143
You probably know it
as the Galapagos of the Indian Ocean,

00:06:28.167 --> 00:06:32.542
because it is one of the most
biodiverse places on this earth.

00:06:33.333 --> 00:06:35.768
But we were also getting information

00:06:35.792 --> 00:06:39.309
that this incredibly delicate
environment and its people

00:06:39.333 --> 00:06:40.726
were under threat

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.518
because they were at the frontline
of both Middle Eastern politics

00:06:44.542 --> 00:06:46.726
and climate change.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:52.018
And it slowly dawned on me
that Socotra was my Yemen project.

00:06:52.042 --> 00:06:57.059
And so I wanted to put together
a huge multidisciplinary team.

00:06:57.083 --> 00:07:01.393
We wanted to cross the archipelago
on foot, camel and dhow boat

00:07:01.417 --> 00:07:03.976
to conduct a health check of this place.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.851
This has only been attempted
once before, and it was in 1999.

00:07:07.875 --> 00:07:12.059
But the thing is, that is not
an easy thing to pull off.

00:07:12.083 --> 00:07:14.518
And so we desperately needed a recce,

00:07:14.542 --> 00:07:17.476
and for those of you who aren't
familiar with British English,

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.351
a recce is like a scouting expedition.

00:07:19.375 --> 00:07:20.893
It's like a reconnaissance.

00:07:20.917 --> 00:07:27.018
And I often say that a really big
expedition without a recce

00:07:27.042 --> 00:07:31.184
is a bit like a first date
without a Facebook stalk.

00:07:31.208 --> 00:07:32.809
(Laughter)

00:07:32.833 --> 00:07:35.226
Like, it's doable, but is it wise?

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:39.809
(Laughter)

00:07:39.833 --> 00:07:42.268
There's a few too many
knowing laughs in this room.

00:07:42.292 --> 00:07:48.809
Anyway, so then our recce team thankfully
were no strangers to unstable places,

00:07:48.833 --> 00:07:50.934
which, let's be honest,
is kind of important

00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:54.184
because we were trying to get
to a place between Yemen and Somalia,

00:07:54.208 --> 00:07:58.893
And after calling in
what felt like a million favors,

00:07:58.917 --> 00:08:01.018
including to the deputy governor,

00:08:01.042 --> 00:08:04.000
we finally found ourselves on the move,

00:08:05.375 --> 00:08:08.893
albeit on a wooden cement cargo ship

00:08:08.917 --> 00:08:12.184
sailing through pirate waters
in the Indian Ocean

00:08:12.208 --> 00:08:14.018
with this as a toilet.

00:08:14.042 --> 00:08:15.476
(Laughter)

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.125
Can you guys see this?

00:08:19.125 --> 00:08:22.542
You know how everybody has
their worst toilet story?

00:08:23.875 --> 00:08:26.875
Well, I've never swam
with dolphins before.

00:08:28.333 --> 00:08:30.518
I just went straight to pooping on them.

00:08:30.542 --> 00:08:32.917
(Laughter)

00:08:35.375 --> 00:08:42.101
And also, I genuinely discovered
that I am genuinely less stressed

00:08:42.125 --> 00:08:43.726
by pirate waters

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:47.308
than I am with a cockroach infestation

00:08:47.332 --> 00:08:49.268
that was so intense

00:08:49.292 --> 00:08:51.601
that at one point I went belowdeck,

00:08:51.625 --> 00:08:54.308
and the floor was black and it was moving.

00:08:54.332 --> 00:08:55.768
(Audience moans)

00:08:55.792 --> 00:09:00.059
Yeah, and at night there was
three raised platforms to sleep on,

00:09:00.083 --> 00:09:03.476
but there was only --
let's say there was four team members,

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.309
and the thing is, if you got
a raised platform to sleep on,

00:09:06.333 --> 00:09:09.601
you only had to contend
with a few cockroaches during the night,

00:09:09.625 --> 00:09:11.875
whereas if you got the floor,
good luck to you.

00:09:12.875 --> 00:09:16.518
And so I was the only girl in the team
and the whole ship,

00:09:16.542 --> 00:09:19.559
so I got away without
sleeping on the floor.

00:09:19.583 --> 00:09:21.976
And then, on, like,
the fourth or fifth night,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.667
Martin Edström looks at me and goes,
"Ella, Ella I really believe in equality."

00:09:27.167 --> 00:09:30.208
(Laughter)

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:36.809
So we were sailing on that
cement cargo ship for three days,

00:09:36.833 --> 00:09:40.500
and then we slowly started seeing land.

00:09:41.458 --> 00:09:44.018
And after three years of failing,

00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:45.792
I was finally seeing Yemen.

00:09:46.792 --> 00:09:51.518
And there is no feeling on earth
like that start of an expedition.

00:09:51.542 --> 00:09:54.768
It's this moment where
you jump out of a jeep

00:09:54.792 --> 00:09:57.101
or you look up from a boat

00:09:57.125 --> 00:09:59.934
and you know that
there's this possibility,

00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.018
it's small but it's still there,

00:10:02.042 --> 00:10:04.226
that you're about to find something

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:09.476
that could add to or change our knowledge
of who we are and where we come from.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.684
There is no feeling like it on earth,

00:10:12.708 --> 00:10:16.268
and it's a feeling
that so many scientists have

00:10:16.292 --> 00:10:20.476
but rarely in politically unstable places.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:25.309
Because Western scientists
are discouraged or all-out barred

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:27.750
from working in unstable places.

00:10:28.875 --> 00:10:30.143
But here's the thing:

00:10:30.167 --> 00:10:33.934
scientists specialize in the jungle.

00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:37.726
Scientists work in deep cave systems.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:42.351
Scientists attach themselves to rockets
and blow themselves into outer space.

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:44.643
But apparently,
working in an unstable place

00:10:44.667 --> 00:10:47.059
is deemed too high-risk.

00:10:47.083 --> 00:10:49.768
It is completely arbitrary.

00:10:49.792 --> 00:10:54.583
Who here in this room
wasn't brought up on adventure stories?

00:10:55.167 --> 00:10:59.708
And most of our heroes
were actually scientists and academics.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.893
Science was about going out
into the unknown.

00:11:03.917 --> 00:11:09.184
It was about truly global exploration,
even if there were risks.

00:11:09.208 --> 00:11:14.601
And so when did it become acceptable
to make it difficult for science to happen

00:11:14.625 --> 00:11:16.167
in unstable places?

00:11:17.833 --> 00:11:20.768
And look, I'm not saying
that all scientists should go off

00:11:20.792 --> 00:11:22.601
and start working in unstable places.

00:11:22.625 --> 00:11:24.684
This isn't some gung-ho call.

00:11:24.708 --> 00:11:26.250
But here's the thing:

00:11:27.792 --> 00:11:31.917
for those who have done the research,
understand security protocol

00:11:32.917 --> 00:11:34.184
and are trained,

00:11:34.208 --> 00:11:36.458
stop stopping those who want to.

00:11:37.083 --> 00:11:38.333
Plus,

00:11:39.417 --> 00:11:43.559
just because one part of a country
is an active war zone

00:11:43.583 --> 00:11:45.476
doesn't mean the whole country is.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.518
I'm not saying we should go
into active war zones.

00:11:48.542 --> 00:11:52.042
But Iraqi Kurdistan looks
very different from Fallujah.

00:11:52.917 --> 00:11:56.934
And actually, a few months
after I couldn't get into Yemen,

00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.601
another team adopted me.

00:11:58.625 --> 00:12:03.208
So Professor Graeme Barker's team
were actually working in Iraqi Kurdistan,

00:12:04.458 --> 00:12:07.351
and they were digging up Shanidar Cave.

00:12:07.375 --> 00:12:10.434
Now, Shanidar Cave a few decades earlier

00:12:10.458 --> 00:12:14.917
had unveiled a Neanderthal
known as Shanidar 1.

00:12:16.042 --> 00:12:20.393
Now, for a BBC/PBS TV series
we actually brought Shanidar 1 to life,

00:12:20.417 --> 00:12:23.458
and I want you guys to meet Ned,
Ned the Neanderthal.

00:12:25.625 --> 00:12:28.226
Now here's the coolest thing about Ned.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:30.351
Ned, this guy,

00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:33.684
you're meeting him before his injuries.

00:12:33.708 --> 00:12:37.976
See, it turned out
that Ned was severely disabled.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.601
He was in fact so disabled that
there is no way he could have survived

00:12:42.625 --> 00:12:45.226
without the help of other Neanderthals.

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.018
And so this was proof that,

00:12:47.042 --> 00:12:50.976
at least for this population
of Neanderthals at this time,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.851
Neanderthals were like us,

00:12:52.875 --> 00:12:56.667
and they sometimes looked after
those who couldn't look after themselves.

00:12:58.042 --> 00:13:01.309
Ned's an Iraqi Neanderthal.

00:13:01.333 --> 00:13:03.059
So what else are we missing?

00:13:03.083 --> 00:13:05.684
What incredible scientific discoveries

00:13:05.708 --> 00:13:08.542
are we not making
because we're not looking?

00:13:10.042 --> 00:13:13.851
And by the way, these places,
they deserve narratives of hope,

00:13:13.875 --> 00:13:17.309
and science and exploration
can be a part of that.

00:13:17.333 --> 00:13:20.643
In fact, I would argue
that it can tangibly aid development,

00:13:20.667 --> 00:13:25.250
and these discoveries
become a huge source of local pride.

00:13:25.833 --> 00:13:29.958
And that brings me to the second reason
why science has a geography problem.

00:13:31.833 --> 00:13:35.208
See, we don't empower
local academics, do we?

00:13:35.875 --> 00:13:37.851
Like, it's not lost on me

00:13:37.875 --> 00:13:40.708
that in my particular field
of paleoanthropology

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.893
we study human origins,

00:13:43.917 --> 00:13:47.292
but we have so few diverse scientists.

00:13:48.458 --> 00:13:52.101
And the thing is, these places
are full of students and academics

00:13:52.125 --> 00:13:54.518
who are desperate to collaborate,

00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:56.184
and the truth is

00:13:56.208 --> 00:13:57.934
that for them,

00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.542
they have fewer security issues than us.

00:14:02.458 --> 00:14:06.351
I think we constantly forget that for them
it's not a hostile environment;

00:14:06.375 --> 00:14:07.958
for them it's home.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.059
I'm telling you,

00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:15.559
research done in unstable places
with local collaborators

00:14:15.583 --> 00:14:18.934
can lead to incredible discoveries,

00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:23.458
and that is what we are
hoping upon hope to do in Socotra.

00:14:24.875 --> 00:14:26.125
They call Socotra

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:30.351
the most alien-looking place on earth,

00:14:30.375 --> 00:14:36.018
and myself, Leon McCarron, Martin Edström
and Rhys Thwaites-Jones could see why.

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:37.726
I mean, look at this place.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:41.018
These places, they're not hellholes,
they're not write-offs,

00:14:41.042 --> 00:14:44.708
they're the future frontline
of science and exploration.

00:14:46.042 --> 00:14:48.625
90 percent of the reptiles on this island,

00:14:49.708 --> 00:14:55.309
37 percent of the plant species
exist here and nowhere else on earth,

00:14:55.333 --> 00:14:57.893
and that includes this species
of dragon's blood tree,

00:14:57.917 --> 00:15:00.125
which actually bleeds this red resin.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.726
And there's something else.

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:07.518
People on Socotra,
some of them still live in caves,

00:15:07.542 --> 00:15:09.226
and that is really exciting,

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:12.309
because it means if a cave
is prime real estate this century,

00:15:12.333 --> 00:15:14.601
maybe it was a few thousand years ago.

00:15:14.625 --> 00:15:18.559
But we need the data to prove it,
the fossils, the stone tools,

00:15:18.583 --> 00:15:22.101
and so our scouting team
have teamed up with other scientists,

00:15:22.125 --> 00:15:24.393
anthropologists and storytellers,

00:15:24.417 --> 00:15:27.726
international as well as local,
like Ahmed Alarqbi,

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:30.934
and we are desperate
to shed a light on this place

00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.833
before it's too late.

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:38.101
And now, now we just somehow
need to get back

00:15:38.125 --> 00:15:40.434
for that really big expedition,

00:15:40.458 --> 00:15:42.143
because science,

00:15:42.167 --> 00:15:44.542
science has a geography problem.

00:15:45.625 --> 00:15:47.726
You guys have been
a really lovely audience.

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:49.018
Thank you.

00:15:49.042 --> 00:15:52.542
(Applause)
