00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.000
Meet Lucy.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.980
She was a math major in college,

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.110
and aced all her courses in probability 
and statistics.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.462
Which do you think is more likely: that 
Lucy is a portrait artist,

00:00:18.462 --> 00:00:23.490
or that Lucy is a portrait artist 
who also plays poker?

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.506
In studies of similar questions, up to 80 
percent of participants

00:00:27.506 --> 00:00:30.010
chose the equivalent 
of the second statement:

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.646
that Lucy is a portrait artist 
who also plays poker.

00:00:33.646 --> 00:00:38.368
After all, nothing we know about Lucy 
suggests an affinity for art,

00:00:38.368 --> 00:00:42.180
but statistics and probability 
are useful in poker.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.738
And yet, this is the wrong answer.

00:00:44.738 --> 00:00:46.528
Look at the options again.

00:00:46.528 --> 00:00:50.268
How do we know the first statement 
is more likely to be true?

00:00:50.268 --> 00:00:54.448
Because it’s a less specific version 
of the second statement.

00:00:54.448 --> 00:00:58.118
Saying that Lucy is a portrait artist 
doesn’t make any claims

00:00:58.118 --> 00:01:01.618
about what else she might or might not do.

00:01:01.618 --> 00:01:06.508
But even though it’s far easier to imagine
her playing poker than making art

00:01:06.508 --> 00:01:08.388
based on the background information,

00:01:08.388 --> 00:01:13.073
the second statement is only true if she 
does both of these things.

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:17.274
However counterintuitive it seems 
to imagine Lucy as an artist,

00:01:17.274 --> 00:01:23.227
the second scenario adds another condition
on top of that, making it less likely.

00:01:23.227 --> 00:01:27.756
For any possible set of events, the 
likelihood of A occurring

00:01:27.756 --> 00:01:33.478
will always be greater than the likelihood
of A and B both occurring.

00:01:33.478 --> 00:01:37.368
If we took a random sample of a million 
people who majored in math,

00:01:37.368 --> 00:01:41.520
the subset who are portrait artists might 
be relatively small.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.730
But it will necessarily be bigger

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.390
than the subset who are portrait artists 
and play poker.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.000
Anyone who belongs to the second group 
will also belong to the first–

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.490
but not vice versa.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.600
The more conditions there are, 
the less likely an event becomes.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.219
So why do statements with more conditions
sometimes seem more believable?

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.539
This is a phenomenon known as 
the conjunction fallacy.

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.339
When we’re asked to make quick decisions, 
we tend to look for shortcuts.

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:12.459
In this case, we look for what seems 
plausible

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.469
rather than what is statistically 
most probable.

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:19.900
On its own, Lucy being an artist doesn’t 
match the expectations

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.070
formed by the preceding information.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.810
The additional detail about 
her playing poker

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.170
gives us a narrative that resonates 
with our intuitions—

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.340
it makes it seem more plausible.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.681
And we choose the option that seems more
representative of the overall picture,

00:02:34.681 --> 00:02:37.631
regardless of its actual probability.

00:02:37.631 --> 00:02:41.221
This effect has been observed 
across multiple studies,

00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:44.901
including ones with participants 
who understood statistics well–

00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:47.615
from students betting on 
sequences of dice rolls,

00:02:47.615 --> 00:02:53.218
to foreign policy experts predicting 
the likelihood of a diplomatic crisis.

00:02:53.218 --> 00:02:57.556
The conjunction fallacy isn’t just a 
problem in hypothetical situations.

00:02:57.556 --> 00:03:00.686
Conspiracy theories and false news stories

00:03:00.686 --> 00:03:05.274
often rely on a version of the conjunction
fallacy to seem credible–

00:03:05.274 --> 00:03:08.904
the more resonant details are added 
to an outlandish story,

00:03:08.904 --> 00:03:11.754
the more plausible it begins to seem.

00:03:11.754 --> 00:03:14.644
But ultimately, the likelihood 
a story is true

00:03:14.644 --> 00:03:19.794
can never be greater than the probability 
that its least likely component is true.
