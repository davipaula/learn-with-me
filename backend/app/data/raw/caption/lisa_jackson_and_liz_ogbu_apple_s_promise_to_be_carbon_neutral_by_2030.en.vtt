Liz Ogbu: So Lisa,

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.851
Apple is on target
to become carbon neutral

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:20.266
across its entire business
and manufacturing supply chain

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.616
by 2030.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.463
Can you explain exactly what that means?

00:00:24.487 --> 00:00:25.648
Lisa Jackson: Sure.

00:00:25.672 --> 00:00:31.266
So today Apple is carbon neutral
for all of our own operations.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.554
And we're running
on 100 percent renewable energy

00:00:34.578 --> 00:00:36.456
for our corporate campuses,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.766
for our stores

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.486
and for our data centers.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.521
So we know how to do this work.

00:00:41.545 --> 00:00:46.041
The challenge for 2030
is to convert our supply chain,

00:00:46.065 --> 00:00:47.946
and that work has already begun.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.091
We already have 70 suppliers,

00:00:50.115 --> 00:00:53.996
over eight gigawatts
of energy coming online

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.826
in our supply chain,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.576
and then our last piece

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.456
will be to convert the energy
that our customers use

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.766
to charge our devices

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:03.964
to clean energy.

00:01:03.988 --> 00:01:05.916
LO: What are some of the biggest changes

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.813
that Apple's going to need to make
in its business operations

00:01:08.837 --> 00:01:10.853
in order to be able
to achieve those goals?

00:01:10.877 --> 00:01:15.026
LJ: So imagine if instead
of mining material

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.796
to go into Apple products,

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.406
we actually started
with recycled material.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.286
So we're not going all the way
back to the mine

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.816
through smelting,
transportation, processing.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.291
Instead, we're really talking
about reprocessing to some degree

00:01:30.315 --> 00:01:32.813
and putting that material
right back into products --

00:01:32.837 --> 00:01:37.836
super important with things
like conflict metals or rare earths.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.326
So Apple has been doing that work
now for several years.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.117
We've actually promised

00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:48.076
that we want to make all of our products
out of recycled and renewable materials.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.236
And so that investment

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.524
also means we get to take away
all the carbon emissions

00:01:53.548 --> 00:01:57.746
associated with everything up until
the point of the recycled material.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.616
LO: So it strikes me that you actually
hold a really interesting perspective.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.076
You know, you're now at Apple

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.056
and, like, deep in the business world
around these things,

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.716
but formerly, you actually led
the US Environmental Protection Agency

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.239
under the Obama administration,

00:02:13.263 --> 00:02:15.475
so you've seen
the government side as well.

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:17.284
What, in your mind, is the right way

00:02:17.308 --> 00:02:20.466
to look at the respective roles
of the state and the market

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.370
in fighting the climate crisis?

00:02:22.394 --> 00:02:25.986
LJ: I don't think there's anything
that business can do

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.666
that replaces the role
of government and leadership.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.337
Yes, I ran the EPA,

00:02:31.361 --> 00:02:35.016
but the other part of my history is
I worked there almost 20 years

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.330
before I became the head of the EPA.

00:02:38.354 --> 00:02:40.186
And you see firsthand, right,

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.336
that only government is really charged
with protecting its citizens.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.076
We always think protection,
and we think the military,

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.096
but I think the protection
of the Environmental Protection Agency

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.576
or the Air Quality Board in California

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.626
or a local health department

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.281
is as important to the day-to-day life
of the people in that jurisdiction

00:03:02.305 --> 00:03:06.694
as anything that the other security-type
protection can provide.

00:03:06.718 --> 00:03:09.703
Now, business is a different story.

00:03:09.727 --> 00:03:13.479
I think business has an incredibly
important role to play in leading,

00:03:13.503 --> 00:03:14.978
especially at this time.

00:03:15.002 --> 00:03:19.016
So when Apple said
its goal is 2030 carbon neutral --

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.616
obviously the UN is saying
2050 carbon neutral --

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.531
we decided to challenge ourselves
to go as fast as we could possibly do it

00:03:27.555 --> 00:03:31.372
so that other businesses
wouldn't have an excuse to say,

00:03:31.396 --> 00:03:32.570
"I need longer.

00:03:32.594 --> 00:03:33.887
I need much, much longer."

00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:37.186
I think it's great to see this moment

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.271
where suddenly there seems
to be a realization

00:03:40.295 --> 00:03:44.139
that climate change policy
cannot be foisted on others,

00:03:44.163 --> 00:03:47.266
but that, in fact, it has to be organic,

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.027
you know, for lack of a better word.

00:03:49.051 --> 00:03:50.822
And it's not an either-or.

00:03:50.846 --> 00:03:55.766
It's always been this weird, you know,
belief that we're taught from little

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.590
that you can either be successful
or you can do the right thing.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.496
There's no difference between the two;
it's a false choice.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.861
LO: Although a lot of us have been talking
about justice for some time,

00:04:06.885 --> 00:04:08.456
it is only recently that I think

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.176
this idea of justice as it relates
to the environment and climate

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.976
is making appearance
in a forum such as this.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.486
You've personally described
systemic racism and climate change

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.942
as interconnected issues,

00:04:21.966 --> 00:04:24.016
and I think it would
be great to hear more.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.906
LJ: To me, they're just the same thing.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.756
There is no climate justice
without real justice.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.374
There is no climate change remedy
that is going to be made and stick

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:35.247
that doesn't involve justice.

00:04:35.271 --> 00:04:38.086
And sometimes, more and more,
I'm starting to think

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.046
that we shouldn't attack climate change,

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.943
we should attack justice and injustice,

00:04:41.967 --> 00:04:44.601
and if we did, climate change
would take care of itself.

00:04:44.625 --> 00:04:46.173
For me, it's always come down to

00:04:46.197 --> 00:04:51.181
restoring people to the center
of the discussion of solutions

00:04:51.205 --> 00:04:54.498
and restoring representation

00:04:54.522 --> 00:04:59.236
for the communities
most impacted by climate change

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.780
at the table of solution-making.

00:05:01.804 --> 00:05:03.577
LO: Well, thank you. I appreciate it.

00:05:03.601 --> 00:05:06.037
It's been a real pleasure
to speak with you today,

00:05:06.061 --> 00:05:07.646
and I look forward to seeing

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.396
how you advanced the efforts
you talked about.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.515
LJ: And thank you
for the voice you've been.

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:18.016
I think it's super important
that leadership look like us,

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.226
but also sound like you.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.507
So thank you.
