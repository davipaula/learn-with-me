Transcriber: Ivana Korom
Reviewer: Joanna Pietrulewicz

00:00:13.375 --> 00:00:14.976
I'm a human rights lawyer.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.518
I've been a human rights
lawyer for 30 years,

00:00:17.542 --> 00:00:19.417
and this is what I know.

00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:24.708
Once there was a man alone in a room.

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:27.792
And his name was Alton.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.976
And then seven other men, seven strangers,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.726
rushed into his room and dragged him out.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.101
And they held him
in a horizontal, crucifix position.

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:42.059
One on each arm,

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:44.018
two on each leg,

00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:49.309
and the seventh man held Alton's neck
in a vice-like grip

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.143
between his forearms.

00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:53.226
And Alton was struggling for breath

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.184
and saying, "I can't breathe,"

00:00:55.208 --> 00:00:58.750
just as George Floyd said,
"I can't breathe."

00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:02.018
But they didn't stop.

00:01:02.042 --> 00:01:05.167
And soon, Alton was dead.

00:01:07.042 --> 00:01:13.726
When I was asked to represent
his mother and his brother and his sister

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.893
in the inquest into his death,

00:01:16.917 --> 00:01:20.601
they asked me, "How could it happen?"

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:22.625
And I didn't have an answer.

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:28.292
Because Alton had injuries
all over his body.

00:01:29.417 --> 00:01:33.018
He had bruising to his neck and his torso.

00:01:33.042 --> 00:01:36.601
He had injuries to his arms and his legs.

00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:41.125
He had blood in his eyes,
his ears and his nose.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.934
But they claimed no one knew anything.

00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:50.083
They claimed that they couldn't
explain how he died.

00:01:51.583 --> 00:01:53.833
For Alton had two problems.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.893
Firstly, the corridor in which he died

00:01:58.917 --> 00:02:01.542
was a prison corridor.

00:02:02.708 --> 00:02:05.417
And secondly, he was Black.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.893
So I want to talk to you today

00:02:08.917 --> 00:02:12.268
about Alton's mother's question.

00:02:12.292 --> 00:02:15.708
How could such a thing
happen in our country?

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.809
How can these things happen

00:02:18.833 --> 00:02:21.768
in countries across the world?

00:02:21.792 --> 00:02:24.184
How can they happen still,

00:02:24.208 --> 00:02:26.958
and what could we do to stop it?

00:02:29.542 --> 00:02:30.809
For three decades,

00:02:30.833 --> 00:02:34.934
I've been representing the families
of people of color

00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:39.393
who have been killed in state custody
in the United Kingdom.

00:02:39.417 --> 00:02:43.434
And I've done human rights work
across four continents.

00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:45.393
And what I've learned is this:

00:02:45.417 --> 00:02:48.726
that if we want to do
something about racism,

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.726
we have to first understand what it is.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.601
So let's talk about
this thing called race.

00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:58.000
What exactly is it?

00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:00.976
A fact of our lives?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.893
One of the most powerful
forces in the world?

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:07.351
Something we don't particularly
want to talk about?

00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:09.684
It is all these things,

00:03:09.708 --> 00:03:12.393
but it is something else.

00:03:12.417 --> 00:03:14.934
It is a myth.

00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:18.917
There is no such thing as race.

00:03:21.417 --> 00:03:26.643
Scientific research shows
that race is an illusion.

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:28.018
For example,

00:03:28.042 --> 00:03:31.101
someone of European descent

00:03:31.125 --> 00:03:35.601
might be genetically closer
to an Asian person

00:03:35.625 --> 00:03:38.375
than to someone else of European descent.

00:03:39.542 --> 00:03:43.393
So if race isn't a biological fact,

00:03:43.417 --> 00:03:45.250
what actually is it?

00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:49.851
It is a social construct.

00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:52.333
Which means it's been invented.

00:03:53.458 --> 00:03:55.875
But by whom and for what reason?

00:03:58.333 --> 00:04:05.309
As a species, we share 99.9 percent
of DNA with everybody else.

00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:08.143
But visible external characteristics,

00:04:08.167 --> 00:04:11.476
like hair type and skin color,

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.226
have been used in order
to promote this racist genetic lie

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.125
about the supposed
racial genetic differences.

00:04:21.667 --> 00:04:25.143
Racism has been endemic for centuries.

00:04:25.167 --> 00:04:30.684
The Nazis, of course, were very keen
to promote the racist lie.

00:04:30.708 --> 00:04:32.726
But also, in the United States,

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.500
there were eugenic experiments
and eugenic laws.

00:04:37.417 --> 00:04:39.184
And in Australia,

00:04:39.208 --> 00:04:46.018
children of dual Aboriginal heritage
were confiscated from their parents

00:04:46.042 --> 00:04:49.667
in order to create a white Australia.

00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:56.684
This kind of thinking is rising again
with alt-right groups

00:04:56.708 --> 00:05:00.667
hankering after racially pure homelands.

00:05:02.167 --> 00:05:03.792
How does this work?

00:05:04.625 --> 00:05:09.250
You see, we don't have
social inequalities because of race.

00:05:10.125 --> 00:05:15.042
We have social inequalities
that are justified by race.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.393
I started to understand this

00:05:18.417 --> 00:05:22.458
when I was representing
anti-apartheid activists.

00:05:23.292 --> 00:05:29.059
And they showed me how apartheid
was a system of social exploitation

00:05:29.083 --> 00:05:30.518
and discrimination

00:05:30.542 --> 00:05:33.143
that was justified by race.

00:05:33.167 --> 00:05:37.226
By the supposed superiority
of white people

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.833
and the supposed inferiority
of Black people.

00:05:42.458 --> 00:05:46.434
The apartheid regime said it was nature

00:05:46.458 --> 00:05:48.268
and so it was inevitable

00:05:48.292 --> 00:05:51.292
and there was nothing
you could do about it.

00:05:52.167 --> 00:05:58.583
The Mother Nature lie gives
discrimination and injustice a pass.

00:05:59.917 --> 00:06:01.934
I've also found it in cases

00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:08.018
where people suffer from the legacy
of colonization and empire.

00:06:08.042 --> 00:06:12.917
I've seen similar effects amongst people
of the same color in Africa.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:19.083
And how people of certain castes
are looked down upon in India.

00:06:20.667 --> 00:06:23.018
The victims may be different,

00:06:23.042 --> 00:06:24.518
but the mechanism --

00:06:24.542 --> 00:06:27.643
the labeling and the lies --

00:06:27.667 --> 00:06:29.750
is exactly the same.

00:06:30.625 --> 00:06:35.518
And so you can see why people
are so keen to embrace the race thing.

00:06:35.542 --> 00:06:37.768
Because it gives the privileged,

00:06:37.792 --> 00:06:40.351
people like us,

00:06:40.375 --> 00:06:42.458
a get out of jail free card.

00:06:44.542 --> 00:06:48.518
The simple truth is that race is a system.

00:06:48.542 --> 00:06:51.851
It's like oxygen, like an atmosphere.

00:06:51.875 --> 00:06:55.393
It flows everywhere in our society.

00:06:55.417 --> 00:06:59.309
It infects everybody it touches.

00:06:59.333 --> 00:07:02.167
It protects power and privilege.

00:07:03.625 --> 00:07:05.309
Whose?

00:07:05.333 --> 00:07:07.417
Well, look around you.

00:07:08.667 --> 00:07:10.934
So what is it like for people of color,

00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.434
people like me,

00:07:12.458 --> 00:07:14.934
to try to speak to white people

00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.458
about racism?

00:07:17.833 --> 00:07:22.726
Many, many white people
find it extremely difficult to do.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.667
Some white people say
they know nothing about it.

00:07:26.542 --> 00:07:29.684
Others say that our societies

00:07:29.708 --> 00:07:33.208
may not even suffer from racism at all.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.809
So if you are a white person
who is wondering about all of this,

00:07:39.833 --> 00:07:42.875
there is a thought experiment
that you can do.

00:07:44.542 --> 00:07:46.809
Because here's the truth.

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:48.143
You know.

00:07:48.167 --> 00:07:50.458
You already know.

00:07:51.458 --> 00:07:53.476
So ask yourself this:

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:58.393
Would you, would you really
want your son or your daughter,

00:07:58.417 --> 00:08:00.851
your brother or your sister,

00:08:00.875 --> 00:08:04.976
to marry a practicing Muslim
from the Middle East?

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.875
Or someone recently arrived
from South Asia, who is a Hindu?

00:08:10.833 --> 00:08:14.601
Or an asylum seeker
from Sub-Saharan Africa?

00:08:14.625 --> 00:08:19.917
Or someone who's recently crossed
the US-Mexican border?

00:08:21.417 --> 00:08:24.643
You may not have a total objection,

00:08:24.667 --> 00:08:27.167
but you may have a concern.

00:08:29.125 --> 00:08:33.976
A qualm that scratches
at the back of your brain.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.309
It's not because
of the color of their skin.

00:08:37.333 --> 00:08:40.809
But because you know
that in countries like ours,

00:08:40.833 --> 00:08:42.976
as things stand now,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.643
their life prospects are likely
to be affected by this union.

00:08:48.667 --> 00:08:50.976
And you realize that you do know,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.393
you do understand
that people will judge them.

00:08:55.417 --> 00:08:57.434
And in a hundred ways,

00:08:57.458 --> 00:09:00.934
those judgments will impact their lives

00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.125
and the lives of their children.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:06.059
At that moment,

00:09:06.083 --> 00:09:10.059
you are connecting with a powerful truth.

00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:15.583
Which is that you know
systemic racism is real.

00:09:16.708 --> 00:09:20.393
So why do you not want to talk about race?

00:09:20.417 --> 00:09:23.518
Because it's uncomfortable, certainly.

00:09:23.542 --> 00:09:26.726
But that's only part of the answer.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:30.601
The bigger truth is far more damaging.

00:09:30.625 --> 00:09:33.643
Your bristling isn't just defensiveness.

00:09:33.667 --> 00:09:37.059
It is a defense mechanism.

00:09:37.083 --> 00:09:39.476
It defends the system of privilege

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.917
and the unequal division
of wealth and power.

00:09:44.208 --> 00:09:48.083
Fragility gives racial inequality a pass.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.809
Who are the winners and losers?

00:09:51.833 --> 00:09:53.500
Well look at the data.

00:09:55.583 --> 00:09:57.268
In income.

00:09:57.292 --> 00:09:58.976
In health inequalities.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.726
In school exclusion.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.309
In career prospects.

00:10:02.333 --> 00:10:04.309
In stop and search.

00:10:04.333 --> 00:10:06.976
Look at how people of color

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.375
have been disproportionately
dying of COVID.

00:10:13.417 --> 00:10:17.768
So if the racial myth invisibilizes

00:10:17.792 --> 00:10:21.726
and the fragility response silences,

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:24.393
what choices are you left with?

00:10:24.417 --> 00:10:29.934
The binary choice between
you being a racist and a non-racist.

00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.726
Or is there another way?

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:36.101
Because almost everyone in this TED Talk

00:10:36.125 --> 00:10:40.101
will say that they are non-racist.

00:10:40.125 --> 00:10:41.809
But we have to face it,

00:10:41.833 --> 00:10:44.792
being non-something is not enough.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:50.583
The third choice
is being actively anti-racist.

00:10:51.625 --> 00:10:54.851
So if you agree that Black lives matter,

00:10:54.875 --> 00:10:56.893
ask yourself,

00:10:56.917 --> 00:11:00.351
"How do Black lives matter in my life?"

00:11:00.375 --> 00:11:02.434
"What have I done to show

00:11:02.458 --> 00:11:05.208
that Black lives matter to me?"

00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:12.268
By adopting a visible, conscious,
active anti-racist stance,

00:11:12.292 --> 00:11:16.393
what was once invisible is made visible.

00:11:16.417 --> 00:11:18.518
What was once silenced,

00:11:18.542 --> 00:11:22.458
is shouted out loud and clear.

00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.667
But that still is not enough.

00:11:30.208 --> 00:11:34.518
After weeks of bitter
struggle at the inquest,

00:11:34.542 --> 00:11:38.875
the all-white jury returned
to the courtroom in Alton's case.

00:11:40.708 --> 00:11:44.268
There was a moment of complete silence

00:11:44.292 --> 00:11:47.167
when the foreperson stood

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:51.458
and then he announced the verdict.

00:11:52.667 --> 00:11:56.518
And it was unlawful killing.

00:11:56.542 --> 00:11:57.851
And at that moment,

00:11:57.875 --> 00:12:00.101
all hell broke loose in the courtroom.

00:12:00.125 --> 00:12:02.792
And there was just this deafening noise.

00:12:04.375 --> 00:12:05.643
People were screaming,

00:12:05.667 --> 00:12:08.934
Alton's sister got up
into the aisle to my left

00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.643
and she was pointing
at the prison officers

00:12:11.667 --> 00:12:13.184
and shouting at them,

00:12:13.208 --> 00:12:15.059
"You killed my brother!

00:12:15.083 --> 00:12:16.958
You killed my brother!"

00:12:18.833 --> 00:12:22.476
And the family desperately wanted

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.726
that the prison officers
who were responsible for Alton's death

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.768
should be prosecuted.

00:12:28.792 --> 00:12:31.375
We all desperately wanted that.

00:12:32.208 --> 00:12:36.434
But not a single one of them
was prosecuted.

00:12:36.458 --> 00:12:39.851
So we took the chief prosecutor to court,

00:12:39.875 --> 00:12:42.375
the director of public prosecutions.

00:12:43.375 --> 00:12:45.934
And the highest judge in the land,

00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.601
the Lord Chief Justice,

00:12:47.625 --> 00:12:51.393
agreed that the decision not to prosecute

00:12:51.417 --> 00:12:54.458
was fatally flawed and unlawful.

00:12:58.417 --> 00:13:01.351
Every day during Alton's case,

00:13:01.375 --> 00:13:05.059
his brother would sit
on the courtroom steps

00:13:05.083 --> 00:13:06.601
and he would say to me,

00:13:06.625 --> 00:13:09.292
"Train them up good today, Mr. D."

00:13:11.917 --> 00:13:16.809
But when he realized
that nobody would ever be prosecuted

00:13:16.833 --> 00:13:19.476
for the killing of his brother,

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.750
it crushed him.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.458
And he died a few years later
in a psychiatric hospital.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:33.434
So how does Alton's death connect to you

00:13:33.458 --> 00:13:37.083
and to the racism and privilege
in our societies?

00:13:38.375 --> 00:13:40.042
What do I want from you?

00:13:41.375 --> 00:13:45.500
What I want from myself
is to be put out of a job.

00:13:46.792 --> 00:13:50.434
You see, families come to me
who are grieving

00:13:50.458 --> 00:13:52.976
and I see the hope in their eyes.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.559
And I have to tell them

00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:58.976
that the chances
of anybody ever being prosecuted

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.809
for being involved
in the killing of their loved ones

00:14:01.833 --> 00:14:03.917
are very remote.

00:14:05.875 --> 00:14:08.393
I saw these grieving faces

00:14:08.417 --> 00:14:11.393
in the springtime of my career.

00:14:11.417 --> 00:14:12.768
And I still see them

00:14:12.792 --> 00:14:15.559
now that I'm entering the autumn of it.

00:14:15.583 --> 00:14:19.000
And the summer season was full of blood.

00:14:20.375 --> 00:14:23.809
And somehow I think
that the blood is on my hands,

00:14:23.833 --> 00:14:27.434
even though I know rationally
that that is not the case.

00:14:27.458 --> 00:14:29.226
But I could not bring back

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:32.226
Alton or Gareth or Zahid

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:33.768
or any of the others,

00:14:33.792 --> 00:14:38.417
which is all their grieving
families ever wanted.

00:14:41.333 --> 00:14:44.292
So I'm asking you to see through the lies.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:50.101
And to see through one of the most
disempowering lies of them all.

00:14:50.125 --> 00:14:54.833
That what we do will not
and cannot make a difference.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.184
I'm sure they said that to Rosa Parks

00:14:58.208 --> 00:15:00.184
and to Martin Luther King

00:15:00.208 --> 00:15:02.518
and to Nelson Mandela.

00:15:02.542 --> 00:15:06.375
And they just went ahead
and did it anyway.

00:15:07.333 --> 00:15:09.226
And I tried to think of them

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:12.309
as I was cross-examining
the prison officers.

00:15:12.333 --> 00:15:13.976
And I would say to each of them,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.351
"Look at Mrs. Manning, Alton's mother,

00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:21.250
and you tell her why her son is dead."

00:15:22.417 --> 00:15:25.083
And not a single one of them
could look at her.

00:15:25.917 --> 00:15:29.583
They wanted her to be invisible.

00:15:31.917 --> 00:15:38.601
Sadly, realizing that no one
would be prosecuted for her boy's death,

00:15:38.625 --> 00:15:41.309
she sank into a deep depression

00:15:41.333 --> 00:15:42.583
and she died.

00:15:43.792 --> 00:15:47.559
But I'll never forget how,
in the chaos and mayhem,

00:15:47.583 --> 00:15:50.643
when that verdict was announced,

00:15:50.667 --> 00:15:52.309
I turned to her and said,

00:15:52.333 --> 00:15:56.208
"Mrs. Manning, I'm very sorry
for your family."

00:15:57.542 --> 00:15:59.184
And she looked at me and said,

00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:02.934
"Mr. Dias, you are family."

00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:07.184
And she pointed at the prison officers
and the jury and she said,

00:16:07.208 --> 00:16:08.809
"And they are family.

00:16:08.833 --> 00:16:11.351
But families bicker and fight,

00:16:11.375 --> 00:16:13.434
but we've got to sort it out.

00:16:13.458 --> 00:16:15.809
And we've got to find a way."

00:16:15.833 --> 00:16:18.875
So how do we sort it out and when?

00:16:20.542 --> 00:16:23.768
Dr. King taught us

00:16:23.792 --> 00:16:28.542
the time is always right
to do the right thing.

00:16:29.625 --> 00:16:33.018
These contentious deaths in state custody

00:16:33.042 --> 00:16:37.184
have taken place in prisons
and in police stations.

00:16:37.208 --> 00:16:40.726
But finally, the spotlight
has been shone on them

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:44.083
by the horrendous death of George Floyd.

00:16:45.042 --> 00:16:47.500
Now we can't say that we didn't know.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.809
The COVID crisis and George Floyd's death

00:16:51.833 --> 00:16:54.750
have shocked us out of our complacency.

00:16:56.042 --> 00:16:58.184
They put the world in flux,

00:16:58.208 --> 00:17:03.476
because what has been seen
cannot be unseen.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:08.042
So right now is a historic
moment of change.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:13.143
Now is the time to take action

00:17:13.167 --> 00:17:15.559
in our spheres of influence,

00:17:15.583 --> 00:17:17.042
and we all have them.

00:17:18.125 --> 00:17:19.684
We have voting power,

00:17:19.708 --> 00:17:21.393
we have pocket power,

00:17:21.417 --> 00:17:25.059
where we spend our money
and what we spend it on.

00:17:25.083 --> 00:17:30.583
We have the power to confront racism
wherever and whenever we find it.

00:17:32.625 --> 00:17:35.101
Those of you listening today,

00:17:35.125 --> 00:17:38.143
who have benefited from that privilege,

00:17:38.167 --> 00:17:41.809
have the opportunity
to turn it on its head

00:17:41.833 --> 00:17:45.167
and to demand that society changes.

00:17:46.833 --> 00:17:52.601
Ultimately what happens
is now in our hands.

00:17:52.625 --> 00:17:54.851
And this is what I know.

00:17:54.875 --> 00:17:59.518
When someone in state custody
says, "I can't breathe,"

00:17:59.542 --> 00:18:02.476
they are in mortal danger.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:06.601
But when a society doesn't challenge
the oxygen of racism

00:18:06.625 --> 00:18:09.893
that everyone breathes every day,

00:18:09.917 --> 00:18:14.643
the hope for racial justice
and equality in that society

00:18:14.667 --> 00:18:18.809
is also in mortal danger.

00:18:18.833 --> 00:18:21.768
There can't be any more Altons,

00:18:21.792 --> 00:18:24.059
and Gareths and Zahids,

00:18:24.083 --> 00:18:27.518
and Olasenis and Jimmys and Seans

00:18:27.542 --> 00:18:30.184
and Sherrys and Breonnas

00:18:30.208 --> 00:18:33.208
and Christophers and Georges.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.476
But this isn't just about deaths,

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.226
but about life.

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:42.726
And about our human flourishing together.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:45.708
And all of us are needed for that.

00:18:47.417 --> 00:18:50.476
Racism wants to stay invisible.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.101
Expose it.

00:18:52.125 --> 00:18:54.434
Racism wants your silence.

00:18:54.458 --> 00:18:56.268
Make a noise.

00:18:56.292 --> 00:18:58.559
Racism wants your apathy.

00:18:58.583 --> 00:19:02.809
Make a commitment now to use your voice

00:19:02.833 --> 00:19:05.018
and your privilege and your power

00:19:05.042 --> 00:19:08.768
to fight for racial justice always,

00:19:08.792 --> 00:19:14.226
and to join the crescendo of voices
calling for change.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.167
And to be part of the hope.

00:19:18.167 --> 00:19:19.542
Will you join us?
