00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:11.936
In 1898, Marie and Pierre Curie 
discovered radium.

00:00:11.936 --> 00:00:14.005
Claimed to have restorative properties,

00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:15.786
radium was added to toothpaste,

00:00:15.786 --> 00:00:16.657
medicine,

00:00:16.657 --> 00:00:17.418
water,

00:00:17.418 --> 00:00:18.615
and food.

00:00:18.615 --> 00:00:20.486
A glowing, luminous green,

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:24.007
it was also used in beauty products
and jewelry.

00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:26.297
It wasn't until the mid-20th century

00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:30.265
we realized that radium's harmful
effects as a radioactive element

00:00:30.265 --> 00:00:32.956
outweighed its visual benefits.

00:00:32.956 --> 00:00:35.876
Unfortunately, radium isn't the only
pigment that historically

00:00:35.876 --> 00:00:38.585
seemed harmless or useful

00:00:38.585 --> 00:00:40.535
but turned out to be deadly.

00:00:40.535 --> 00:00:44.037
That lamentable distinction includes
a trio of colors and pigments

00:00:44.037 --> 00:00:47.235
that we've long used to decorate ourselves
and the things we make:

00:00:47.235 --> 00:00:48.116
white,

00:00:48.116 --> 00:00:48.817
green,

00:00:48.817 --> 00:00:51.726
and orange.

00:00:51.726 --> 00:00:53.777
Our story begins with white.

00:00:53.777 --> 00:00:56.167
As far back as the 4th century BCE,

00:00:56.167 --> 00:01:01.397
the Ancient Greeks treated lead to make
the brilliant white pigment we know today.

00:01:01.397 --> 00:01:02.309
The problem?

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.938
In humans, lead is directly absorbed
into the body

00:01:05.938 --> 00:01:07.368
and distributed to the blood,

00:01:07.368 --> 00:01:08.217
soft tissues,

00:01:08.217 --> 00:01:10.568
and mineralized tissues.

00:01:10.568 --> 00:01:11.917
Once in the nervous system,

00:01:11.917 --> 00:01:15.177
lead mimics and disrupts the normal
functions of calcium,

00:01:15.177 --> 00:01:17.767
causing damages ranging 
from learning disabilities

00:01:17.767 --> 00:01:21.079
to high blood pressure.

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:23.578
Yet the practice 
of using this toxic pigment

00:01:23.578 --> 00:01:26.670
continued across time and cultures.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.858
Lead white was the only practical choice
for white oil or tempera paint

00:01:30.858 --> 00:01:32.908
until the 19th century.

00:01:32.908 --> 00:01:37.019
To make their paint, artists would grind
a block of lead into powder,

00:01:37.019 --> 00:01:40.088
exposing highly toxic dust particles.

00:01:40.088 --> 00:01:44.288
The pigment's liberal use resulted
in what was known as painter's colic,

00:01:44.288 --> 00:01:47.528
or what we'd now call lead poisoning.

00:01:47.528 --> 00:01:50.198
Artists who worked with lead complained
of palseys,

00:01:50.198 --> 00:01:51.159
melancholy,

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.039
coughing,

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.140
enlarged retinas,

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.758
and even blindness.

00:01:56.758 --> 00:01:59.929
But lead white's density, opacity,
and warm tone

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:04.771
were irresistible to artists like Vermeer,
and later, the Impressionists.

00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:06.402
Its glow couldn't be matched,

00:02:06.402 --> 00:02:11.659
and the pigment continued to be widely
used until it was banned in the 1970s.

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:13.271
As bad as all that sounds,

00:02:13.271 --> 00:02:15.770
white's dangerous effects 
pale in comparison

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.191
to another, 
more wide-spread pigment, green.

00:02:20.191 --> 00:02:24.110
Two synthetic greens called 
Scheele's Green and Paris Green

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.831
were first introduced in the 18th century.

00:02:27.831 --> 00:02:30.020
They were far more vibrant and flashy

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.241
than the relatively dull greens
made from natural pigments,

00:02:33.241 --> 00:02:35.620
so they quickly became popular choices
for paint

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.630
as well as dye for textiles,

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.630
wallpaper,

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.473
soaps,

00:02:39.473 --> 00:02:40.500
cake decorations,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.290
toys,

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.071
candy,

00:02:42.071 --> 00:02:43.661
and clothing.

00:02:43.661 --> 00:02:46.232
These green pigments were made from
a compound called

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:48.641
cupric hydrogen arsenic.

00:02:48.641 --> 00:02:50.509
In humans, exposure to arsenic

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:53.759
can damage the way cells 
communicate and function.

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:56.239
And high levels of arsenic have been
directly linked

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.600
to cancer and heart disease.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.421
As a result, 18th century fabric
factory workers were often poisoned,

00:03:03.421 --> 00:03:06.582
and women in green dresses 
reportedly collapsed

00:03:06.582 --> 00:03:09.622
from exposure to arsenic on their skin.

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:12.541
Bed bugs were rumored not to live
in green rooms,

00:03:12.541 --> 00:03:16.852
and it's even been speculated that
Napoleon died from slow arsenic poisoning

00:03:16.852 --> 00:03:20.851
from sleeping in his green 
wallpapered bedroom.

00:03:20.851 --> 00:03:24.370
The intense toxicity of these green
stayed under wraps

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.153
until the arsenic recipe was published
in 1822.

00:03:28.153 --> 00:03:32.022
And a century later, it was repurposed
as an insecticide.

00:03:32.022 --> 00:03:36.403
Synthetic green was probably the most
dangerous color in widespread use,

00:03:36.403 --> 00:03:39.833
but at least it didn't share radium's
property of radioactivity.

00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:43.093
Another color did, though - orange.

00:03:43.093 --> 00:03:47.293
Before World War II, it was common
for manufacturers of ceramic dinnerware

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:50.443
to use uranium oxide in colored glazes.

00:03:50.443 --> 00:03:52.974
The compound produced brilliant
reds and oranges,

00:03:52.974 --> 00:03:57.234
which were appealing attributes,
if not for the radiation they emitted.

00:03:57.234 --> 00:04:01.693
Of course, radiation was something
we were unaware of until the late 1800s,

00:04:01.693 --> 00:04:06.460
let alone the associated cancer risks,
which we discovered much later.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.754
During World War II,

00:04:07.754 --> 00:04:12.583
the U.S. government confiscated all uranium
for use in bomb development.

00:04:12.583 --> 00:04:17.805
However, the atomic energy commission
relaxed these restrictions in 1959,

00:04:17.805 --> 00:04:22.444
and depleted uranium returned to ceramics
and glass factory floors.

00:04:22.444 --> 00:04:24.395
Orange dishes made during 
the next decade

00:04:24.395 --> 00:04:28.264
may still have some hazardous qualities
on their surfaces to this day.

00:04:28.264 --> 00:04:33.045
Most notably, vintage fiestaware
reads positive for radioactivity.

00:04:33.045 --> 00:04:36.975
And while the levels are low enough that
they don't officially pose a health risk

00:04:36.975 --> 00:04:38.584
if they're on a shelf,

00:04:38.584 --> 00:04:44.159
the U.S. EPA warns against eating food
off of them.

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:48.034
Though we still occasionally run 
into issues with synthetic food dyes,

00:04:48.034 --> 00:04:53.135
our scientific understanding has helped us
prune hazardous colors out of our lives.
