00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.373
Let's start with silence.

00:00:23.028 --> 00:00:27.513
Silence is one of the most
precious conditions for humans,

00:00:27.537 --> 00:00:30.901
because it allows us to feel
the depth of our presence.

00:00:32.072 --> 00:00:35.310
This is one of the reasons
why the advent of electric cars

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:38.207
has generated lots
of enthusiasm among people.

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:43.056
For the first time, we could associate
the concept of cars

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.841
with the experience of silence.

00:00:45.824 --> 00:00:47.849
Cars can finally be quiet:

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.223
peace in the streets,

00:00:50.247 --> 00:00:52.659
a silent revolution in the cities.

00:00:56.762 --> 00:01:03.143
(Hum)

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.826
But silence can also be a problem.

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:12.779
The absence of sound, in fact,
when it comes to cars,

00:01:12.803 --> 00:01:14.088
it can be quite dangerous.

00:01:14.907 --> 00:01:16.946
Think of blind people,

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.153
who can't see a car which is approaching.

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.295
And now, if it's electric,
they can't even hear it.

00:01:24.038 --> 00:01:27.398
Or think of every one of us
as we are walking around the city,

00:01:27.422 --> 00:01:31.323
we are absorbed in our thoughts,
and we detach from the surroundings.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.027
In these situations, sound can become
our precious companion.

00:01:38.552 --> 00:01:43.084
Sound is one of the most
wonderful gifts of our universe.

00:01:43.108 --> 00:01:44.306
Sound is emotion

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.822
and sound is sublime,

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.648
and when it comes to cars,
sound is also information.

00:01:53.606 --> 00:01:55.536
In order to protect pedestrians

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.535
and to give acoustic
feedback to the drivers,

00:01:58.559 --> 00:02:02.771
governments around the world
have introduced several regulations

00:02:02.795 --> 00:02:06.604
which prescribe the presence of a sound
for electric vehicles.

00:02:07.454 --> 00:02:11.248
In particular, they require
minimum sound levels

00:02:11.272 --> 00:02:13.441
at specific frequency bands

00:02:13.465 --> 00:02:16.004
up to the speed of 30 kilometers per hour.

00:02:17.798 --> 00:02:19.029
Besides this speed,

00:02:19.053 --> 00:02:22.710
the natural noise of the car
is considered as sufficient.

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:28.586
These regulations
have generated different reactions

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.587
among those who favor sounds
and those who fear the presence

00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:34.284
of too much noise in the city.

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.429
However, I don't see it
as the noise of the car.

00:02:41.792 --> 00:02:45.040
I rather see it as the voice of the car.

00:02:46.422 --> 00:02:50.009
And this is one of my biggest challenges,
and privileges, at the same time.

00:02:50.954 --> 00:02:53.350
I design the voice of electric cars.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.279
We all know how a combustion
engine sounds like,

00:02:59.303 --> 00:03:02.625
and we do actually also know
how an electric engine sounds like.

00:03:03.276 --> 00:03:05.435
Think of the electric tramway.

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.673
As soon as it moves,

00:03:06.697 --> 00:03:10.496
it creates this ascending
high-frequency pitch sound,

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.387
which we called "whistling" sound.

00:03:13.907 --> 00:03:17.249
However, if we would
just amplify this sound,

00:03:17.273 --> 00:03:21.059
we would still not be able to fulfill
the legal requirements.

00:03:21.083 --> 00:03:24.448
That's also why we need
to compose new sound.

00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:27.551
So how do we go after it?

00:03:29.178 --> 00:03:32.716
In many cities, the traffic
is already very chaotic,

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.352
and we don't need more chaos.

00:03:35.221 --> 00:03:40.298
But the streets of the 21st century
are a great case study

00:03:40.322 --> 00:03:44.052
teeming with transience,
cross purposes and disarray.

00:03:45.337 --> 00:03:48.592
And this landscape
offers a great opportunity

00:03:48.616 --> 00:03:52.806
for developing new solutions
on how to reduce this chaos.

00:03:54.663 --> 00:03:59.133
I have conceived a new approach
that tries to reduce the chaos

00:03:59.157 --> 00:04:00.924
by introducing harmony.

00:04:02.898 --> 00:04:07.041
Since many people don't know
how an electric car could sound like,

00:04:07.065 --> 00:04:11.354
I have to define, first of all,
a new sound world,

00:04:11.378 --> 00:04:15.031
something that doesn't belong
to our previous experience

00:04:15.055 --> 00:04:17.521
but creates a reference for the future.

00:04:19.072 --> 00:04:23.397
Together with a small team,
we create lots of sonic textures

00:04:23.421 --> 00:04:27.159
that are able to transmit emotion.

00:04:28.064 --> 00:04:30.237
Just like a painter with colors,

00:04:30.261 --> 00:04:34.734
we are able to connect
feelings and frequencies

00:04:34.758 --> 00:04:37.238
so that whenever one is approaching a car,

00:04:37.262 --> 00:04:39.077
we can feel an emotion

00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:43.007
which, besides fulfilling
the legal requirements,

00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:46.982
speaks also about the character
and the identity of the car.

00:04:49.837 --> 00:04:52.941
I call this paradigm "sound genetics."

00:04:54.433 --> 00:05:00.077
With sound genetics, I define,
first of all, an aesthetic space of sound,

00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:04.303
and at the same time,
I search for new, innovative methods

00:05:04.327 --> 00:05:07.140
for generating soundscapes
that we don't know,

00:05:08.533 --> 00:05:13.191
soundscapes that allow us
to envision abstract worlds,

00:05:14.083 --> 00:05:16.128
to make them tangible and audible.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.427
Sound genetics is based on three steps.

00:05:22.266 --> 00:05:25.959
The first one is the definition
of a sonic organism,

00:05:27.313 --> 00:05:30.892
the second one is a description
of sonic variations,

00:05:31.884 --> 00:05:36.130
and the third one
is the composition of sound genes.

00:05:38.732 --> 00:05:44.427
The description of a sonic organism
is based on a cluster of properties

00:05:44.451 --> 00:05:47.828
that every sound
that I compose should have.

00:05:50.804 --> 00:05:52.317
[Sound is moving.]

00:05:52.341 --> 00:05:57.601
I transfer to a small sound entity,
such as the sound of a car,

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.339
the power of the motion of music,

00:06:01.363 --> 00:06:02.957
so that sound can move so.

00:06:04.313 --> 00:06:05.698
[Sound is acting.]

00:06:05.722 --> 00:06:07.641
And just like a dancer on a stage,

00:06:07.665 --> 00:06:11.895
sound will project trajectories
of sound in the air.

00:06:14.287 --> 00:06:15.438
[Sound is memory.]

00:06:15.462 --> 00:06:17.625
And it's not just about
the sound of a car.

00:06:18.448 --> 00:06:21.423
It's the memory of my father
coming back home.

00:06:23.737 --> 00:06:25.274
[Sound is hypnotizing.]

00:06:25.298 --> 00:06:30.949
And sound has the power to create
an unexpected sense of wonder,

00:06:30.973 --> 00:06:32.400
which hypnotizes.

00:06:34.004 --> 00:06:35.171
And ultimately,

00:06:35.195 --> 00:06:36.670
[Sound is superhuman.]

00:06:36.694 --> 00:06:38.694
sound goes beyond the human condition,

00:06:38.718 --> 00:06:41.361
because it allows us to transcend.

00:06:44.544 --> 00:06:48.845
As a second step,
we define the sonic variations.

00:06:49.297 --> 00:06:50.471
[Identity prism]

00:06:50.495 --> 00:06:54.594
Just like humans, where different bodies
generate different voices,

00:06:54.618 --> 00:06:59.872
also different car shapes
have a different acoustic behavior

00:06:59.896 --> 00:07:02.665
which depends on
the geometry and the materials.

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:10.063
So we have to know, first of all,
how this car propagates the sound outside

00:07:10.087 --> 00:07:11.999
by means of acoustic measurements.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:19.443
And just like a single voice is able
to produce different tones and timbres,

00:07:19.467 --> 00:07:22.912
at the same time, we produce
different sonic variations

00:07:22.936 --> 00:07:27.229
within a space
of eight words that I defined.

00:07:28.074 --> 00:07:30.921
And some of them are,
to me, really important,

00:07:30.945 --> 00:07:33.209
such as the concept of "visionary,"

00:07:33.233 --> 00:07:36.649
of "elegance,"
of "dynamic," of "embracing."

00:07:39.757 --> 00:07:42.931
And once we have defined
these two aspects,

00:07:42.955 --> 00:07:46.011
we have what I call the identity prism,

00:07:46.035 --> 00:07:50.216
which is something like
the sonic identity card of a car.

00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:57.970
And as a third step,
we enter the world of the sound design,

00:07:59.046 --> 00:08:01.831
where the sound genes are composed

00:08:01.855 --> 00:08:04.198
and a new archetype is conceived.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.073
Now let me show you another example

00:08:08.097 --> 00:08:12.363
of how I transform
a sound field into a melody.

00:08:13.847 --> 00:08:16.562
Think that I am a violin player on stage.

00:08:16.586 --> 00:08:18.332
If I would start to play the violin,

00:08:18.356 --> 00:08:22.332
I would generate a sound field
which would propagate in this hall,

00:08:22.356 --> 00:08:26.095
and at some point, the sound field
would hit the side walls

00:08:26.119 --> 00:08:29.688
and would be scattered all over the place.

00:08:29.712 --> 00:08:31.293
And this is how it looked like.

00:08:31.317 --> 00:08:37.165
Some time ago, I captured
several ways of sound to hit side walls.

00:08:38.321 --> 00:08:42.424
And last year, I was asked
by the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra

00:08:42.448 --> 00:08:46.280
to compose ringtones
that they were going to play.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:51.203
So one of them, I had the idea
to start from this sound field.

00:08:51.728 --> 00:08:53.622
I took a section,

00:08:53.646 --> 00:08:56.408
I superimposed the section
over the distribution

00:08:56.432 --> 00:08:58.706
of the musicians onstage,

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.560
and then I followed
the blooming of the sound field

00:09:01.584 --> 00:09:03.007
by means of three parameters:

00:09:04.146 --> 00:09:05.785
time, intensity and frequency.

00:09:06.996 --> 00:09:11.858
Then I wrote down all the gradients
for each instrument,

00:09:11.882 --> 00:09:13.473
and as you can see, for instance,

00:09:13.497 --> 00:09:17.959
the piece will start with
the string section playing very softly,

00:09:17.983 --> 00:09:23.946
and then it's going to have a crescendo
as the brasses, the woods will jump in,

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.927
and the melody will end
with a harp and a piano

00:09:27.951 --> 00:09:30.125
playing on the highest range.

00:09:34.457 --> 00:09:36.800
Let's listen how it sounded like.

00:09:39.495 --> 00:09:46.359
(Ethereal music)

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.390
(Music ends)

00:09:59.895 --> 00:10:03.122
So this is the sound of my alarm clock,
actually, in the morning.

00:10:03.146 --> 00:10:04.296
(Laughter)

00:10:05.707 --> 00:10:08.066
And now let's go back to electric cars.

00:10:09.338 --> 00:10:14.782
And let's listen to the first example
that I showed you.

00:10:20.089 --> 00:10:27.089
(Hum)

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:33.680
And now I would like to show you
how a potential sound,

00:10:33.704 --> 00:10:38.473
based on the sound genetics
for electric cars, could sound like.

00:10:39.926 --> 00:10:43.513
(Ethereal music)

00:10:43.537 --> 00:10:49.837
(Pitch rises with acceleration)

00:10:52.365 --> 00:10:59.135
Cars are a metaphor of time,
distance and journey,

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:02.280
of setting out and returning,

00:11:02.304 --> 00:11:05.085
of anticipation and adventure,

00:11:05.109 --> 00:11:10.244
but, at the same time,
of intelligence and complexity,

00:11:10.268 --> 00:11:13.234
of human intuition and accomplishment.

00:11:13.258 --> 00:11:15.750
And the sound has to glorify all that.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:21.886
I see cars both as living creatures

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:25.965
and as highly complex
performative art installations.

00:11:27.984 --> 00:11:31.585
The sounds that we envision
through sound genetics

00:11:31.609 --> 00:11:35.287
allow us not only
to celebrate this complexity

00:11:36.735 --> 00:11:41.497
but also to make the world
a more elegant and safe space.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.222
Thank you.

00:11:43.246 --> 00:11:46.325
(Applause)
